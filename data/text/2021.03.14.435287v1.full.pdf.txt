 ;    Targeting reactive oxygen species (ROS) while maintaining cellular redox signaling is crucial in the development of redox medicine for the therapeutic benefit as the origin of several prevailing diseases including chronic kidney disease (CKD) is linked to ROS imbalance and associated mitochondrial dysfunction
 Here, we have shown that an functionalized by biocompatible ligand citrate (C-Mn3O4 NPs) can maintain cellular redox balance in an animal model
 We developed a cisplatin-induced CKD model in C57BL/6j mice where severe mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in oxidative distress lead to the pathogenesis
 Four weeks of treatment with C-Mn3O4 NPs restored renal function, cytokines, and arrested glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis in CKD mice
 A detailed study involving human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells and isolated mitochondria from action of the nanomedicine involves protection of structural and functional integrity of mitochondria from oxidative damage, the subsequent reduction in intracellular ROS, and maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis
 To the best of our knowledge, such studies that efficiently treated a multifaceted disease like CKD using a biocompatible redox nanomedicine are sparse in the literature

 ;    Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have long been considered as an unwanted but inevitable byproduct of aerobic oxygen metabolism []
 Excessive generation of ROS may lead to is linked to inflammation, aging, and pathogenesis of diseases like diabetes, cancer, understanding about the pivotal role of ROS as secondary messengers in cellular signaling to control processes like metabolism, energetics, cell survival, and death lead to a paradigm shift to the traditional oxidants are bad  antioxidants are good based simplistic view of redox biology [-]
 Apathy towards the paradox between lethality of excessive intracellular ROS (oxidative distress) and beneficial role of low concentration ROS (oxidative eustress) is the major underlying reason behind the failure of conventional acid, -carotene, curcumin, and numerous polyphenols present in the diet) that along with scavenging intracellular free radicals in a stoichiometric way, insulates redox signaling [-]
 Moreover, meta-analyses of clinical trials show that conventional antioxidants are not only ineffective, but harmful, and even increase mortality [12, ]
 The understanding that proper cell functioning critically requires a dynamic balance between oxidative eustress and distress (i
 e
, cellular redox homeostasis) forms the conceptual framework of redox medicine, a novel therapeutics that passivates the oxidative distress while maintains the normal redox circuitry [10, 12, -]
 The cellular redox dynamics and its regulations, however, are still largely elusive because of the lack of effective pharmacological interventions []
 In this regard, biocompatible transition metal oxide nanoparticles with potential electron-donating as well as accepting capability could be a viable option provided they are stable in the biological system, able to assimilate in the targeted tissue, Recently, we have shown that spinel structured citrate functionalized Mn3O4 nanoparticles (C-Mn3O4 NPs) have the unique ability to generate ROS in dark, and when injected into jaundiced animals can selectively degrade bilirubin (a toxic byproduct of heme metabolism) without showing adverse effects to other blood parameters []

 Hence, depending upon the intracellular redox condition, the nanoparticle has the potential to balance the oxidative distress and eustress, the most important feature of a In this study, our major aim was to evaluate the potential of C-Mn3O4 NPs as a redox medicine against CKD
 CKD, the progressive decline in kidney function, is one of the most serious global public health problem (with 8-16% worldwide prevalence) that originates from redox imbalance due to mitochondrial dysfunction and have no effective medicine till date [-]
 To evaluate the therapeutic potential of C-Mn3O4 NPs we used a cisplatin-induced C57BL/6j mice model of CKD

 ;    The size, surface charge, and surface functionalized ligands determine the biodistribution of a nanomaterial inside living organisms
 Previous studies have reported that particles with less than 8 nm diameters having moderate to high surface negative charge tend to accrue in the renal system []
 So, care was taken at the time of synthesis to control the size of the Mn3O4 nanoparticles within the range of 6 nm
 The transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of C-Mn3O4 NPs shows monomodal distribution of nearly spherical particles with an average diameter of 
 
42 nm (Figure a)

 ;    Mn3O4 NPs efficiently prevented the RB from H2O2 mediated degradation (Supplementary C-Mn3O4 NPs maintain redox balance in HEK 293 cells against H2O2-induced oxidative To test the ability of C-Mn3O4 NPs to combat oxidative stress in the cellular environment, we used a cell-based approach
 The HEK 293 cells pretreated with different concentrations of nanoparticles (
75 to 60 g mL-1) were exogenously exposed to H2O2 (1 mM) and cell diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Figure a)
 The survival rate for H2O2 treated cells was ~35% (p<
001 compared to control)
 The C-Mn3O4 NPs protected the cells from H2O2 induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner
 Cell viability reached a maximum of ~85% and ~88% (p<
001 compared to H2O2 treated cells) in H2O2 exposed cells when pretreated with 30 and 60 g mL-1 NPs respectively
 Pretreatment of the cells with similar concentrations of the NPs alone did not cause significant cellular mortality
 Therefore, we selected the 30 g mL-1 concentration of C-Mn3O4 NPs for further experiments
 Identical results were observed in the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay (Figure b)
 The presence of a high concentration of H2O2 inside the cell caused oxidative damage to the plasma membrane resulting in an increased release of LDH, a cytosolic enzyme, into the surrounding cell culture medium
 Pretreatment with C-Mn3O4 NPs protected the cells from H2O2 induced oxidative damage resulting in a ~40% reduction in the LDH release (p<
001 compared to H2O2 treated cells)
 To evaluate the scavenging of H2O2 by C-Mn3O4 NPs under stress condition, we monitored the intracellular oxidative stress using a ROS-DCFDA-H2 is transported across the cell membrane and hydrolyzed by intracellular converted to highly fluorescent 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) in the presence of reactive oxygen species
 H2O2 exposure caused a substantial increase in the cellular ROS level indicated in the enhanced the relative green fluorescence (em/DCFDA-H2=520 nm) intensity of DCFDA-H2 when measured with fluorescence microscopy (Figure 2c & 2d) or flow cytometry (Figure e)
 However, pretreatment with 30 g mL-1 C-Mn3O4 NPs significantly lowered intracellular ROS level which was reflected in decreased fluorescence (~ 50% reduction; p<

 ;    observations in differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (Figure 2d) support the results of cell viability and oxidative damage evaluation
 The cells pretreated with C-Mn3O4 NPs prevented the shrinkage and congregation of the cell body due to H2O2 Mitochondria despite being the primary source of intracellular ROS and its control is the most susceptible organelle to oxidative damage leading to redox imbalance and cell death [28, ]
 So, to get further insight into the free radical scavenging activity of C-Mn3O4 NPs drastically decreased the m, as measured by enhanced rhodamine 123 (Rh123) fluorescence (Figure 2f; Supplementary Figure S2a) along with a burst in mitochondrial ROS production, as indicated by the increased fluorescence of Mito-sox red (Figure 2f; Supplementary Figure Sb)
 Pretreatment with 30 g mL-1 C-Mn3O4 NPs significantly restored the m and reduced the mitochondrial ROS
 m has a causal relationship with mPTP
 The results of Ca2+ induced mitochondrial swelling assay indicated that the NPs were effective in preventing the H2O2 induced mPTP opening (Figure 2g) and maintaining opening of mPTP led to a significant fall in the cellular ATP content (Figure h)
 In C-Mn3O4 NPs pretreated cells, such loss in ATP content was not observed
 The opening of mPTP, fall in m and ATP content cumulatively functions as a proapoptotic signal to initiate the cell death pathways
 Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and works in consort with mitochondria [-]
 The accumulation of highly reactive oxygen radicals causes damage to biomolecules in cells and alters enzyme activities [-]
 Hence, we extended our study towards evaluating the effect of H2O2 and C-Mn3O4 NPs in the ROS regulatory network
 H2O2 exposure significantly reduced the activity of SOD, CAT, and GPx resulting in a decrease of the reducing pool of cellular thiol constituents (e

, GSH) (Figure i-k)

 ;    Thus, our cellular studies indicate that C-Mn3O4 NPs possess the distinctive property of enzymes and maintaining high cell viability by acting as a protector of mitochondria, the master regulator of cellular redox equilibrium (Figure 2l schematically summarizes the There is always a gap in the efficacies of a pharmacological agent tested between cellular metabolism often restricts the use of a cytoprotective agent in vivo [-]
 Thus, we evaluated the potential of C-Mn3O4 NPs in the treatment of cisplatin-induced C57BL/6j mice, a well-known animal model for testing therapeutic interventions against CKD [-]
 Chronic administration of cisplatin resulted in significant mortality (~40% compared to control) (Figure a)
 The fourfold higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) content (Figure 3b), threefold higher GFR (Table 1), fourfold higher urinary albumin excretion (albuminuria) (Figure 3c) and high urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) (Table 1) along with significantly increased serum urea (Figure 3d) and creatinine (Figure 3e) illustrated induction of proteinuria and notable damage to the renal function of mice, the two hallmarks of CKD [-]
 Treatment with C-Mn3O4 NPs (
25 mg kg(BW)) considerably reduced BUN, GFR, urinary albumin, ACR, serum urea, and creatinine (Figure 3b-3e; Table )
 The treatment also improved survivability (Log-rank p=
022; hazards ratio 
62) (Figure a)
 Treatment with citrate (the functionalization group) was unable to reduce any of the aforementioned parameters (Supplementary Figure S3), confirming the observed effects solely due to the conjugated nanomaterial Cisplatin intoxication caused weight loss in mice (Figure 3f), suggestive of the systemic toxicity that frequently arises in individuals receiving this anticancer drug
 Animals treated with C-Mn3O4 NPs were capable of mitigating weight loss
 Next, we examined the external morphology of isolated kidneys from each group
 The kidneys from the cisplatin exposed group were deviated from the usual darkish brown to a pale brown color with a rough and uneven surface (Figure g)
 The kidney to body weight ratio (i

 ;    Hematoxylin and eosin-stained kidney sections of the control and C-Mn3O4 NP treated groups showed normal histologic features (Figure 3j & 3m) with negligible necrosis score (Figure i)
 The kidney sections from cisplatin intoxicated mice displayed several pathological features of CKD like focal segmental as well as global glomerulosclerosis along with interstitial fibrosis, diffused thickening of the capillary walls, glomerular hyalinosis, dilated or collapsed Bowmans space and glomerular retraction (Figure k)
 Tubular atrophy, dilation of cortical tubules, increased mesangial matrix, obliteration of features observed in this group
 Treatment with C-Mn3O4 NPs notably reduced focal dilation, mild mononuclear infiltration, and detachment of epithelial cells were observed in this group
 Overall, C-Mn3O4 NPs were able to efficiently revert the marked detrimental changes in the renal architecture of CKD animals
 The histological observations are quantitatively reflected in the necrosis score (Figure 3i), glomerular injury score (GIS; Previous studies and our histological observations suggested an association between renal fibrosis and CKD [-]
 So, we measured the renal hydroxyproline content, a byproduct of collagen metabolism and biochemical marker of fibrosis
 The results indicate almost a threefold increase in the hydroxyproline content (
 
07 compared to 
 
03 mg gm-1 tissue of control; p<

 In accordance with the histological findings, treatment with C-Mn3O4 NPs markedly reduced the hydroxyproline content (

 Therefore, we tried to ascertain whether C-Mn3O4 NPs contributed to including lipid peroxidation (in terms of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS), reduction in cellular GSH pool, and inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activity were estimated
 Exposure to cisplatin markedly increased the level of TBARS (Figure 4a) and oxidative glutathione along with a reduction in GSH concentration
 Furthermore, it inhibited the antioxidant actions of enzymes like SOD, CAT, and GPx (Figure b-d)

 ;    consensus with our cellular studies, C-Mn3O4 NPs rescued the detrimental pleiotropic Macrophage infiltration in the kidney and subsequent rise in the plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF- are well-known features of CKD [-]
 We found significant increases in plasma concentrations of TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 in cisplatin-induced animals (Figure e-g)
 Treatment with C-Mn3O4 NPs resulted in a notable decrease in the cytokine levels
 No difference was observed between the C-Mn3O4 Considering the inevitable role of mitochondria in the pathogenesis of CKD [26, 54-59] and results of our in cellulo observations that C-Mn3O4 NPs protects mitochondria from H2O2 induced oxidative damage, we assessed the role of mitoprotection in the therapeutic salient features of CKD [26, ]
 Our data clearly show that the mitochondria isolated from the cisplatin intoxicated group were more sensitive towards Ca2+ manifested into a sharp decrease in 540 nm absorbance (Figure a)
 Treatment with C-Mn3O4 NPs inhibited mPTP opening and maintained membrane integrity
 m and ATP content declined significantly as a result of cisplatin administration (Figure 5b & c)
 These were accompanied by an increase in cytochrome c oxidase activity (Figure 5d) and a reduction in dehydrogenase activity (Figure e)
 The alterations were upended by C-Mn3O4 NP treatment
 Thus cisplatin-induced renal damage triggered the opening of mPTP, the decline in m, and induction of mitochondrial swelling that resulted in the release of cytochrome c in the cytosol leading to apoptosis
 The ladder-like DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis, was evident in the case of cisplatin-treated diseased groups (Figure f)
 Whereas, treatment with C-Mn3O4 NPs notably protected the mitochondria, inhibited cell death and decreased the extent of DNA fragmentation

 ;    In this study, we determined whether C-Mn3O4 NPs could be used as a redox medicine to treat CKD, an important clinical question considering the high prevalence of the disease and the non-availability of effective medication
 CKD is defined as the progressive and irreversible loss of renal function characterized by reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased urinary albumin excretion (albuminuria), or both [42, 44, ]
 Our results present evidence that treatment with C-Mn3O4 NPs significantly improved renal mitochondrial dysfunction in response to the cisplatin toxicity
 Our cellular and animal studies further enlightened the role of unique mitoprotective as well as redox modulatory Mitochondria have long been recognized for their canonical roles in cellular respiration and energy production []
 Recently, they have emerged as the master regulator of a of cellular redox equilibrium, calcium homeostasis, inflammation, and cell death [-]
 Thus, mitochondria are poised to play a pivotal role in the functioning of the kidney, an organ with high energy demand, and rich in mitochondria, second only to the heart []
 Our findings that C-Mn3O4 NPs maintain cellular redox homeostasis through the prevention of mPTP opening and ATP depletion discloses a key redox-mediated therefore vulnerable to the oxidative distress due to mitochondrial damage [48, ]
 Cisplatin accrues in mitochondria and reduces the activity of all four respiratory complexes (IV) involved in the electron transport chain, thereby a surge in mitochondrial ROS formation takes place along with mPTP opening, membrane depolarization and impairment in ATP production, leading to cell death [68, ]
 The mitotoxic mechanism of cisplatin essentially mimics the pathogenesis of CKD, thus an efficient reversal of damage in this rodent model is supposed to reflect the possible effects of a compound in higher animals
 Data from our cellular as well as animal studies provide sufficient evidence that C-Mn3O4 NPs prevent mitochondrial ROS surge, prevent loss of membrane potential, dysfunction, cellular redox imbalance, and tubular or glomerular cell death

 ;    the markers of CKD like increased BUN, plasma creatinine, serum urea, and glomerular This study provides a piece of direct evidence that C-Mn3O4 NPs can scavenge ROS, particularly H2O2 the longest living one in the cellular milieu
 It also proves the ability of the NPs in the prevention of mPTP from opening and subsequently maintenance of mitochondrial structure and function
 However, it is not clear whether ROS scavenging protects mitochondria or mitochondrial integrity which results in ROS depletion
 Several studies showed that a compound with the sole property of free radical scavenging cannot be effective in the reversal of oxidative stress-related diseases in higher animals because the antioxidant property is not sustainable and the compound becomes inactive after one reaction [-]
 So, to mitigate the burst of ROS, the intracellular concentration required for a conventional antioxidant molecule is enormous and practically hard to achieve [-]
 Thus, to become an effective medicine a compound should have some additional mechanisms that will ensure the sustainable effect in the therapeutic regime
 Therefore, and the efficacy of C-Mn3O4 NPs in the treatment of multifaceted diseases like CKD, we propose that both the mechanisms (i
 e
, ROS scavenging and mitochondrial protection) The findings that C-Mn3O4 NPs can accelerate the revival of proximal tubule epithelium proliferation of a subset of sublethally damaged, yet surviving, proximal tubule cells contribute to the regenerative property of the kidney []
 The acceleration of this process is sufficient to confer nephroprotection [74, ]
 As revealed in our histological findings, the recovery rate of these cells in C-Mn3O4 NP treated cisplatin exposed animals is significantly faster and efficient than the auto-recovery
 Several mechanisms can be proposed for the enhanced proliferation by C-Mn3O4 NPs
 The restoration of structural and functional integrity of mitochondria and recovery of respiratory complexes may contribute towards the increased proliferation
 It is well known that the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) has a crucial role in cell proliferation through regulation of ATP generation, and supply of energy to proliferative pathways [76, ]
 Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations in ETC genes, or presence of ETC complex inhibitors causes a reduction in ATP synthesis obstructing progression through cell cycle leading to (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    a blockage in proliferation [-]
 Thus, the mitoprotective activity of C-Mn3O4 NPs may have played a significant role in the revival of tubulointerstitial epithelial cells, in turn protecting the renal architecture
 Additionally, ROS scavenging by C-Mn3O4 NPs may boost the proliferation because oxidative distress in proximal tubules causes cell cycle The role of intracellular redox regulation through mitoprotection in the therapeutic action of C-Mn3O4 NPs opens up further avenues for the treatment of several unmet diseases like multiple sclerosis), cardiovascular disorders, obesity, etc
 where pathogenesis is very much in our study C-Mn3O4 NPs did not show any adverse side effect, a detailed study on its in vivo behavior
 Furthermore, a detailed molecular study analyzing the genome and metabolome of C-Mn3O4 NP treated animals may enlighten its ability to interfere in other pathogenesis pathways

 ;    Mitochondrial function was evaluated by determining m using JC-1 (Sigma, MO, USA), ATP production (Abcam, Germany), and the activities of mitochondrial complexes succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase
 mPTP opening was measured in terms of mitochondrial swelling by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 540 nm after Total renal DNA was isolated following a standard procedure []
 DNA fragmentation was assessed using agarose gel electrophoresis
 In a typical procedure, renal DNA (
0 g) was loaded on 
5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide
 Electrophoresis was carried out for 2 h at 90 V, and the resultant gel was photographed under UV All numerical data are expressed as mean  standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise specified
 One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukeys post hoc multiple comparison test was implemented to compare various parameters between the groups (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
