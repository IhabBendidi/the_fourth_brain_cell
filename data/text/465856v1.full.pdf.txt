 ;    Children in low- and middle-income countries are frequently exposed to cumulative health and developmental risks often rooted in unhealthy environments []
 Nearly 3 billion people worldwide still use solid fuels for cooking, a major source of household air pollution (HAP) []
 HAP exposure drastically increment the risk of acute respiratory infections (ARI) [3], pneumonia [4] and other adverse outcomes such as cognitive deficits in children []
 Eleven percent of the world population still rely on unimproved drinking water sources and 36% on unsafe sanitation []
 Exposure to inadequate drinking water, sanitation and personal hygiene  increases the risk for diarrhoea [7] and malnutrition []
 Early child development (ECD) generates opportunities that shape childs lifelong health and developmental status []
 However, today two hundred million children worldwide are not developing their full cognitive potential []
 This disparity has lifetime adverse consequences and impacts Having access to safe drinking water (i
 e
 piped public taps) decreased school absenteeism []
 Effective household water treatments combined with safe storage provided protection against diarrhoea []
 Hand-washing with soap reduced diarrhoea by 40% []
 The use of improved cookstoves (ICS) lessened HAP exposure and improved health []
 ECD interventions enhanced health status [16] and development in children [16, ]
 The reduction of poor health and development requires integrated approaches addressing the underlying risks and structural determinants at the household level []
 Multiple studies demonstrated that low-cost interventions focused on various health risks factors simultaneously had a synergic effect and increased opportunities for a sustained use over time [17, ]
 Integrating ECD and home-hygiene interventions is promising, as they both target young children within their homes []
 The home-based approach enhances the effects of ECD interventions, which could also lead to improvements of childrens general health and affection, and mothers mental health [21, ]
 Furthermore, home-based interventions can help reducing the use of material and human resources, providing a more In this article, we describe the design and baseline results of a cluster-randomised controlled trial seeking to develop an integrated cost-effective home-based package of environmental not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    The trial was conducted in the San Marcos and Cajabamba provinces, Cajamarca region, Andean Peru
 We chose the locations based on the coverage of the national ECD programme (Programa Nacional Cuna Mas (PNCM)) and on-going relationships with local stakeholders who partook in a previous cluster-randomised controlled trial conducted in the region
 The results of our previous research endeavours enhanced the implementation of this new trial (IHIP-2 trial in the following) [17, ]
 Both sites are high altitude rural resource-limited locations with chronic malnutrition and illiteracy []
 The majority of the population are small-scale farmers living in 2-3 roomed houses with earthen floors and adobe walls, with We implemented a 2x2 factorial design trial applying two interventions individually and in combination: i) an environmental health package comprising a certified ICS, kitchen sink and hygiene education (IHIP); and ii) an early child development programme (ECD)
 This design led to four potential experimental conditions: i) IHIP & ECD (IHIP+ in the following), ii) IHIP, iii) ECD and iv) Control
 We chose this design because it randomises communities instead of We enrolled all families complying with the following inclusion criteria: i) had at least one child <
5 months living at the household; ii) used solid fuels as main energy source for cooking/heating; iii) had access to piped water in the yard; iv) did not have moving plans for the next 24 months; and iv) did not participate in the PNCM
 We calculated the sample size using the formula proposed by Hayes & Bennett for cluster-randomised trials [25], assuming three episodes of diarrhoea per child-year, a 25% reduction of the incidence compared to the control arm, and a coefficient of variation of 
 
 With 10 person-years of follow-up in each cluster, we calculated 16 clusters for the intervention and control arm to detect the anticipated reduction of incidence with a power of 80% at the 5% two-sided significance level
 To account for potential loss to follow-up, we included 40 clusters with an average of 
5 person-years of follow-up
 For the ECD intervention, we used the ECD outcome (percentage of tasks solved above the mean of the study population) of our previous intervention study [17] and assumed 60% above mean for the intervention and 40% above mean in the control arm
 Using the equivalent formula for proportions, we calculated that 15 clusters for intervention and control with ten children

 Participants were enrolled between September 2015 and January 
 If multiple eligible children were found in a household, we selected the youngest child
 We enrolled 82 eligible communities, which we aggregated into 40 community-clusters because of their partly close proximity to each other
 After the enrolment, we allocated the communities into the four study arms using a covariate-based constrained randomisation as proposed by Moulton []
 Based on geographic distance, we first divided the clusters into 8 strata of 4 clusters each and 1 stratum of 8 clusters
 We then generated two million random allocation sequences and selected those for which the maximum difference between arms was i)  5 in terms of number of villages; ii) 10 for the number of children; iii) median village size (number of households) 10; iv) median altitude 250; v) proportion of households with a health post in the community 10 %-points; vi) proportion of households with a school within the community 10 %-points; and vii) proportion of households living in villages having an electricity connection  10 %-points
 Of the 164 allocation sequences that Between May and July 2015, we consulted communities on their preference on three pre-selected ICS
 Forty-eight women were asked to cook with each ICS model for three consecutive days (9 in total)

 The PNCM was launched in 2012 to improve the cognitive, social and emotional development of infants <3 years of age living in poverty
 In addition, the programme sought to improve families knowledge and practices regarding caregiving, and strengthens the bond between mothers and children
 The PNCM provides a home-visiting intervention in rural areas (Acompaamiento a Familias (AAF)) as opposed to a day-care service in urban settings
 The AAF was implemented and evaluated in Mother facilitators (MF) were trained women living in the participating communities and caretakers) and the child
 MFs were selected using PNCM guidelines and received a one-day training session and monthly re-trainings
 MFs were supervised by a technical assistant team (TA), which mentored and assisted MFs in the planning of the weekly sessions according to the PNCM guidelines
 In addition, the TA team organised bi-monthly group sessions with participant mothers to share experiences, lessons or concerns of the ECD intervention
 The TA team received a one-week training from PNCM experts in planning and delivering of the ECD sessions
 All participating household received a set of age-specific toys to stimulate childs psychomotor and cognitive development every two months (six packages in total)
 abilities and to teach mothers plays and games for daily interactions
 We assessed childhood diarrhoea and ECD status as primary outcomes
 We defined diarrhoea according to the World Health Organization (WHO) standards, passing of at least three loose stools within 24 hours [29], and ECD outcomes as an age standardised mean The secondary outcomes included: i) ARI, defined as presence of cough and fever reported by the primary caretaker, according to the WHO standards [30]; ii) severe cases of diarrhoea defined as persistent diarrhoea for more than 14 days or bloody diarrhoea; iii) household and personal exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and particle matter (PM

 ECD compliance was defined as the total number of MFs visits and mothers satisfaction associated to the MFs visits
 We carried out active and passive surveillance to collect diarrhoea and ARI morbidity data during the 12-month follow-up
 The fieldworker team (FW) visited all households weekly and collected daily and weekly information from the mother or caretaker about the occurrence of signs and symptoms of child diarrhoea and ARI
 The FW was instructed to obtain two measurements of respiratory rates, which increased the specificity for a diagnosis without a loss of sensitivity []
 To define the severity of the disease, for diarrhoea we collected additional information on observed blood in the stools
 For ARI, we measured respiratory rate, heart rate and oxygen saturation in blood (SpO2) with portable pulse oximeters (PPOs) (Masimo iSpO2 Rx) and multisite reusable sensors (Masimo M-LNCS YI SpO2) connected to tablets (Lenovo TAB 2 A-)
 We used the lambdanative framework to provide a real-time diagnostics of ARI and its severity []
 Respiratory rate was recorded using the RRate app module []
 Severely ill children were referred to the local healthcare facility for further evaluation
 The FW received a five-day initial training for morbidity data collection with monthly re-training sessions of two hours
 All the surveillance devices and tools were tested on a daily-basis between February and April 
 In addition, the passive surveillance team (PS) collected health data from our study participants monthly at their local community-based health centres (22 in total)
 To ensure that they were also collecting SpO2 in each evaluation, we provided PPOs, sensors and tablets to local health centres
 During the visits, the PS also trained local health personnel on the maintenance and use of The environmental team (EV) collected household air pollution and drinking water samples

 At the laboratory, the samples were analysed for thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms using a membrane-filtration method from the Oxfam DelAgua water testing kit []
 All yellow colonies forming units were considered positive for E
coli growth
 These were then collected and placed in transportation vials media and send to Lima for further phenotypic and HAP data were obtained from the sentinel sub-sample five times (before and after ICS installation and three times during follow-up)
 Water samples were collected at the baseline and end of study for all study participants and in the sentinel sub-sample four additional To assess ECD status, the TA carried out an assessment using the nationally validated Peruvian Infant Development Scale (ESDI) tool [36] at baseline and end of study
 The TA received a one-week training from PNCM experts
 For evaluating ECD improvements, the TA also implemented the ESDI tool at end of study
 In parallel, a group of specialised psychologists conducted the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID) [37] Finally, the capacity building team (CBT) was responsible for re-training participants on hygiene, hand-washing, boiling practices and ICS maintenance
 The CBT conducted monthly reinforcement visits and collected data on the IHIP intervention condition
 A local ICS constructor was hired in case additional maintenance of the intervention was required

 Ten percent of all data collected in the trial was double entered to ensure data quality
 To reduce the possibility of courtesy bias, household data collection routes of FW were changed every two months
   From the screening census, we identified 102 communities with 574 potential children
 During enrolment we found that 237 families were no longer eligible because i) they participated in another social programme (N=167); ii) they did not fulfil the inclusion criteria (N=34), and iii) they rejected participation (N=)
 We re-enrolled between January and February 2016 because 28 children were not available or rejected to participate in the project at the beginning of the follow-up
 In total, 317 households in 10 clusters per arm drinking water quality and levels of ECD indicators for each participant
 We measured The four arms were balanced in most of the domains (Table )
 Mothers from the four arms were of similar mean age, had similar levels of primary education and years of schooling
 The majority of household had adobe walls, earthen floors, tiled roofs, and piped water system
 We observed differences among trial arms in the proportion of children below 1 year
 This imbalance disappears comparing IHIP versus no-IHIP or ECD versus no-ECD arms

 Imbalance was observed in the prevalence of stunting, with the highest proportion in the ECD arm (

 Two-week diarrhoea prevalence was balanced between arms, as were two-week prevalence of cough and fever
 However, we did observed differences between the health insurance coverage between arms, with the highest lack of coverage in the IHIP+ (
3%) and the lowest in the control arm (
 %)
 Vaccination coverage, varied between arms (Table )
 The highest complete doses of vaccines for children between 6-11 months were in the ECD, and the lowest in the control arm (%)
 These percentages change when we look at children between 12-24 months, where coverage levels in the ECD arm increase up to 70% and the four arms are balanced

 This trial uses a robust 2x2 factorial design that allows the assessment of two interventions in a single study without increasing sample size []
 For the ECD intervention, we implemented one component of the Perus national ECD The trial included 317 rural families living in 82 communities from two Peruvian provinces
 Baseline results indicate the trial arms are balanced with respect to most baseline characteristics, but given the limited number of clusters and the amount of characteristics presented, we also found a few imbalances
 Imbalances observed will be considered in the primary trial analysis comparing each intervention separately with its counterfactual, i

 ;    The use of active surveillance in this trial will maximize sensitivity while passive surveillance increases the likelihood that true cases will be diagnosed, increasing specificity []
 To synchronise ARI diagnosis with new national guidelines (stipulated by the MINSA) and address potential limitations of passive ARI surveillance, we equipped all the health centres in our working area with PPOs
 Both, health and project field staff were trained, monitored and supervised monthly in the use of PPOs to assess ARI cases equally
 PPOs have been underutilised in resource-limited health care settings for a variety of reasons, including high cost, inadequate supply and lack of training []
 Our design overcomes these limitations and enhances the research of the usefulness and effectiveness of PPOs for ARI case assessments
 In addition, PPOs show to be optimal tools for identifying children with hypoxemia, an indicator for severe respiratory diseases []
 Previous research indicated that the reference SpO2 thresholds for hypoxemia are lower at high altitudes in comparison to those at sea level []
 A median SpO2 hypoxemia threshold of 96% for children below 5 years living at 2500 m
 a
 s
l has been proposed []
 Our SpO2 results in healthy children living between 2250-3900 m
 a
 s
l are lower than the suggested threshold
 Hence, pondering specific SpO2 hypoxemia thresholds for children living in high altitudes becomes a challenge
 Our systematic health data collection using PPOs may further pave the way for assessing SpO2 hypoxemia threshold values at high altitude settings for children with and without Little attention has been paid to users perspectives and preferences in the design of ICS interventions in the past []
 We conducted a community consultation to select an ICS model that was both locally accepted and efficient
 According to recent evidence, those who participate in community consultations to select ICS models have a higher odd of increasing Our study has some limitations
 Because of the nature of the trial design, interventions could not be blinded
 The use of tablet-based technologies to measure pulse oximetry was a challenge for both, health centre and field staff
 We trained the health centre personnel on the correct use and benefits of introducing PPOs in their daily work in two group sessions
 However, due to frequent changes of health centres personnel, we had to retrain individually new staff on-site on a monthly basis
 Baseline ECD evaluation and the age-specific assessment tools were not as straight forward to apply as we had experienced previously []
 Despite the assertion from the PNCM programme experts that also novices could apply the ESDI tool, we found that the lack of familiarity and experience among the field staff consistently produced unusually high scores in all individuals (at baseline)
