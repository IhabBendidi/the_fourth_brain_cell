 ;    Pathogenic viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and HIV hijack the host molecular machinery to establish 27 infection and survival in infected cells
 This has led the scientific community to explore the 28 molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, establishes productive 29 infection, and causes life-threatening pathophysiology
 Very few targeted therapeutics for 30 COVID-19 currently exist, such as remdesivir
  Recently, a proteomic approach explored the 31 interactions of 26 of 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins with cellular targets in human cells and identified 32 67 interactions as potential targets for drug development
 Two of the critical targets, the 33 bromodomain and extra-terminal domain proteins (BETs): BRD2/BRD4 and mTOR, are 34 inhibited by the dual inhibitory small molecule SF2523 at nanomolar potency
 SF2523 is the 35 only known mTOR PI3K-/(BRD2/BRD4) inhibitor with potential to block two orthogonal 36 pathways necessary for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in human cells
 Our results demonstrate that 37 SF2523 effectively blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung bronchial epithelial cells in vitro, 38 showing an IC50 value of 
5 M, comparable to IC50 value of remdesivir (
1 M)
 Further, we 39 demonstrated that the combination of doses of SF2523 and remdesivir is highly synergistic: it 40 allows for the reduction of doses of SF2523 and remdesivir by 25-fold and 4-fold, respectively, 41 to achieve the same potency observed for a single inhibitor
 Because SF2523 inhibits two SARS-42 CoV-2 driven pathogenesis mechanisms involving BRD2/BRD4 and mTOR signaling, our data 43 suggest that SF2523 alone or in combination with remdesivir could be a novel and efficient 44 therapeutic strategy to block SARS-CoV-2 infection and hence be beneficial in preventing severe 45 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus named severe 50 acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ()
 This is a novel zoonotic single-51 stranded RNA virus that belongs to the betacoronavirus family, which also includes severe acute 52 coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ()
 The ongoing global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 was first reported 54 from Wuhan, China, in January 
 As of March 01, 2021, globally, more than 
30 million 55 confirmed cases and 
53 million deaths had been reported due to COVID-19 56 SARS-CoV-2 utilizes host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the primary receptor 58 for entry along with several other accessory factors that include TMPRSS2, neuropilin-1, 59 PIKFyve kinase, and CD147, among others (-)
 After internalization, cathepsin L cleaves the S 60 protein and aids in releasing the viral genome in the host cell cytoplasm ()
 Inside the cell, virus 61 utilizes the host cell machinery to replicate its positive-sense RNA genome and process the 62 polyproteins to generate functional structural and nonstructural proteins
 Then, the viral genome 63 and structural proteins are assembled into progeny viruses, travel to the plasma membrane and 64 are released utilizing lysosomal exocytosis pathways ()
 During this replication cycle, several 65 viral proteins like NSP1, NSP3, and ORF7a/b suppress the type 1 interferon (IFN) mediated host 66 immune response (10), while others activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that stimulate the release 67 of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, GCSF, IFN-, and TNF- ()
  68 The pathophysiology of COVID-19 follows a biphasic pattern
 In contrast, the initial acute phase 69 of infection is manifested by viral infection-driven symptoms including sore throat, fever, 70 fatigue, dry cough, and/or diarrhea ()

 ;    immunopathologic phase that includes the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome 72 (ARDS), systemic inflammation, and cytokine storm, which is responsible for multiple organ 73 failure and a higher rate of fatalities ()
 Patients with certain comorbid conditions like 74 (COPD) also have a higher probability of developing acute severe respiratory distress syndrome 76 (ARDS)
 Moreover, a subpopulation of patients develops neurological disease manifestations 77 like loss of taste and smell, dizziness, confusion, ataxia, seizures and Guillain-Barr Syndrome 78 (GBS) have also been reported ()
 Among the patients who develop ARDS, many of them 79 succumbed to the disease due to the development of pulmonary fibrosis ()
 These data suggest 80 that the addition of a currently available or upcoming anti-fibrotic agent for the management of 81 critically ill COVID-19 patients would be beneficial to reduce the rate of fatalities and long-term 82 Although some vaccine candidates received emergency use authorization (EUA) from U
 S
 Food 84 and Drug Administration (USFDA) to control the rapid spread of the virus, it is anticipated that it 85 will take several months to years to vaccinate the majority of the population ()
 Again the 86 long-term safety, efficacy, and durability of these vaccines remain unknown specifically for the 87 special populations that include children, pregnant women, individuals with comorbid 88 conditions that may impact immune response against a vaccine ()
 Along with that, 89 preliminary studies indicate that the emerging new strains of SARS-CoV-2 from South Africa 90 having Lys417Asn, Glu484Lys, and Asn501Tyr substitutions in the receptor-binding domain, 91 and Leu18Phe, Asp80Ala, Asp215Gly, 242244del, and Arg246Ile in the N-terminal domain of 92 spike protein have reduced susceptibility to neutralization by convalescent plasma therapy ()

 Therefore, other strategies to reduce SARS-96 CoV-2 and related mutant strain associated morbidity and mortality are urgently needed
  97 These factors underscore the urgent development of an effective therapeutic regimen that will 98 control the rapid spread of the virus and reduce the high rate of fatalities among severely ill 99 patients
 From the outset of this pandemic, multiple therapeutic strategies have been tested that 100 are at different stages of development and clinical trials with mixed responses ()
 The majority 101 of which includes SARS-CoV-2 fusion/entry inhibitors (19), RNA-dependent RNA polymerases 102 (RdRps) inhibitors (20), viral protease inhibitors (21), several classes of immune-suppressive 103 agents to control systemic hyperactive inflammatory response (22), and cytokine storm and 104 At present, remdesivir (GS-5734) is the only US FDA-approved antiviral agent in use to treat 106 COVID-19 ()
 It is a prodrug of a monophosphate nucleotide analog that selectively inhibits 107 controlled clinical trial reported shorter hospital stay for patients with COVID-19 when treated 109 another multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted by WHO did not find any superior effect 111 Therefore, in the absence of a fully effective drug in the prevention of COVID-19, it is warranted 113 to identify and validate more compounds that, individually or in combination with other 114 molecules, will have a profound antiviral efficacy against COVID-19 ()
  115 Recently, Gordon et al (29) used a proteomic approach to explore the interactions of 26 out of 116 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins with cellular targets in human cells and identified 67 potential 117 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 By molecular pathway analysis, they 118 demonstrated an interaction of BRD2/BRD4 with E protein of SARS-CoV-
 In another study 119 Tian et al using CRISPRi screening shown that BRD2 inhibition down regulate the ACE2 120 expression which block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 within host cells as well as control 121 hyperactive immune response in COVID-19 patients through down regulations of ISGs ()
 122 Therefore, they proposed BRD2 as a potential target for development of therapeutics against 123 SARS-CoV-
 Two of the critical host factors responsible for pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, the 124 bromodomain and extra-terminal domain proteins (BETs): BRD2/BRD4 and mTOR, are 125 inhibited by the dual inhibitory small molecule SF2523 developed by our group previously
 In 126 the present study our in vitro data using a human bronchial epithelial cell line (UNCN1T) shows 127 that SF2523 effectively blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication with IC50 values comparable to that of 128 remdesivir
 We also found that the combination of doses of SF2523 and remdesivir is highly 129 synergistic
  There is a 25-fold dose reduction for SF2523 and a 4-fold dose reduction for 130 remdesivir, respectively, when the two compounds are used in combination and they maintain 131 similar potency as a single compound
 Future studies in suitable animal models are needed to 132 establish the clinical efficacy of SF2523 alone or a fixed-dose combination of SF2523 and 133 In a recent study using proteomic analysis, Gordon et al (29) identified 67 host factors that 138 interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and represent potential drug development targets

 146 This study evaluates SF2523 and remdesivir (GS-5734) antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 148 in Vero-STAT1 knockout cells and UNCN1T cells
 STAT1 is a transcription factor essential for 149 interferon-mediated host-cell antiviral response
 The STAT1 knockout cells are highly 150 susceptible to viral infection due to the absence of cellular antiviral response and used as control 151 for robust viral infection in this study
 On the other hand, UNCN1T is a human bronchial 152 epithelial cell line and expected to demonstrate the in vivo pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in the 153 lung and serves as a good in vitro model for testing efficacy of antiviral compounds against 154 Both cell types were treated with SF2523 or remdesivir and their IC50 values were determined 24 156 hrs, and 48 hrs post-infection
 The replication kinetics were determined from the culture 157 supernatant of SARS-CoV-2 infected UNCN1T and Vero-STAT1 knockout cells in the presence 158 of increasing concentrations of SF2523 and remdesivir and are described in Fig
 2A and Fig
 2B, 159 respectively
  Both compounds show a substantial reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load 24 hrs 160 post-infection
 Based on SARS-CoV-2 viral loads 24 hrs post infection, SF2523 showed 161 potential antiviral activity and inhibited infection in UNCN1T cells with an IC50 of 
52 M and 162 remdesivir with an IC50 of

 SF2523 and remdesivir have an IC50 166 value of 
58 M and 
75 M in UNCN1T cells (Fig

22 M and 
76 M 167 After testing SF2523 and remdesivir separately, we evaluated a series of combinations of doses 170 of SF2523 and remdesivir with concentrations above and below the IC50 determined above
 In 171 UNCN1T cells at 24 hrs post-infection, we observed the best inhibitory dose combination
 An 172 IC50 value of 
62 M was observed for remdesivir when combined with 
1 M SF2523 (Fig

  Vice versa, we saw the inhibition of viral replication at a fixed remdesivir dose of

  The use of multiple drugs with a different 175 modes of action and synergistic effects is a standard for treatment of infectious diseases to 176 increase the overall efficacy of the therapy and reduce dosage of individual drugs  while also 177 reducing the toxicity level and the chances of development of drug resistance ()
  178 Based on mass action law and the classic model of enzyme-substrate inhibitor interactions, the 179 median-effect equation was proposed by Chou (32), which describes the dose-effect relationship 180 as (Fa/Fu) = (D/Dm)m or log(Fa/Fu) = mlog(D)  mlog(Dm)
 Where the slope (m) of the lines 181 signifies the shape (m = 1, >1, and <1 signify hyperbolic, sigmoidal, and flat sigmoidal dose-182 effect curves, respectively)
 Fa is defined as percentage inhibition of viral growth at dose D, and 183 Fu is the fraction that remains unaffected (i
 e
, Fu = 1 - Fa)
 The antilog of x-intercept, where 184 Fa/Fu = 1 or log(Fa/Fu) = 0, gives the Dm value
 [log(Dm)] signifies the potency of the drugs 185 (where Dm stands for median effective dose or IC50 concentration: The concentration required to 186 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 By extrapolating the median-effect equation for multiple drugs, 187 Chou and Talalay proposed the combination index (CI) theorem to quantify synergism and 188 antagonism between drug combinations ()
 Low CI values with increased Fa values indicate 189 superior compatibility and high synergism between drugs combination (based on Chou and 190 Talalay Combination Index Theorem, CI < 1, = 1, and >1 show synergism, additive effect, and 191 antagonism, respectively)
 A plot of CI values at different fraction affected (Fa) levels referred to 192 Using CompuSyn, we generated the Median-Effect plot (Chou plot) of remdesivir (red line), 194 SF2523 (blue line), and the fixed-dose combination of remdesivir and SF2523 (green line) for 195 SARS-CoV-2 infected UNCN1T cells 24 hrs post infection as described above (Fig
 A)
 196 Analysis of the Median-Effect, where the X-intercept of the lines indicates potency, shows that 197 the combination dose is more potent than the individual doses of the compounds
 In contrast, the 198 Chou-Talalay plot (Fig
 4B) indicates the synergistic effect of SF2523 and remdesivir

 Whereas Table 2 shows the CI values at ED50, ED75, ED90, and ED95 in VERO-219 STAT1 knockout and UNCN1T cells, which suggests a moderate to strong synergistic effect of 220 the drug combinations
 In Vero-STAT1 KO cells at Fa 
5, we obtained a dose reduction index 221 (DRI) of 
56 for SF2523 and 
35 for remdesivir, respectively (with Fa for combination 
452; 222 
617 for SF2523 and 
533 for remdesivir)
 On the other hand, in UNCN1T cells, we obtained a 223 dose reduction index (DRI) of 
33 for SF2523 and 
75 for remdesivir, respectively, (with Fa 224 for combination 
145; 
836 for SF2523 and 
272 for remdesivir)
 225 We note that remdesivir does not alter the potency of SF2523 and does not interfere with the 227 binding of SF2523 to BRD
 To confirm this interaction, we performed NMR titration 228 experiments using 15N-labeled BRD4 domains and showed that remdesivir is incapable of 229 binding to either BD1, BD2, or the ET domain of BRD4, as no significant chemical shift 230 perturbations were observed in 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra 231 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 However, the subsequent addition of SF2523 to the NMR samples of 232 BD1 and BD2 led to large resonance changes, indicating robust binding, and no binding of 233 Other than remdesivir, a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor (34), there are no 237 confirmed efficacious molecularly targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of COVID-
 238 Targeted therapies that exploit host-virus interaction are likely to be least impacted by the 239 emergence of mutated strains of SARS-CoV-2 and produce more robust, durable treatment 240 options
 Gordon et al identified two potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, including 241 BRD4 and mTOR kinase pathway ()
  Using an in vitro we show that SF2523 is as potent and 242 effective as remdesivir in blocking the SARS-CoV-2 cytotoxicity and infectivity at 243 concentrations that are achievable and efficacious in animal models ()
 SF2523 is highly 244 selective and the only known dual inhibitor of PI3K-/mTOR and BRD4 and is currently slated 245 for clinical development
 Hence, it is an excellent candidate for further development for systemic 246 and pulmonary delivery for treatment of COVID-
  Importantly, SF2523 and multiple analogs 247 are the product of extensive in silico molecular design to engineer chemotypes with dual or triple 248 inhibitory properties against well-chosen synthetic lethality targets like BRD4, PI3K, and mTOR 249 The ATP catalytic site of PI3K-a is driven by a critical hydrogen-bond interaction with the NH of 251 Val
 The successful interaction of SF2523 as a PI3K inhibitor was designed with this mode of 252 action where the oxygen atom of the morpholine group engages as a hydrogen-bond acceptor with 253 the required NH of Val
 For the docking against PI3K, we initially created a p110-PI3K-a 254 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    homology model using the crystal structure of human-derived PI3K-g (PDB ID: 1E7V) where the 255 human PI3K-a protein sequence was superimposed to the PI3K-g protein sequence
 The resulting 256 3D model of PI3K-a was subsequently used for docking of SF2523 where amino acids within a 257 10  radius at the ATP binding site were selected
 Successful docking of SF2523 was achieved 258 using FlexX, where the optimal bin36ding mode of SF2523 fulfills 2 pharmacophoric 259 requirements, namely, the spatial location of the carbonyl group of SF2523 and a hydrogen-bond 260 interaction between the morpholine group of SF2523 and Val851 ()
 261 BRD4 bromodomain 1 (BRD4-BD1) active site recognizes acetylated lysine residues in histones 262 via hydrogen-bond interaction with the NH of the conserved Asn140 residue
 This binding site is 263 a hydrophobic cavity that contains structurally conserved water molecules
 For the docking of 264 SF2523 against BDR4-BD1, a human-derived BDR4-BD1 crystal structure co-crystallized with 265 small-molecule BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 (PDB ID: 3MXF) was obtained and amino acids within a 6 266  radius of JQ1 were selected
 Using AutoDock Vina (40) and rDock (41), SF2523 was predicted 267 to bind, forming a hydrogen-bond interaction between the carbonyl group of SF2523 and the NH 268 of Asn140 and a conserved water molecule
 The morpholine group of SF2523 is oriented towards 269 the opening of the binding site (solvent-exposed)
 The subsequent successful crystallization of 270 SF2523 with BRD4-BD1 (PDB ID: 5U28) confirmed the predicted binding interaction of SF2523 271 and it also revealed that one of the oxygen atoms of the benzodioxane moiety of SF2523 engages 272 in 2 additional hydrogen-bond interactions with BRD4-BD1, one with GLN85 and one with 273 another conserved water molecule ()
 NMR data from our laboratory confirms interaction 274 between BRD4 BD1 and acetylated lysine with the C terminus of SARS-CoV-2 E protein

 ;    From previous experience, it was observed that in patients infected with SARS and MERS, the 278 viral load peaks only after a week of initial reporting of disease symptoms (43, )
 Whereas in 279 the case of SARS-CoV-2, similar to influenza, the viral load peaks along with the onset of 280 disease symptoms ()
 It was reported that for influenza patients with high viral load at the 281 beginning of disease symptoms, combinational antiviral therapy is more effective than 282 monotherapies (46, )
 This is mirrored during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, 283 where multiple combinational therapeutic approaches using several repurposed drugs show mild 284 to moderate efficacy in treating severely ill patients (-)
 To extend this combinational 285 therapeutic approach to treat COVID-19 patients in vitro, we tested combination treatment of 286 SF2523 and remdesivir as described above
 Our findings suggest that this drug combination is 287 highly synergistic in the human bronchial epithelial cell line with 25-fold dose reduction for 288 SF2523 and 4-fold dose reduction for remdesivir while maintaining similar therapeutic efficacy 289 of individual monotherapies
  This reduction in remdesivir dose is also expected to reduce the 290 high incidence of adverse effects related to remdesivir monotherapy (26, )
 291 To characterize the molecular basis for SF2523 mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication 292 and confirm the synergistic combination of this compound with remdesivir in vitro, we used 293 NMR to look at the capacity of these two chemotypes to interact with BRD4-BD1, BRD4-BD2, 294 and BRD4-ET domains
 Consistent with the substantial synergy noted with the two agents, 295 remdesivir did not bind to BRD4; however, SF2523 binds to both BD1 and BD2 but not the 296 extra-terminal (ET) domain of BRD4, supporting differential molecular pathways targeted by 297 these chemically distinct chemotypes
  BRD2/BRD4 are epigenetic factors whose two N-298 terminal bromodomains (BDs) bind with acetylated histones and regulate several proteins ()

 Data from emerging mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 strains indicates 304 presence of several variation in the C terminal domain E protein, that may impact its binding 305 with host protein PALS1with altered disease pathogenesis ()
 BRD2/BRD4 also has a 306 significant role in cell cycle regulation, inflammation, and inhibition of BRD4 by SF2523 307 enhances the innate and adaptive immune response ()
 Again, BRD4 drives the secretion of IL-308 6, CXCL8, and IL17A, which leads to the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 309 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ()
 This suggests that BET inhibitors may 310 disrupt the interaction between BRDs and E protein and will have a favorable outcome in 311 treating COVID-19 patients
 LARP1, a significant effector of the mTOR pathway, interacts with 312 nucleocapsid protein (N) ()
 LARP1 knockdown of inhibitors of mTOR inhibits MERS 313 replication and have an immunosuppressive function ()

 Campbell et al, reported that SF2523 locks HIV replication in human cells via 316 induction of autophagy ()
 Moreover, Joshi et al reported that SF2523 has a potential 317 immunostimulatory impact on innate and adaptive T-cell immunity ()
 Because SF2523 318 effectively targets two crucial elements of SARS-CoV-2 driven pathogenesis, BETs 319 BRD2/BRD4, and mTOR, and because of its immune activation activity, SF2523 can be a 320 potential therapeutic agent to control COVID-

 ;    Our initial efforts to screen the efficacy of SF2523 monotherapy and combinational therapy 323 against SARS-CoV-2 in the 2D-cellular model is an essential step for initial screening of drug 324 like compounds before initiation of pre-clinical studies and commonly used to explore the 325 molecular mechanism of action
 Our future studies will reveal their efficacy in pre-clinical 326 animal models of COVID-
 Its synergistic effect will result in a favorable shift in the plasma 327 Cmax/EC90 ratio
 Ongoing structural studies to elucidate the interaction of SF2523 with host 328 factors and viral targets will clarify mechanisms of efficacy, and potential resistance as the virus 329 continues to undergo mutagenesis and selection during the pandemic
 Considering the emerging 330 data on the life cycle and biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans and the rapid emergence 331 of mutant variants resistant to vaccine candidates, we suggest that a combinatorial approach 332 based on one small molecule which inhibits the interaction of multiple viral targets with host 333 factors necessary for viral pathogenesis will be required to control the mortality and morbidity 334 associated with the pandemic and the likely endemic phase of this disease globally
 335 In conclusion, our study demonstrates the in vitro efficacy of SF2523 as a monotherapy and in 337 combination with remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 infection
  Considering the marked 338 synergistic effect of these two molecules in a wide dose range in in vitro assays, we conclude 339 that, SF2523 alone or in combination with remdesivir represents a future therapeutic approach to 340 obviate the severe disease associated with the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-
