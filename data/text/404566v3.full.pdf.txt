 In addition, tadalafil improved the IPSS quality of life (QOL) score (2, 6-8, )
 Nevertheless, tadalafil did not enhance the maximum flow rate (MFR) nor reduce the post-void residual urine on Combinations of tadalafil and another type of drug for BPH were also IPSS-T, IPSS-S, IPSS-V, and IPSS-QOL were improved by a combination of Another effect of tadalafil is to improve erectile dysfunction (ED) as evaluated by IIEF  (2-5, 10, 16), observed regardless of the severity of concurrent LUTS/BPH ()

 Just after randomization, one cancer
 One patient stopped taking tadalafil after two weeks because of a necessitating bladder catheter indwelling after four weeks, and so they were excluded from the study
 One patient taking tadalafil felt palpitations, but continued medication
 Therefore, rates of adverse events were 
6% in the tadalafil group, but 0% in the tamsulosin group (p=

 In 2012, Yokoyama et al prospectively randomized 612 LUTS/BPH Asian patients into four groups, each of which was administered placebo, 
2 mg of tamsulosin once daily, 
5 mg of tadalafil once daily, or 5 mg of tadalafil once daily for 12 weeks ()
 They concluded that both tadalafil and tamsulosin reduced IPSS compared with the placebo
 However, they did not directly and statistically compare the two drugs for unknown reasons
 Judging from the data they showed, reductions in total IPSS, IPSS-V, and IPSS-QOL scores were greater in the tamsulosin group mainly in European countries into three groups, administered a placebo, 
4 mg of tamsulosin once daily, or 5 mg of tadalafil once daily for 12 weeks ()

 ;    is difficult to know whether this result is consistent with the studies done by Yokoyama or Oelke, because they did not directly compare between the two IPSS-Q7 were not detected by ANOVA, thus neither tadalafil nor tamsulosin had a significant influence on those factors
 The finding that tadalafil does not improve uroflowmetry parameters is in line with most previous reports, while the finding that tadalafil does not have significant effects on 24-h-FVC groups: 5 mg of tadalafil once daily and 4 mg of silodosin (an 1-blocker) twice daily for 8 weeks
 They showed that reductions in IPSS-T, IPSS-S, IPSS-QOL, and OABSS scores were more marked in the silodosin group than in the tadalafil group, while IPSS-V was comparable
 In addition, MFR tended to increase more with silodosin than tadalafil in their study
 Their results were essentially in line with those of this study
 1-Blockers may alleviate storage As previously reported, tadalafil had more favorable effects on ED compared with tamsulosin
 In this study, adverse events were slightly more frequent in well-tolerated in both groups
 Limitations of this study include the small number of patients from a few institutions and that it was an open-labeled trial  Therefore, weaker effects of either drug might have gone undetected
