 * address ABSTRACT:  Recent advances in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structural elucidation have receptors is, in part, dependent on their conformational mobility
 However, the relationship between receptor function and static structures determined via crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy is not always clear
 This study examines the contribution of peptide agonist conformational plasticity to activation of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), an important clinical target
 We employ variants of the peptides GLP-1 and exendin-4 to explore the interplay between helical propensity near the agonist N-terminus and the ability to bind to and activate the receptor
 Cryo-EM analysis of a complex involving an exendin-4 analogue, the GLP-1R and Gs protein revealed two receptor conformers with distinct modes of peptide-receptor engagement
 Our functional and structural data suggest that receptor conformational dynamics associated with flexibility of the peptide N-terminal activation domain may be a key determinant (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    These membrane-embedded proteins transmit information borne by extracellular molecules to the cell interior
  Signal transduction is mediated by agonist-facilitated conformational changes in the receptor that are sensed by intracellular transducers, such as G proteins and arrestins
1 Understanding mechanisms governing agonist activation of GPCRs is integral to interrogation of physiological processes controlled by these receptors and offers a basis for developing therapeutic structure, including ligand-induced changes in GPCR structure, and of interactions between GPCRs and intracellular partner proteins
2 Nevertheless, it is emerging that static structures determined via x-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) cannot always be extrapolated to understand receptor and transducer activation, which are inherently dynamic processes
3 Here we describe an integrated chemical, pharmacological and structural approach to elucidate mechanisms of signal transduction by the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), based on comparisons involving two natural agonists, GLP-1 and exendin-4, and rationally  The GLP-1R is a class B1 peptide hormone GPCR that plays a critical role in glucose metabolism, and synthetic agonists of this receptor are used to treat type 2 diabetes and associated comorbidities
4,5 The primary endogenous GLP-1R agonist is the fully processed peptide, GLP-6  Class B1 receptors feature a large extracellular domain (ECD) in addition to the between the C-terminal portion of the peptide and the ECD; the N-terminal portion of the agonist subsequently engages the TMD core, facilitating conformational changes that are registered by the G protein and other intracellular partners (Fig

 ;    when bound to class B1 receptor ECDs,10,11 but insights into the structure of the agonist N-termini embedded in receptor TMDs have emerged only recently
 For example, a co-crystal structure of the GLP-1R bound to a short GLP-1-derived agonist peptide and cryo-EM structures of this receptor complexed to a heterotrimeric G protein and bound to either the endogenous agonist, GLP-1, or a synthetic peptide, ExP5, have been reported
1215 In each case, -helical secondary structure extends to the TMD-engaged N-terminus of the bound peptide
 Comparable observations were reported for agonist peptides bound to several other class B1 GPCRs
1625 In contrast, structures of other class B1 GPCRs bound to calcitonin (CT),26 calcitonin gene related peptide loop secondary structure near the agonist N-terminus, followed by either a short (CT-family peptides) or extended -helix
 In each of these cases, helicity near the N-terminus is disfavored by sequence
 For CT, maxadilan, and CGRP, a disulfide linkage precludes helix propagation to the N-terminus, while for UCN1 and CRF the presence of proline residues near the N-terminus  The current work is predicated on previous suggestions that GLP-1 activity depends on adoption of a reverse turn near the peptide N-terminus, which raises the possibility that the N-terminal helical conformation in the cryo-EM structure of receptor-bound GLP-112 may not fully capture  structural requirements for signaling
 This consideration is important because efforts to engineer therapeutic GLP-1R agonists might target a conformation that binds tightly to the signal-propagating form of the receptor
 Evidence for an N-terminal reverse turn in GLP-1R agonists has emerged from NMR characterization of isolated peptides29,30 and modeling of peptide-receptor conserved helix-capping motif near the agonist N-terminus33 that would favor non-helical (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    conformations in the segment preceding the cap
 A survey of peptide-activated GPCRs led to speculation that turn-like structures might be a common motif among agonists34 and that N-terminal region flexibility may be important for class B1 peptide agonists
  Previous efforts to stabilize the proposed turn conformation near the GLP-1 N-terminus via side chain cross-linking produced mixed results
 In some contexts, such cross-linking provided potent agonists, but other cross-linking efforts caused sharp declines in potency
32,35 Molecular modeling suggested that -helical and -turn conformations near the N-terminus should be energetically comparable for these cross-linked peptides, and that agonist potency was better correlated with computationally predicted -helix propensity than with -turn propensity
35 The -turn hypothesis remains plausible, however, because of early studies with two diastereomeric Watanabe et al showed that the L-Ala diastereomer was nearly 100-fold less potent than GLP-1 itself in terms of stimulating insulin release from isolated rat pancreases, while the D-Ala diastereomer matched GLP-1 in potency
36 Gly is frequently found at the center of -turn-forming segments, and Gly residues in such turns often display backbone torsion angles that are unfavorable for L-amino acid residues
37,38 Gly10 of GLP-1 is highly conserved across species
39 The observations of Watanabe et al raise the possibility that signal transduction mediated by GLP-1 is promoted by the accessibility of a reverse turn centered on Gly10, rather than restriction to the -helical secondary structure observed via cryo-EM for this region of receptor-bound GLP-
40 Studies with peptide and protein model systems indicate that replacing Gly with L-Ala stabilizes a right-handed -helical conformation by up to 1 kcal/mol,4143 while replacing Gly with D-Ala (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    GLP-1R peptide agonists with D-Ala are more potent than those with L-Ala at the fourth position
 We re-examined36 the agonist activity of Gly10L-Ala and Gly10D-Ala variants of GLP-1(7-36)-NH2 (Fig
 1b, 1c) with HEK293 cells transiently expressing the GLP-1R and stably expressing the GloSensorTM protein for detection of cAMP
44  Stimulation of intracellular cAMP production is typically used to monitor GPCR-modulated activation of the stimulatory G protein, GS
 Both Ala-containing diastereomers matched GLP-1 in terms of the maximum level of cAMP production
 However, while the Gly10D-Ala analogue was indistinguishable from the native hormone in terms of potency (EC50), the Gly10L-Ala was ~24-fold less potent (Fig
 1c; Table )
 This behavior is qualitatively consistent with  earlier observations
36,45 We explored the generality of these observations by evaluating Ala-containing derivatives of exendin-4 (exenatide) (Fig
 1b), a potent GLP-1R agonist isolated from a lizard venom that is used to treat type 2 diabetes
46  Exendin-4 and GLP-1 are very similar over the first 11 residues, and Gly10 of GLP-1 corresponds to Gly4 of exendin-4 (Fig
 b)
 The Gly4D-Ala variant of exendin-4 was only slightly less potent than exendin-4 itself in terms of cAMP production, but the Gly4L-Ala variant was ~30-fold less potent, which parallels the trend among GLP-1 analogues (Fig
 1d; Table )
 These data support the conclusion that an ability to access non-helical conformations near the  GLP-1R agonist analogues with turn-promoting -amino acids are more active than those with helix-promoting -amino acids at the fourth position
 Non-traditional substitutions can yield GLP-1 analogues that show distinctive behavior and these might also provide insight into agonist conformation
4750 To this end, we explored a second set of substitutions at the key Gly residue in GLP-1 and exendin-
 This experimental design was based on previous comparisons of the conformations and biological activities of conventional peptides (comprised entirely of -(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    amino acid residues) with the properties of analogues in which at least one  residue was replaced with a -amino acid residue
 Mixed-backbone peptides containing up to 25-33%  residues can adopt an -helix-like secondary structure
51 The constrained  residue derived from trans-(S,S)--aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid ((S,S)-ACPC) is comparable to L-Ala in stabilizing a right-handed -helix-like conformation (Fig
 a)
52 We previously showed that GLP-1 analogues with multiple (S,S)-ACPC substitutions in the C-terminal region, which is -helical when bound to the ECD, display substantial agonist activity
53,54 In contrast, (R,R)-ACPC (Fig
 1a) destabilizes a right-handed -helix-like conformation by >1 kcal/mol relative to (S,S)-ACPC or L-Ala
52 As observed for D-Ala,55 (R,R)-ACPC can replace Gly to stabilize turn segments
56 These precedents led us to compare diastereomeric derivatives of GLP-1 and exendin-4 in which Gly10 or Gly4, respectively, was replaced by either (S,S)-ACPC or (R,R)-ACPC
  Although the steric bulk of the (CH2)3 side chain might diminish activity relative to the natural GLP-1R agonists, these replacements should test the hypothesis that GLP-1R agonist activity is higher for ligands that can access non-helical conformations near the N-terminus, compared to those that cannot
 This hypothesis predicts that the Gly(R,R)-ACPC analogue should be more active than the  The relative activities among ACPC-containing analogues of the two natural GLP-1R agonists were consistent with predictions of our hypothesis: the Gly10(R,R)-ACPC analogue of GLP-1 was ~9-fold more potent than the (S,S)-ACPC diastereomer, and the Gly4(R,R)-ACPC analogue of exendin-4 was ~5-fold more potent than the (S,S)-ACPC diastereomer in eliciting cAMP production (Fig
 1c, d)
 Moreover, both analogues containing (S,S)-ACPC had reduced maximum cAMP production compared to their diastereomers
 Nonetheless, in each case, even the more potent diastereomer was an inferior agonist relative to the all- prototype, by ~45-fold in the (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    GLP-1 series and ~220-fold in the exendin-4 series (Fig
 1c, 1d, Table )
  The patterns of relative activity among ACPC-containing analogues of GLP-1 and exendin-4 support the hypothesis that access to non-helical conformations near the agonist N-terminus is important for GLP-1R  Peptides with helix-promoting  residues at the fourth position show relatively high affinity among the modified analogues
 An agonists potency is influenced by both affinity for the receptor and the ability to shift the receptor into active conformations that transduce the signal via interaction with intracellular proteins
57 Agonist affinity for GPCRs has typically been measured via competition with a labelled probe ligand
58 We developed a competition assay based on detection of probe binding via bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)
 Key components for this assay were a version of human GLP-1R with the bright, bioluminescent protein NanoLuc (NLuc)59 fused to the N-terminus, and a GLP-1(7-36) derivative bearing a tetramethylrhodamine moiety linked to a lysine side chain at position 
 This assay can be Normalized IC50 values (relative to GLP-1) derived from this competition BRET assay, in intact cells at equilibrium, show that all four modifications at Gly10 of GLP-1 and all four modifications at Gly4 of exendin-4 cause substantial declines in affinity for the GLP-1R relative to the natural agonist
 Effects of the substitutions on affinity were distinct from the effects of the substitutions on peptide potency, with the modified analogues for each peptide displaying relatively similar affinities to each other, but vastly different potencies for cAMP production (Fig
 1e, 1f; Table )
 For example, the Gly10D-Ala analogue of GLP-1 is indistinguishable from GLP-1 itself in terms of EC50, but the analogue shows a ~35-fold diminution in affinity
 This D-Ala analogue is ~-(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    fold more potent than the L-Ala diastereomer but binds only ~3-fold more tightly to the GLP-1R the four GLP-1 analogues, Gly10(S,S)-ACPC is the least efficacious agonist but has highest affinity for the receptor
 This affinity pattern is qualitatively paralleled among the four exendin-4 variants
 We found that both (S,S)-ACPC-containing analogues could function as antagonists of derivative of exendin-4 proved to be an even more potent antagonist than exendin-(9-39), which is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia (Fig
 2a, Table S)
61  Exendin-(9-39) cannot activate the GLP-1R because this peptide lacks N-terminal residues that engage the TMD core
36 The superior antagonist activity of the Gly4(S,S)-ACPC derivative relative to exendin-(9-39) suggests that the N-terminus of the (S,S)-ACPC-containing peptide engages the TMD in a manner that is energetically favorable but ineffective for GLP-1R activation
 The relatively high affinity displayed by the Gly4(S,S)-ACPC derivative of exendin-4 for the GLP-1R suggests that stable receptor-ligand complexes occur when helical secondary structure extends to the ligand N-terminus, consistent with the consensus conformation of GLP-1R peptide agonists in recent crystal and cryo-EM structures
14,40 However, the potency data for stimulation of cAMP production collectively suggest that signal transduction via Gs is facilitated if the receptor-bound ligand retains flexibility and can access a non-helical conformation near the N-terminus
 Assays of recruitment of -arrestin-1 or -2 to the GLP-1R indicated a similar requirement for agonist N-terminal flexibility (Fig
 2b, 2c; Table S)
 Further support for the functional importance of non-helical conformations near the agonist N-terminus was obtained from a BRET-based assay that monitors receptor-mediated changes in G protein conformation

 ;    The Gly4D-Ala derivative of exendin-4 had similar potency to exendin-4 itself in inducing conformational changes in the heterotrimeric G protein, albeit with modestly lower maximal response, while the Gly4(S,S)-ACPC derivative of exendin-4 was markedly less potent (Fig
 2d,  A cryo-EM structure of Ex4-D-Ala bound to GLP-R/Gs
 To investigate the receptor-bound conformation of the potent exendin-4 analogue containing D-Ala in place of Gly4 (referred to below as Ex4-D-Ala), we undertook cryo-EM studies of the complex formed by this agonist with the GLP-R
63 We co-expressed the human GLP-1R, dominant negative Gs,in Trichoplusia ni cells
 Nanobody 35, excess peptide ligand (10 M), and apyrase were added to form a complex, which was solubilized in lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG)/cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHS) mixed-micelles as previously reported
15,65,66 This complex was purified by sequential anti-FLAG affinity and size exclusion chromatography in the presence of saturating ligand (
5 M) to yield a monophasic peak on SEC containing each of the components of the complex, which was confirmed in negative stain TEM (Fig
 SA-SE)
 Although we were also able to form a GLP-1R/G-protein complex with the Gly4(S,S)-ACPC analogue of exendin-4 (Fig
 S3F-S3J), yields were poor, and the sample was too heterogenous by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig
 S3G) and negative stain TEM (Fig
 S3J) to warrant imaging by cryo-EM
   The purified Ex4-D-Ala complex was vitrified, and single particles were imaged on a Titan Krios TEM
67 After 2D and 3D classification of particle images, a consensus map with a nominal global resolution of 
3  was resolved (Fig
 S4, SA)
 Despite some orientation bias (Fig
 S5C), high local resolution in the receptor core and G protein enabled modeling of most of the complex including the N-terminus of the peptide within the receptor core (Fig
 3a, 4b, 4c, Fig
 SE)
 The local resolution in the ECD was lower but allowed for fitting of the ECD backbone and modelling (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    of side chains in the peptide vicinity
 Poor resolution was observed for the Gs alpha-helical domain and for ICL3 (residues 59-204 and 338-340, respectively), so these segments were omitted The Ex4-D-Ala complex is very similar to our recently published high-resolution structure of GLP-1 bound to the human GLP-1R (Fig
 d)
12 Even though Ex4-D-Ala shares the same C-terminal residues as the G protein-biased agonist exendin P5 (ExP5),15,68 Ex4-D-Ala adopted a distinct position relative to the receptor from that displayed by ExP5 (Fig
 4f, S9C), and Ex-D-Ala induced an ECL1 conformation closer to that in the GLP-1-bound structure (Fig
 4e) than that in the ExP5-bound structure (Fig
 SD)
 In the consensus map, the agonist adopted an -helical conformation along its entire length, despite the presence of D-Ala near the N-terminus (Fig
 f)
 The D-Ala residue displayed right-handed helical  and  torsion angles of -61 and -50, respectively
 The methyl side chain of D-Ala is close to the side chains of two receptor residues, M

 ;    complex (Fig
 S5H) as compared to conformer 
 In addition to the ECD, ECL1 was omitted from the model for conformer 2 because of low resolution
  Conformer 2 had limited density in the TMD core that could be assigned to the agonist peptide
 This density was not sufficient to allow modeling of the ligand (Fig
 3c), suggesting high mobility of the peptide in this receptor conformation
  Comparison of conformers 1 and 2 revealed that the orthosteric pocket of conformer 2 is more open than that of conformer 1 (Fig
 4d, e)
 This structural difference arises from outward motion of the top of TM6 and TM7 in conformer 2 and a more profound kink in the TM6 helix (~100 vs
 71 for conformer 1 vs
 2), which together lead to a ~16  outward shift of ECL3 in conformer 2 relative to conformer 1 (Fig
 c-e)
 The position and local conformation of ECL3 in conformer 2 are more similar to ECL3 in the structures reported for the GLP-1R bound to the small molecules TT-OAD270 and CHU-12812, which do not contact this loop, than to ECL3 in the structure for the GLP-1R bound to GLP-112,40 or conformer 1 bound with Ex4-D-Ala (Fig
 S)
  The weak ligand density in the orthosteric pocket of conformer 2 occurs in a distinct location relative to the ligand bound to conformer 1 (Fig
 c)
 Ligand density associated with conformer 2 partially overlaps with the Phe6 and Leu10 side chains of Ex4-D-Ala in conformer 1 but does not appear to extend as deep into the TM core (Fig
 c)
 The largest section of continuous density in the orthosteric site of conformer 2 is close to receptor residues Y
47 and L
36, which suggests that these residues act as a hydrophobic anchor for the ligand
  Y
47 adopts a distinct rotamer in conformer 2 compared to conformer 
  The ligand density observed in conformer 2 is sterically incompatible with the location of TM1 in conformer 1, which presumably explains why TM1 of conformer 2 is shifted away from the TMD core relative to TM1 in conformer 1 (Fig
 4c, e)
  Weak, transient interactions of Ex4-D-Ala with the receptor core as observed in conformer 2 likely contribute to this states high ECD mobility

 ;    The backbone of TM5 is similar in both conformers, but the R
40 side chain adopts different rotamers
 R
40 is key for receptor activation,71,72 and its side chain projects into the orthosteric binding pocket of the TMD in conformer 
 Conversely, the R
40 side chain projects upwards towards the ECD in conformer 1 (Fig
 c)
 Overlaying the two conformers shows that the position of the R
40 side chain guanidinium group in conformer 2 clashes with the agonist N-terminus in conformer 1 (Fig
 c)
 Thus, unfavorable electrostatic and steric interactions would make it impossible for conformer 2 to accommodate the positioning and conformation of the agonist that is observed in conformer 
 Beyond the orthosteric site in the TMD, the agonist, and the ECD, the conformations of the two conformers are largely similar
  The data from 3D classification and the varying local resolution in each of the classes are suggestive of greater conformational dynamics of the GLP-1R when bound to the Ex4-D-Ala peptide relative to that seen with previously solved active, peptide-bound, GLP-1R complexes
12 To gain further insight into the dynamics of GLP-1R bound to Ex4-D-Ala, we performed 3D variability analysis in cryoSPARC
73 This analysis resolves modes of global motion as principal components, with output of the three major principal components
 cryoSPARC analysis identified the transition between conformer 1 and conformer 2 as the dominant principal component within the dataset (Video S-)
 The conformer 2-like state as determined by cryoSPARC again showed unresolved density for the ECD and within the orthosteric pocket
 We note that a conformer 2-like state was not previously observed for the GLP-1-bound receptor complex using the same method for 3D variability analysis
12  3D variability analysis also revealed a receptor rocking motion atop the G protein as the major conformational variance in the secondary and tertiary principal components (Video S-)

 ;    Because replacing Gly with D-Ala in a right-handed -helix involves an energetic penalty of up to 
5 kcal/mol,41 it seems surprising that the major structure we observe via cryo-EM shows the D-Ala residue of Ex4-D-Ala incorporated into the -helix
 It is possible that the D-Ala methyl side chain makes energetically favorable contacts with the receptor that compensate for -helix destabilization, enabling adoption of the extended N-terminal helix in the G protein-stabilized active state
  Nonetheless, the observation that the D-Ala variant binds with ~8-fold lower affinity to the GLP-1R relative to exendin-4 itself suggests that agonist activity is not determined solely We hypothesize that conformer 1 is required for G protein activation, and that adoption of this receptor conformation is favored under conditions used to form a stable complex that can be imaged (inclusion of dominant negative G protein and nanobody 35, apyrase treatment)
 However, high agonist efficacy might result not only from a propensity to stabilize conformer 1, but also from an ability to promote G protein turnover, which could be hindered if conformer 1 were too long-lived
 Dynamics of TMD engagement and release could impact the number of cycles of G protein activation that result from a single agonist-binding event
  In the case of Ex4-D-Ala, if the agonist can partially disengage from the TM core but retain other receptor contacts, then the receptor could release the activated G protein and be ready to activate a newly recruited G protein
 FRET studies of ligand binding and receptor conformation support the existence of partially and fully engaged ligand-bound states for the PTHR
76 Conformer 2 might represent a partially engaged state, which would presumably occur on the energy surface of the agonist-receptor complex at a position between the completely dissociated and fully bound peptide states (Fig
 e)

 ;    The plausibility of this hypothesis is indirectly supported by the observation that salmon calcitonin, a high-affinity agonist, displays slower G protein release kinetics, and thus lower efficacy, than human calcitonin, a lower-affinity agonist
62 These two agonists favor different G protein conformations at the CTR, as indicated by the lower BRET signal in the G protein conformational change assay for human relative to salmon calcitonin
62 Similarly, we observed that Ex4-D-Ala induced a lower maximal BRET signal relative to GLP-1 in a comparable assay The stability of a partially engaged state, the stability of the fully bound state (which is competent for G protein activation) and the height of the energy barrier separating these two states could all be affected by changes at Gly10 of GLP-1 or Gly4 of exendin-4 (Fig
 5), and changes in these factors might explain the variations in behavior observed among the set of peptides studied here
 We propose that the poor efficacy of the analogues containing (S,S)-ACPC arises because this residue stabilizes the helical conformation near the N-terminus, relative to the native Gly, and thereby raises the energy barrier between the partially engaged and fully engaged states
 Hindered exchange between the fully and partially engaged states might prevent the activation of multiple G proteins after a single agonist-receptor association event
 For the analogues containing D-Ala, on the other hand, disfavoring helicity near the N-terminus might lower the barrier for interconversion between the partially and fully engaged states, and thereby enhance the likelihood that multiple G protein activation cycles would be triggered by a single agonist-receptor association
 In this case, the diminished affinities of the D-Ala analogues relative to the natural agonists could be compensated by an increase in average number of G proteins activated to cause the observed similarity in receptor activation efficacies of the D-Ala analogues relative to GLP-1 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    We cannot rule out the possibility that either of our cryo-EM-derived conformers, alone, represents the signal-transducing form of the agonist-receptor complex, and that the other conformer lacks functional significance
 The alternative hypothesis offered above, however, is consistent with previous studies that support a role for ligand mobility in activation of other GPCRs
 Dynorphin, a short opioid peptide, retains disorder when bound to the kappa opioid receptor,77 and mobility of neurotensin residue Tyr-11 is required for activation of the cognate receptor
78  Receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) also alter the conformational dynamics of the adrenomedullin receptors to effect changes in receptor phenotype
74 Our findings are distinct from these precedents, however, in suggesting that at least two distinct states of an agonist-receptor complex may play important and complementary roles in the signal transduction mechanism
  Collectively, the data reported here suggest that interconversion among distinct agonist-receptor conformations is critical to the efficacy of signal-transduction via the GLP-R
 This conclusion is consistent with emerging evidence that conformational mobility in agonist and receptor can be functionally important in signal-transducing states of other GPCR-peptide complexes
25,77,78 The mode of agonist mobility highlighted in this work may be evolutionarily conserved among peptide agonists of related Class B1 GPCRs; Gly at the fourth position from the N-terminus is found in glucagon, GLP-2 and several other hormones
33 Other sites of essential mobility may be present in more distantly related hormones
 For example, both parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone related protein have Gly at position 12, and early work suggested that PTH activity is retained when Gly12 is replaced by either D-Ala or L-Ala
79 Understanding the role of structural dynamics in the propagation of molecular information across the cell membrane is important in terms of elucidating GPCR function and developing improved therapeutic agents
