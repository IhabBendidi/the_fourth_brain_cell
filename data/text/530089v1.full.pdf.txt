 ;    Rice bran supplementation provides nutrients, prebiotics and phytochemicals that enhance 80 gut immunity, reduce enteric pathogens in mice and diarrhea in neonatal pigs, and 81 warranted attention for improvement of environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) in 82 children at risk
 EED is a condition that drives childhood stunting via intestinal dysbiosis 83 and impaired nutrient metabolism
 This study investigated effects of rice bran 84 supplementation on growth, EED biomarkers, gut microbiome and metabolome in weaning 85 infants from 6 to 12 months old in Nicaragua and Mali
 Healthy infants were randomized to 86 a control group or rice bran group that received daily supplementation at increasing doses 87 each month
 Stool microbiomes were characterized using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing
 88 tandem mass-spectrometry
 Statistical comparisons were completed at 6, 8, and 12 months 90 of age
 Daily consumption of rice bran was safe and feasible for infant growth, decreasing 91 alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, and modulating gut microbiome and metabolome when 92 compared to control
 Rice bran merits investigation as a practical intervention strategy that 93 could decrease EED prevalence and risk for children from low- and middle-income 94 countries where rice is grown as a staple food, and bran is used as animal feed or wasted

 ;    The prevalence of malnutrition in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) has 102 negative consequences on growth of children during the first five years of life and has 103 lifelong health consequences ,
 There is an increased risk of death among children under 5 104 years of age due to underweight, stunting, or wasting conditions ,
 Risk factors for 105 undernutrition may include, but are not limited to: low birth weight, inadequate 106 diseases are also some of the primary causes of undernutrition in children under five years 108 Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is an acquired subclinical condition of the 110 small intestine among LMIC children -
 Chronic exposure to enteric pathogens early in 111 life is one likely contributor to EED 
 The altered gastrointestinal functions in EED 112 include intestinal nutrient malabsorption and increased intestinal permeability that leads to 113 protein loss ,
 Infant weaning has been identified as a critical window for intervention 
 114 Previous intervention efforts in young children have targeted micronutrient deficiencies, 115 such as Vitamin A, Zn and Fe 13-16, oral rehydration salts for treating diarrhea 17, 116 antimicrobial use 18,19, and community hygiene improvements 
    117 Rice bran is a nutrient dense food with bioactive phytochemicals shown to prevent 118 enteric pathogens and diarrheal disease in mice and pigs 21-24, and favorably promotes gut 119 health in adults ,

 Rice bran merits attention because it is 122 widely available for consumption globally 30, and particularly in LMIC regions where EED 123 Stool EED biomarkers, gut microbiome 32 and metabolome analysis 15,33 became 125 important surrogate markers for analysis as intestinal tissue from infants is not easily 126 accessible to evaluate
  Stool myeloperoxidase (MPO) 34, calprotectin (CAL) 35, and 127 neopterin (NEO) 36 are indicators of inflammation; and alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) 34 is an 128 indicator of barrier lumen disruption
 Chronic, elevated concentrations of all four 129 biomarkers have been associated with poor linear growth in infants up to 24 months old 130 10,34-36, and as the gut microbiome is maturing over the first 3 years of life ,
 Gut 131 microbiome composition and metabolism is influenced by delivery mode, environment, and 132 nutrition ,
 Recent studies have demonstrated that malnutrition and immature 133 microbiomes of infants are only partially, and temporarily improved by some nutritional 134 interventions ,
 The nutritional composition and metabolic profile of rice bran, which 135 comprises a large suite of bioactive molecules, showed benefits in animal studies that 136 provided important rationale for investigation of dietary feasibility in weaning infants and 137 The major objective of this study was to investigate effects of dietary rice bran 139 supplementation during infant weaning on growth, EED biomarkers, gut microbiome and 140 metabolome from six to twelve months of age in Nicaragua and Mali
 The findings support 141 that daily consumption of rice bran for six months is tolerable, safe and feasible for children 142 during weaning and was associated with improved growth and decreased gut permeability 143 via favorable modulation of the gut microbiome and metabolome

 To study the effect of daily rice bran supplementation 149 on the gut, monthly stool samples from 47 Nicaraguan and 48 Malian children were 150 collected (average of 7 samples per child, total of 567 samples)
 The flow and number of 151 infants from study recruitment to study completion is shown in Fig
 
 Baseline participant 152 characteristics for Nicaragua and Mali are shown in Table 
 We collected information on 153 demographic factors and infants household characteristics
  In Nicaragua, 
2% of infants 154 were born via caesarean section in the control group and 
4% in the rice bran group
 All 155 participants from Mali were delivered vaginally
 For breastfeeding status, 96% of the 156 control group and 83% in the rice bran group were consuming breast milk at six months old 157 in Nicaragua and all children in the Mali group were consuming breast milk at the 158 beginning and throughout the study
 Of the 95 infants enrolled, 52 received antibiotics with 159 87 total antibiotic courses in the six-month period
 Most courses consisted of systemic 160 antibiotics given orally, with some delivered by injection for respiratory, skin, ear or 161 Dietary compliance to rice bran was averaged per month during the 6-month 163 intervention with no adverse events related to rice bran intake at the increasing doses over 164 time
 Compliance to the rice bran intervention in Nicaragua was 90% and in Mali was > 165 %
 The feasibility and tolerability for infants to consume rice bran at increasing doses (1-166 5g/day) over the six month study period was demonstrated when mothers fed rice bran 167 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 169  Anthropometric data was collected using standardized procedures across study sites 171 at 6, 8, and 12 months of age for each child and included length-for-age Z-score (LAZ), 172 weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ) and weight-for-length Z-score (WLZ)
 Table 2 reports the 173 z-scores analyzed by repeated measures and adjusted by treatment (rice bran) and age (6-8 174 months and 8-12 months) by country
 Significant differences were observed for 175 anthropometric measures between treatment, and ages in both cohorts
 In Nicaraguan 176 infants consuming rice bran, LAZ was significant over time (

    193 Rice bran modulates gut microbial communities in Nicaraguan and Malian infants 194 The microbiome was characterized and compared for 48 Malian and 47 Nicaraguan 195 infants at 8 and 12 months of age in the rice bran and control study groups
 DNA was 196 isolated from stool samples and the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was 197 sequenced utilizing the Earth Microbiome Project protocol -
 Sequences were 198 preprocessed for quality assurance and classified into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) 199 (see materials and methods), and the results were integrated to construct family and genus-200 level composition profiles for all 192 samples from both countries
 No major differences 201 were detected in alpha diversity indices (Observed, Shannon, InvSimpson and Richness) 202 calculated for rice bran group and control group at 8 and 12 months (Table S)
 Beta 203 diversity analysis, depicted in the Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) plot based 204 on the Bray-Curtis distance measure, indicated complete country-level separation in the 205 overall gut microbial community composition (Fig
 A)
 This provided rationale for 206 separating analyses for the microbiome and metabolite profiles by country
 207 Fig
 3B shows the NMDS plot separated by country
 This figure highlights 208 differences in the microbiome between two time periods, 8 and 12 months, which is more 209 pronounced in the Malian samples
 These figures show overlap of microbiomes within each 210 time period indicating putative similarity between the microbial community structures 211 during growth periods
 This overlap was observed to a greater level at 8 months of age as 212 compared to 12 months that may illustrate microbial adaptation to new exposures

 These taxa were ordered 215 based on significance, measured by the FDR-adjusted p-value, from bottom (most 216 significant) to top (details are provided in Table S2 for Nicaragua and Table S3 for Mali)
  217 Given the measurable differences in growth between groups by 8 months of age, the effect 218 of daily dietary supplementation of rice bran on the infant microbiome was compared to the 219 In Nicaragua, we identified 145 OTUs that were significantly different between 221 control and rice bran across the samples (Table S2), 74 of which showed greater than or 222 equal to 2 log fold differences between rice bran and control groups at 8 or 12 months (Fig

 Seven of these 74 OTUs overlapped between the ages 8 and 224 12 months
 In Mali, 42 bacterial OTUs were identified to significantly differ between 225 control and rice bran across samples, and 19 showed more than 2 log fold changes between 226 rice bran and control at 8 or 12 months (Fig

 ANOVA contrasts and Welchs two-sample t-test were used to identify 269 biochemicals that differed significantly between experimental groups at the 8-month time 270 point
 Stool metabolite analysis of children at 8 months of age in Nicaraguan and Malian 271 infants resulted in the detection of 1449 biochemicals, of which 1016 metabolites had 272 confirmed names and 433 compounds were of unknown structural identity (see Table S)

 ;    This study demonstrated that rice bran supplementation was feasible, well tolerated, 304 and safe for weaning infants with strong compliance to daily dietary intake in both LMIC 305 countries
 Rice bran supplementation in the diet supported growth of Nicaraguan and 306 Malian infants with differences detected between groups by 8 months of age and improved 307 gut permeability at 12 months
 Nicaraguan infants fed rice bran had increased LAZ 308 compared to the control, and in Mali, there was increased WAZ
  Based on documented 309 country-wide averages using the WHO scoring index 12, the 95 healthy infants enrolled in 310 this study had slightly higher WAZ, LAZ and WLZ scores
    311 There is a growing body of scientific evidence for a strong relationship between 312 EED and growth deficits in children ,,
 EED biomarkers were selected in this study 313 because high concentrations of stool AAT and MPO were associated with decreased growth 314 in children 47, and Naylor et al found that elevated AAT levels were associated with 315 decreased oral rotavirus vaccine response 
 Rice bran was shown to reduce AAT in 316 neonatal pigs challenged with human Rotavirus infection 22 and is of translational 317 importance herein as rice bran intake improved AAT levels in Nicaraguan infants (Table 318 )
 The lack of significant differences in levels of EED biomarkers for Mali may be due to 319 the higher number of overall diarrheal episodes, the level of variability within individuals, 320 and breastfeeding over time and across groups, yet these findings did concur with 321 concentrations reported in the MAL-ED cohort 
 EED biomarkers merit continuous 322 review for relevance with growth outcomes due to extensive global variability in 323 A study limitation and possible confounder of rice bran modulation to infant gut 325 measures was that the percentage of exclusively breastfed infants was lower and delivery 326 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    mode varied in the Nicaragua cohort (<50%) between groups, which was in contrast to the 327 Mali site that had 100% of children that were breastfed and had vaginal delivery
 These are 328 key considerations to evaluating microbiomes of children with EED that have been 329 characterized as less mature 52, and with varied structure by geographical location 53, diet 330 deficiencies 54-58, environmental exposures 53,59,60 and host factors ,
 Thus, we did expect 331 changes in both the stool microbiome and metabolome that occurred over time with growth, 332 and notably the microbial taxa and metabolites associated with the improved growth in rice 333 bran groups also differed at 8 months in both countries
   334 Given that dietary rice bran intake has been previously shown to promote beneficial 335 stool microbial communities, such as native gut probiotics in mice 23,62, pigs 21,22,29 and 336 adults 25,63,64, we first evaluated significant genus level taxa differences between rice bran 337 and control fed infants at 8 months and 12 months of age from both countries
 In 338 Veillonella were identified as responsive following rice bran consumption compared to an 340 age and control matched group
 These taxa have recognized saccharolytic mechanisms of 341 action 65-67, are known to produce and promote crossfeeding of short chain fatty acids 68,69, 342 as well as provide competitive inhibition of pathogen colonization ,
  The microbial 343 enrichment of these communities as associated with infant growth outcomes has 344 implications for assessing how gut microbes metabolize rice bran components
 In Mali, the 345 increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus in rice bran fed infants is also highly 346 consistent with prior studies in young animals, and should be considered alongside 347 evidence that human milk oligosaccharides also promote Lactobacillus in breastfed infants 348 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Stool metabolites from infants fed rice bran showed significant fold differences 350 amongst several essential amino acids, cofactors and vitamins, lipids, phytochemicals, and 351 in energy metabolism pathways compared to the control groups
 Stool metabolites 352 originating from rice bran were identified in both Nicaragua and Malian infants, providing 353 additional confirmation of compliance to the dietary intervention 
  As predicted, we 354 observed and reported exceptionally distinct profiles for both the stool microbiome and 355 metabolome composition of infants between Mali and Nicaragua at all ages 40,53,74 and 356 therefore separately discussed the response to rice bran supplementation by region
  For 357 example, the nearly 5-fold increased stool detection of indolepropionate in rice bran infants 358 compared to control from Nicaragua represents a tryptophan metabolite produced by the 359 gut microbiota that may influence the developing immune system and intestinal 360 equal to L-methionine) and N-formylmethionine in Malian infants also represented rice 362 bran derived amino acids required for normal growth and development 
  There are several 363 cofactors and vitamins from rice bran supplementation, such as alpha and gamma-364 tocotrienol and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) that merit attention for demonstrating multiple 365 health benefits such as synthesis of amino acids and neurotransmitter precursors, as well as 366 preventing anemia and skin problems ,,
 Additional microbial digested food 367 components in the stool metabolome that come from rice bran were ferulic acid 4-sulfate, 368 indoleacetylaspartate, and Tyrosol
  A study limitation is that we had only supplemented for 369 a 6 month window and according to WHO, growth assessment should be standardized and 370 compared globally over the first two years of life 80,81

 373 Furthermore, the increased separation noted between 8 and 12 months in this study 374 showed modifications in gut microbial communities and metabolites by rice bran intake, 375 and suggests there will be long-term impact on the overall microbiome composition as it 376 continues to develop and mature 
 The overall dietary pattern differences between mothers 377 and infants weaning practices in each country were also considered a major source of 378 variation as dietary diversity of gut microbe-food interactions were clearly observed in the 379 stool metabolite profiling (see Table S)
 Nevertheless, rice bran consumption was well 380 tolerated at increasing dose supplementation amounts during the first 6 months of weaning 381 This was the first randomized controlled trial of rice bran supplementation in LMIC 383 infants and provides compelling rationale for continued follow-up investigation of rice bran 384 supplementation for reducing risk of malnutrition, as well as for eliciting changes during 385 child growth that protect against enteric pathogens and diarrhea
 The dose and feasibility 386 outcomes from this study support development of rice bran based complementary weaning 387 foods
 Our findings also suggest that double blinded-controlled trial study designs with 388 larger infant cohorts are warranted for long-term outcomes to be assessed until five years of 389 age
 Incorporating rice bran from local rice production and processing facilities should be a 390 priority in subsequent trial designs, and with the goal of supporting the development of 391 sustainable and affordable food products for weaning infants, particularly those residing in 392 in LMIC where food and nutritional security remain

  These boxes were stored in a cool, 444 dark, dry place until they were provided to study participants
 445  The study team (doctor, nurse and study coordinator) in Nicaragua and the 447 community health workers (CHWs) in Mali provided a 2-week supply of rice bran at each 448 routine home visit and instructed the participants parent or guardian to add the daily 449 amount of rice bran to the participants food
  At 6-7 months of age, participants in the rice 450 bran group consumed 1g of rice bran/day (1 sachet)
  Between the ages of 7-8 months, 451 participants consumed 2g of rice bran/day (2 sachets)
  At 8-10 months of age, participants 452 consumed 3g of rice bran/day (3 sachets)
 The amount increased to 4g of rice bran/day (4 453 sachets) from 10-11 months, and 5g of rice bran/day (5 sachets) from 11-12 months of age, 454 respectively
 The rice bran was added to appropriate weaning foods, such as rice cereal, 455 yogurt, fruit and natural juices, vegetables, and soups
  At the beginning of the intervention 456 (six months of age), infants parents or guardians were instructed and monitored daily for 457 one week by study personnel to ensure that guardians knew how to administer and record 458 the amount of rice bran consumed
 Compliance to the rice bran intervention was calculated 459 from records that had the dose/amount of rice bran consumed circled in daily increments of 460 none (0%), half (50%), or all (%)
  The study team also collected any unused boxes or 461 sachets during these visits
