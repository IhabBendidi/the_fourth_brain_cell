, maintenance of physiological level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for mediating normal cellular functions (oxidative eustress) while evading the excess ROS stress (distress) is central to the concept of redox medicine
 In this functions have the potential to be the choice of redox therapeutics
 However, it is always challenging to estimate whether ROS-induced intracellular events are beneficial or deleterious to the cell
 Here, we propose the concept of redox buffering capacity as a therapeutic index of engineered nanomaterials
 As a steady redox state is maintained for normal functioning cells, we hypothesize that the ability of a nanomaterial to preserve this homeostatic condition will dictate its therapeutic efficacy
 Additionally, the redox buffering capacity is expected to trimanganese tetroxide nanoparticles (C-Mn3O4 NPs) as a model nanosystem we explored its redox buffering capacity in erythrocytes
 Furthermore, we went on to study the chronic toxic effect (if any) of this nanomaterial in animal model in order to co-relate with the experimentally estimated redox buffering capacity
 This study could function as a framework for assessing the capability of a nanomaterial as redox medicine (whether maintains eustress or damages by creating distress), thus orienting its application and safety for clinical use

 ;    Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and associated oxidative stress (so-called) remains the most fascinating paradigm for elucidating the adverse effects of engineered nanomaterials at cellular and molecular level []
 ROS generating nanomaterials are generally considered cytotoxic for biomedical use, and their therapeutic applications are restricted to anticancer or anti-microbial activities [-]
 Indeed, elevated ROS levels have the capacity to oxidize unsaturated fatty acids in lipids, and amino acids in proteins, inducing irreversible damage to vital organelles, and DNA, ultimately leading to cell apoptosis, and necrosis resulting in [-]
 However, recent understandings in free radical biology illustrate the pivotal role of ROS (at low concentration) as second messengers to modulate essential cellular functions like signaling, adhesion, migration, proliferation and homeostasis []
 This inherent duality of ROS, the purposeful beneficial functions at physiological level (i
 e
, oxidative eustress), as highlights the importance of maintaining proper redox balance for healthy organismal functions, and leads to the concept of redox medicine [9, ]
 Redox medicine epitomize a promising tool for restoration of cell and tissue homeostasis via direct detoxification of pathways []
 In this sense, an interesting  (perhaps the most important) avenue in redox medicine is the maintenance of oxidative eustress to regulate redox signaling and associated cell functions in addition to modulation of oxidative distress (i
 e
, inhibition to counteract pathological cell loss and induction to promote cell death of pathological cells)
 The disappointing history of efforts to prevent, or treat diseases with exogenous antioxidants (e
 g
, vitamin c, ascorbic acid, polyphenols etc
) further reflect the importance of redox-based In this new front of redox medicine, ROS-based nanomedicines that involve nanomaterials with ROS-regulating properties, holds promise for optimized therapeutic efficacies []
 Recent advancement in controlled synthesis process resulted into a wave of multifunctional nanomaterials with unique ROS generation, transition, or depletion functions
 However, for in vivo application, it is a double-edged sword

 ;    the elevated ROS level may also impair adjacent normal tissues []
 Moreover, if the nanomaterials are not degraded or excreted, their ROS-generating functions may still exist that may result in sustained oxidative damage
 Therefore, balancing the therapeutic outcome and side effect of ROS generating nanomaterials is important for the optimization of therapeutic effects, which needs more careful characterization of the in vivo behavior of ROS and more exhaustive safety assessment of the nanomaterials []
 In other words, information about ROS-mediated changes in cellular redox state, or ability of a nanomaterial to maintain eustress condition could be instrumental in dictating the therapeutic potential of a Unfortunately, the quantitative basis of changes in the intracellular redox state of the cells is not well-defined, thus leading to the dilemma that redox changes induced by oxidants in distinct cells types cannot be predicted []
 The current state of the art measurement methods for estimating changes in cellular redox state is by measuring the concentration variation of Nernst equation, which is grossly misleading as spatial-temporal control exists between redox couples, and information about single couple cannot reflect the actual redox status [-]
 In this study, we introduce the concept of redox buffering capacity as a therapeutic index of engineered nanomaterials
 As a steady redox state is maintained for normal functioning cells, we hypothesize that the ability of a nanomaterial to preserve this homeostatic condition will dictate its therapeutic efficacy
 Additionally, the redox buffering capacity is expected to trimanganese tetroxide nanoparticles (C-Mn3O4 NPs) as a model nanosystem we explored its redox buffering capacity in erythrocytes
 In this regard it is worth mentioning that, C-Mn3O4 NPs has previously been well studied from our group and showed therapeutic efficacy using both ROS generation and ROS scavenging abilities in in vitro as well as in vivo models
 It treats hyperbilirubinemia by oxidative breakdown of bilirubin inside the body
 On the other hand, it can mimic glutathione peroxidase to scavenge ROS and treat several diseases including hepatic fibrosis, heavy metal toxicity and Huntingtons disorder
 Thus, it is of considerable interest to assess the redox modulatory properties of this multifunctional nanoparticle

 ;    In the present study we used ~10 nm nearly spherical C-Mn3O4 NPs having monomodal size distribution (Figure )
 The optical properties of the nanoparticles have been thoroughly investigated and described by us in previous studies [15, ]
 The nanoparticle has the unique ability to generate ROS in dark, without any photo- or chemi-activation []
 Moreover, the NPs can function as a GSH-dependent GPx mimic to scavenge H2O2 in physiological milieu
 In order to explore the redox buffering effect of C-Mn3O4 NPs, we used the DCFH assay and measured the DCF intensity as a quantitative marker of ROS present in the reaction medium
 First, we evaluated the in vitro redox buffering capacity of the synthesized NPs using H2O2 as an oxidant molecule
 Figure 2a reflects the rate of DCFH oxidation with an increasing concentrations of H2O2 added to aqueous medium
 The results clearly shows that the DCFH oxidation increased significantly with increasing concentration of HO
 On the other hand, introduction of C-Mn3O4 NPs into the medium resulted into insignificant alteration in DCF intensity even after the addition of the highest concentration of HO
 As shown in Figure 2a, the DCFH oxidation rate remained almost constant up to the addition of 
5 mM of HO
 It signifies the efficient quenching of ROS generated from H2O2 by C-Mn3O4 NPs
 It should be noted that C-Mn3O4 NPs always maintained a constant ROS concentration in the reaction medium instead of eliminating all the ROS
 Figure 2a depicts the relation between the DCFH oxidation rate (Vf) and oxidant (H2O2) concentration
 Here, it is evident that DCFH oxidation by H2O2 follows an exponential kinetics and the oxidation rate clearly reduced in presence of Next we quantified the in-vitro redox buffering capacity of the synthesized NPs
 As per definition, the redox buffer capacity of a system is numerically equal to the magnitude of change of concentration of an oxidant (or a reductant) added to a solution, which is reduced or oxidized, to change the effective reduction potential by 1 unit (1 V) []

 ;    Where cox represents the concentration of the oxidant added to the system
 Experimentally, the redox buffering capacity and the effective reduction potential can be determined from the dependence of 1/Vf on 1/cox (Figure b)
 The correlation can be max is the highest rate of DCFH oxidation and kcap is a constant having dimension of concentration
 According to Eq
 2, the redox buffering capacity (from the tangent of slope angle of the plot of 1/Vf (Y-axis) vs
 1/cox (X-axis)
 Figure 2b shows the significantly higher (~
3 times) redox buffering capacity of C-Mn3O4 To test the aforementioned redox buffering ability of C-Mn3O4 NPs in the cellular milieu we used human erythrocytes, or red blood corpuscle (RBC)
 The choice of erythrocytes was based on the fact that (i) their continuous exposure to high oxygen tensions, (ii) inability to replace damaged components, and (iii) the composition of membrane lipids partly of polyunsaturated fatty acid side chains that are vulnerable to peroxidation
 Exogenously introduced H2O2 served as the inducer of oxidative stress
 It is well-known that H2O2 generates massive oxidative stress and perturbs the intracellular redox state
 For living cells, the electron donating and electron accepting capabilities of the intracellular medium can be specified by the value of effective redox potential, and any change in effective redox potential can be measured using specific redox sensor like DCFH in our study
 Figure 2c and 2d represent the in-cellulo redox buffering capacity of C-Mn3O4 NPs
 It is evident from the results that the DCF intensity of the RBCs treated with C-Mn3O4 NPs is significantly lower than the control RBCs treated with normal saline (Figure c)

 ;    the redox buffering capacity of C-Mn3O4 NPs (
46 units) when integrated in erythrocytes is significantly higher (~
9 times) compared to the intrinsic cellular components (
24 units) (Figure d)
 It has to be noted that the redox buffering capacity of the C-Mn3O4 NPs in cellular system is considerably higher compared to in vitro aqueous system
 This may be due to the additional (i
 e
, other than direct antioxidant activity) GPx mimicking activity of the C-Mn3O4 NPs [18] which can only happen in presence of GSH, and intracellular metabolite
 Redox buffering requires sensing and rapid adjustment in the redox environment to maintain the oxidative eustress in cells
 Cumulative data obtained from the experiments (both in-vitro and in-cellulo) suggest that C-Mn3O4 NPs can sense and swiftly shift the redox state in the favour of oxidative eustress
 This behaviour of C-Mn3O4 NPs as a redox modulator is consistent with that of pH buffers
 pH buffers adjust the pH of the solution by sensing the concentration of H+ ions present
 Similarly, C-Mn3O4 NPs perceive the amount of ROS in the medium and change its redox state accordingly
 Also, it has been shown that a significant change in the concentration of C-Mn3O4 NPs in the solution can cause a change in the redox Previous studies suggest that for maintaining the oxidative eustress, C-Mn3O4 NPs generate comproportionation of the surface Mn2+/Mn3+/Mn4+ ions present at the spinel structure []
 Electrons, produced from this process of conversion of Mn2+ Mn3+ Mn4+, react with the dissolved O2 and H2O of the medium and produce ROS
 The ROS produced in this process is simultaneously neutralized by the conversion of Mn4+ Mn3+ Mn2+, i
 e
 the opposite pathway [17, 19, ]
 Therefore, when the cells stay at oxidative eustress condition, a dynamic equilibrium is maintained between the generation and elimination of ROS by C-Mn3O4 NPs
 However, in many instances, the ROS level in the cells decreases resulting into immune suppression
 During this condition the ROS generated by C-Mn3O4 NPs can take part in the cellular signalling process and maintain the normal cell functions
 On the other hand, in oxidative distress conditions, the scenario becomes more complicated
 The C-Mn3O4 NPs can follow numerous buffering strategies to mitigate the oxidative distress
 Besides quenching of ROS through the conversion of Mn2+/Mn3+/Mn4+, another likely strategy is that, in ROS excess medium, NPs act as a cofactor to some antioxidant enzymes and directly help (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    intracellular anti-oxidant defence system [17, 20, ]
 Furthermore, the NPs can function as a GSH-dependent GPx mimic and scavenge excess ROS being incorporated into the cellular The combined results suggest that the C-Mn3O4 NPs can efficiently function as a redox buffer in intracellular condition
 The described redox titration method could be beneficial for comparing buffering capacity, as a marker of cyto-compatibility of different nanomaterials Next we evaluated chronic toxicity of C-Mn3O4 NPs in animal model
 With all newly developed nanoparticles, the potential for toxicity remains a factor in determining their NPs are administered in vivo, the most important physiological system they interact with is the blood and blood components
 Then, if cleared by immune cells, they leave away from the bloodstream and reach the target organ []
 Thus, it is important to measure the hemocompatibility of the NPs targeted for therapeutic use
 We performed the hemolysis assay for evaluation of the hemolytic behaviors of C-Mn3O4 NPs on isolated mouse erythrocytes
 The erythrocytes were first isolated by centrifugation and purified by sequential washes with sterile isotonic phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 
4, then diluted to 5% hematocrit and incubated with different concentrations of NP suspensions (
01, 
05- or 
1-ml ml-1 PBS)
 The same amount of PBS was used as the negative control
 An aqueous solution of RBCs was used as a positive control that is likely to show hemolysis
 After 6 hrs incubation at room temperature, the samples were spun down to check the extent of hemolysis
 Considering the hemolytic ability of positive control (water) as 100%, all the NP treated samples showed negligible (<5%) hemolysis (Figure 3a and b)
 Corresponding absorbance spectra (with the supernatant after final centrifugation) showed the optical features of C-Mn3O4 NPs (Figure 3c) with ligand to metal charge transfer band at 300 nm and d-d transition bands at 429, 526 nm
 Only the positive control sample showed a distinct absorbance signature of hemoglobin with the Sorret band at 420 nm and Q-bands at 546 and 576 nm (Figure c)
 The scanning electron micrographs (SEM) (Figure 3e) of erythrocytes and Leishman stained whole blood smears supported the same (Figure f)

 ;    interaction, and the erythrocytes maintained normal biconcave shape just like control ones (Figure 3e & f)
 To study the in vivo effect of C-Mn3O4 NPs on blood, different hematology and serum biochemical indicators were measured after 90-days administration of the particles
 All hematology marker values were within normal ranges and did not indicate a trend of toxicity associated with NPs (Supplementary Table S)
 We further went on to assay ALAD activity, an important enzyme in the hematopoietic pathway which usually gets downregulated in cases of metal toxicity, particularly due to exposure of heavy metals like lead, mercury, etc
 [23] However, we found no change in the activity of ALAD (Figure d)
 The hematoxylin and eosin stained spleen showed no abnormality (Figure g)
 These results High dose of C-Mn3O4 NPs cause mild oxidative damage to liver
 The results of biodistribution (Supplementary Figure S1) study suggest the affinity of C-Mn3O4 NPs towards the liver
 The gross morphology (Figure 4a) and relative liver weights do not reveal any toxic effect on the organ
 But compared to control animals, 
5 mg kg-1 BW NP-treated mice (not the other two groups of NP treated ones) displayed significantly higher 4b & 4c, p<
001 in one way ANOVA)
 A similar trend was observed in the case of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and -glutamyl transferase (GT) activity (Figure 4d & 4e), however, bilirubin levels showed no significant differences among groups (Figure f)
 The increased serum activity of transferases, normally confined within hepatic cells (not in serum), can be attributed to the damaged structural integrity of hepatocytes and subsequent release into the circulation
 To know the real reason behind such elevated liver function parameters in the case of 
5 mg kg-1 BW NP-treated mice we went of histological analysis
 In vehicle control animals, liver sections showed normal hepatic cells with well-preserved cytoplasm, prominent nucleus and nucleolus, and central vein (Figure a)
 They along with 
1 and 
25 mg kg-1 BW NP-treated livers displayed characteristic hepatic architecture with hepatic plates directed from the portal triads toward the central vein where they freely anastomose
 Inflammatory cells were seen intervening the hepatic strands and surrounding degenerative hepatocytes (Figure a)
 In addition, pericentral vein inflammation was also seen

 ;    calcification were observed in the same group of mice (Figure a)
 Thus, it is evident from the results of histopathological observations and liver function tests that C-Mn3O4 NPs at the highest administered dose (
5 mg kg-1 BW) can cause moderate hepatic toxicity
 Previously, we have demonstrated the NPs ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aqueous solution
 So, to understand the pathophysiological mechanism of observed toxicity, we (MDA) content, a byproduct of lipid peroxidation and also an index of oxidative damage, which was found to be high in 
5 mg kg-1 BW NP-treated group (Figure i)
 We further extended our investigation to the changes in activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) which creates a mutually supportive team to fight against increased ROS [17, ]
 We found the downregulation of all the antioxidant enzyme activities in 
5 mg kg-1 BW NP-treated mice compared to control (Figure j-l)
 The mitochondrial markers of oxidative damage like mPTP opening, membrane potential, and ATP content followed same trend (Figure m-o)
 Though previous studies have shown that, Mn3O4 NPs can display antioxidant enzyme mimetic (particularly SOD and CAT) activity in the cellular environment, the humongous amount of ROS instantaneously generated due to high local concentration of NPs cannot be quenched through that mechanism
 It should be noted that at the therapeutic dose (
25 mg kg-1 BW NPs) there is no evidence of oxidative Moderate to high dose of C-Mn3O4 NPs show mild to moderate inflammatory response in Sections of lung tissue from control and low dose C-Mn3O4 NP treated animals have the normal appearance of fine lace because most of the lung is composed of thin-walled alveoli (Figure a)
 The alveoli are composed of a single layer of flattened epithelial cells and pneumocytes
 Between the alveoli a thin layer of connective tissue and numerous capillaries are also lined with endothelium
 However, the sections from moderate and high dose groups showed signs of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia in patchy manner other than normal lung architecture
 The cellular pattern consists primarily of mild to moderate chronic interstitial inflammation, containing lymphocytes and a few plasma cells, in a uniform and patchy distribution
 Signs of fibrosis, honeycombing, hyaline membranes and granulomas are absent

 ;    This kind of histological features may arise from the localization of particulate matters (as evident from our biodistribution study) in lungs []
 This features are generally reversible and do not cause long term harm to the subjects []
 Most of the drugs and xenobiotics pass through the kidney for excretion
 But earlier studies have described that Mn cannot excrete through it
 Our biodistribution results also revealed minimal deposition of Mn in the Kidney (Supplementary Figure S)
 The histological analysis shows no damage and the normal structure of medulla and cortex was maintained in all four groups in spite of sexuality (Figure b)
 Consistent with these findings other parameters like BUN, Creatinine, Urine Volume, Urine Protein and albumin to creatinine ratio remained Affinity of nanoparticles towards testes is contradictory
 Several nanoparticles such as gold and magnetic nanoparticles have been reported to enter testes in small quantities, whereas carbon nanotubes behave oppositely []
 Our biodistribution results indicate that C-Mn3O4 NPs could enter or accumulate in the testis
 The average testis weight (Supplementary Figure S3a), and morphology (Figure 5c) of NP-treated mice did not show any significant difference compared to the control mice
 The observed accumulation of C-Mn3O4 NPs in the testes upon chronic repeated dose administration have not shown any adverse effect on Sertoli cells, seminiferous tubules and germ cell nuclear volume (Supplementary Figure Sb-Sd)
 Figure 5c presents hematoxylin and eosin stained cross-section structure of the testes of control and C-Mn3O4 NP treated mice
 It is well known that within the seminiferous tubules, sperm cells are generated through differentiation of spermatozoa by meiosis
 Microscopic images show normal testes structure for control mice (Figure c)
 Histologic examination of the cross sections of testes from all three dose group showed no alteration even after 90 days of administration (Figure c)
 Leydig cells or spermatids were similar in all groups
 The sperm counts and sperm motility showed similar trends (Supplementary Figure Se-Sg)

 The results (Supplementary Figure S3h-S3j) indicate that the NPs did not alter plasma sex Similar to male reproductive system, no observable sign of toxicity was found in case of female reproductive system
 The haematoxylin and eosin stained sections of ovary from primary, pre-antral and antral follicles), corpora luteum, Graafian follicles and atretic follicles were found in the cortex of the ovary which was covered by a surface epithelium (Figure d)
 The ovary of Mn3O4 NPs treated mice (at any dose) did not show any noticeable changes in histology such as formation of fibrosis or cyst
 The total number of healthy follicles (all categories) remains same after chronic exposure of Mn3O4 NPs across three dose groups (Supplementary Figure Sb)
 The mean number of corpora lutea in mice remained same in all groups
 The estrus cycle was normal with typical distribution of diestrus, estrus, proestrus and metestrus stages (Supplementary Figure S3c & Sd)
 The hormone levels showed no We further investigated the effect of C-Mn3O4 NPs on plasma glucose levels and its metabolism
