 Sequencing data has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA was highest in the lungs, but the heart, kidney, and liver also showed substantial amounts
 In fact, above 1,000 copies of SARS-CoV-2 virus were detected in The heart is one of the many organs with high expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE)

 We previously identified several approved drugs with potency to inhibit inflammatory drug used in the treatment of asthma and stroke, is now under progress of clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients
 Therefore, we screened another type of drug that has an additional potency marked ACE2 internalization by S protein (50 nM) treatment (Figure A)
 Among top 13 levels18, showed the best potency to inhibit the S protein-induced ACE2 internalization (Figure 1B, Table )

 In fact, HiLyte Fluor 555-labeled S protein was which was significantly suppressed by clomipramine treatment
 These results suggest that clomipramine could be repurposed for the treatment with COVID-19 by inhibiting ACE2 Clinically, it is important whether drug treatment after SARS-CoV-2 infection is effective
 We confirmed that treatment with clomipramine 1 hour after pseudovirus infection also prevented the intracellular viral RNA level by 91% (for 6 hours) and 67% (for 18 hours (Figure B-C)
 In contrast, treatment with ibudilast failed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus infection (Figure B-D)

 Higher concentration (> 10 M) of clomipramine was required to significantly suppress the interaction between S protein and ACE2, and amitriptyline, another tricyclic antidepressant like clomipramine, never suppress the binding of S protein to ACE2 (Figure B)
 Clomipramine failed to reduce ACE2 enzyme activity (Figure C)
 These results suggest that clomipramine does not seemingly bind with ACE2 but non-competitively inhibits ACE2 internalization in the cells
 The receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein reportedly activates the ACE2-mediated endocytic signal pathway, by which SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the susceptible cells
 We first attempted a structure-activity relationship analysis among tricyclic antidepressants with a structure similar to clomipramine, but it was difficult because none of the compounds showed significant inhibition of ACE2 internalization (Figure D-F)
 An in silico docking analysis suggests that clomipramine interacts with the S protein at one end of its RBD (Figure 
G) and that the interacting residues are distinct from other candidate compounds (Figure D-F)
 However, no apparent correlation was observed between the estimated binding energies and the internalization suppression ratio (Figure D-E)

 ;    drugs that are expected to repurpose their indications for COVID-19 treatment have been identified one after another, but there is still few effective drug proven in clinical trials established by WHO
 Clomipramine, clinically applied as a tricyclic antidepressant, has been used in basic research as a pharmacological tool to inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis26, and therefore speculated to have antiviral activity
 We substantiated that CMs by preventing ACE2 internalization (Figure 1, )
 In addition to a long half-life similar inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1, 2), suggesting that the antiviral effect of clomipramine lasts for a long time
 In the process of SARS-CoV-2 virus lysosome fusion pathway (targeted by chloroquine) have been attracted attention as therapeutic targets
 In fact, several candidate compounds have also been identified,
 On the other hand, we have not clarified the molecular mechanism underlying demonstrated a potent inhibition of ACE2 internalization due to pseudovirus infection, no drug with the same or better inhibitory effect as clomipramine was obtained (Figure )

 ;    As to the possibility of the improvement of severe COVID-19 by clomipramine, we suggest an anti-inflammatory effect of clomipramine like ibudilast
 We have previously reported that transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 3 protein, a major component caused by anti-cancer drug treatment16, by promoting NADPH oxidase (Nox) -Severe COVID-19 symptoms include abnormalities of many organs other than the heart, fever,
 Particularly, ibudilast, identified as the best potent inhibitor of TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation, is now under progress of clinical trials for the treatment of ARDS in shown)
 Thus, future studies using COVID-19 model animals will clarify whether clomipramine is effective for the prevention and treatment of severe COVID-
 infection, its mode of action was not competitive inhibition
 In silico docking analysis predicts that clomipramine interacts with the S protein at the end of the RBD domain, binding is weak and therefore this might not fully explain the potent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection by clomipramine

 ;    The ACE2 upregulation due to exposure to risk factors for severe COVID-19 is considered as a compensatory mechanism for attenuating the action of angiotensin (Ang) II
 Clomipramine does not affect basal ACE2 expression level, but suppresses pathological ACE2 upregulation caused by exposure to risk factors
 Additionally, since clomipramine has no impact on ACE2 enzyme activity, it is considered that clomipramine has little effect on AngII and Ang1-7 / Mas receptor signaling pathways in normal cells
 On the other hand, it has been reported that Ang1-7 / Mas receptor signaling is attenuated is also expected to contribute to the maintenance of Ang1-7 / Mas receptor signaling after In conclusion, this study establishes clomipramine as a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent a promising therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of severe COVID-
