 ;    maximise weight loss and improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes and obesity
 In this study we investigated the cellular and metabolic effects of modulating the balance between G protein activation and -arrestin-2 recruitment at GLP-1R and GCGR using oxyntomodulin (OXM)-derived co-agonists
 This strategy has been previously shown to improve the duration of action of GLP-1R assessed for a variety of cellular readouts
 Molecular dynamic simulations were used to gain insights into the molecular interactions involved
 In vivo studies were performed in mice to identify internalisation and prolonged glucose-lowering action in vivo
 The putative benefits of GCGR agonism were retained, with equivalent weight loss compared to the GLP-1R mono-agonist liraglutide in spite of a lesser degree of food intake suppression
 The compounds tested showed only a minor degree of biased agonism between G protein and -arrestin-2 recruitment at both receptors and were best classified as partial agonists for the two pathways measured
 Conclusions: Diminishing -arrestin-2 recruitment may be an effective way to increase the therapeutic efficacy of GLP-1R/GCGR co-agonists
 These benefits can be achieved by partial rather (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    Insulin and glucagon are traditionally viewed as opposing protagonists in the hormonal control of (GSIS), such as analogues of the incretin glucagon-like pepide-1 (GLP-1), have been successfully exploited over many years for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) []
 However, decades of attempts to develop glucagon receptor (GCGR) antagonists for clinical use have so far failed to yield any approved therapeutic agents []
 A significant problem appears to be the development of hepatic steatosis [-]
 Contrasting with this traditional approach, GCGR agonism has emerged as a credible component of combined therapeutic strategy for the treatment of obesity and T2D in which GLP-1R and GCGR are concurrently targeted [7,8], thereby recapitulating the effects of the glucagon on energy expenditure [10], leading to enhanced weight loss and ultimately improvements in insulin sensitivity [11], might then be safely realised in the context of GLP-1R-mediated protection against acute hyperglycaemia
 Glucagon is also insulinotropic, an effect which derives from action Biased agonism is a concept in which different ligands for the same receptor selectively couple to different intracellular effectors [14], potentially providing a means to improve their therapeutic window by reducing activation of pathways associated with adverse effects []
 For G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), bias is commonly, but not always, expressed as a relative preference for recruitment of G proteins versus -arrestins, i
 e
 two of the most proximal interactors recruited to the activated receptor, as well as their corresponding signalling intermediates
 Both GLP-1R and GCGR are primarily coupled to cAMP generation through Gs activation, with recruitment of -arrestins being associated with receptor desensitisation, endocytosis and diminished long term functional responses [,]
 Whilst the therapeutic benefits of biased GLP-1R agonism have been demonstrated in preclinical studies on a number of occasions [18-21], the application of this principle to GLP-1R/GCGR co-agonism is less explored

 Focussing on the peptide N-terminus, we evaluated dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4 (DPP-4)-resistant peptides featuring 2-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) at position 2, in combination with which a switch between glutamine (Q) and histidine (H) at position 3 was able to alter the maximum responses (i
 e
 efficacy) for G protein and -arrestin recruitment, to varying degrees, at both receptors
 Molecular dynamics simulation of glucagon analogues interacting with GCGR was used to gain insight into the molecular interactions underlying these differences
 By comparing the metabolic effects of a pair of matched peptides with these sequence substitutions, we demonstrate that reduced recruitment efficacy of -arrestins translates to improved efficacy in preclinical rodent models of obesity, consistent with a similar effect previously observed for GLP-1R mono-agonists [-]

1 Characterisation of N-terminal peptide substitutions that modulate coupling to Gs and The N-termini of GLP-1, glucagon and OXM play critical roles in the activation of their target receptors [,]
 However, the alanine (in GLP-1) or serine (in glucagon and OXM) at position 2 renders each of these endogenous ligands susceptible to DPP-4-mediated cleavage, and pharmacologically stabilised incretin analogues are often modified at this position
 Here we focussed on the AIB2 substitution, found in semaglutide and some investigational oxyntomodulin analogues [-]
 To systematically investigate how this change affects receptor activation, we obtained GLP-1-AIB2 and glucagon-AIB2 (GCG-AIB2) (see Table 1) and measured recruitment of -arrestin-2 and mini-Gs to GLP-1R and GCGR in real time using nanoBiT complementation [,]
 Area-under-curve (AUC) quantification from kinetic response data indicated that efficacy for -arrestin-2 recruitment to GLP-1R was modestly reduced with GLP-1-AIB2 compared to native GLP-1 (Table 2, Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure A)
 However, quantification of bias using the log(max/EC50) scale [26] indicated that this selective efficacy reduction does not qualify GLP-1-AIB2 as a biased agonist, as it was compensated by a corresponding small increase in potency (Figure 1B, C)
 The lack of bias is represented in Figure 1C by the 95% confidence intervals for GLP--AIB2 crossing zero
 At GCGR, the impact of AIB2 was more striking, with large reductions in efficacy for both mini-Gs and -arrestin-2 observed (Figure 1A); interestingly, this effect at GCGR could be partly reversed for both pathways by concurrent substitution of glutamine (Q) at position 3 to histidine (H), which our in-house preliminary evaluations had already flagged as a route to modulate GCGR signalling
 GCG-AIB2 showed moderate but statistically significant degree of bias in favour of mini-Gs recruitment, with the H3 substitution driving the bias factor back towards zero An alternative method for bias quantification has been proposed [27,44] that is applicable to scenarios when kinetic response data is available

 ;    termed k, from the initial response rate at a saturating agonist concentration
 After logarithmic transformation of k, bias can be determined by first normalising to a reference ligand (giving log k) and then comparing responses between pathways (giving log k)
 In our study, mini-Gs responses could be fitted as one-phase exponential association curves, whereas -arrestin-2 showed a characteristic rapid increase and slower decline, presumed to reflect -arrestin association followed by dissociation from the target receptor, and required a bi-exponential equation to define association and dissociation rate constants [45] (Figure D)
 GLP-1-AIB2 showed subtly slower kinetics at GLP-1R for both pathways than did GLP-1, which did not translate to a significant degree of bias using the log k method (Table 2, Figure C)
 At GCGR, mini-Gs and -arrestin-2 association kinetics were also slower for GCG-AIB2 than for glucagon (Figure 1D, Table 2), with bias assessment from the kinetic data again suggesting a preference for mini-Gs coupling that was negated with the introduction of H3 (i
 e
 less bias with GCG-AIB2H3 than GCG-AIB2; Figure C)
 Overall, these data indicate that introducing the AIB2 substitution into GLP-1 and glucagon leads to a noticeable reduction in efficacy for -arrestin-2 recruitment, more than mini-Gs recruitment, with glucagon more affected than GLP-
 However, at GCGR, this effect could be mitigated by the presence of H
 The Q/H switch at position 3 thereby provides a means to modulate efficacy whilst We performed molecular dynamics simulations of the active state GCGR in complex with glucagon, GCG-AIB2, or GCG-AIB2H3 to retrieve insights into the effects that peptide mutations have on the interactions, fingerprints and receptor flexibility
 The substitution of serine at position 2 with the nonstandard residue AIB produced a substantial loss of interactions with the top of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) and TM7 (E

 ;    chain (Table 3) and moved the barycenter of the interactions towards extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) (D299ECL2, S297ECL2 in Figure 2A, 2B) due to hydrogen bonds with H1 and T5 (Table )
 The partial release of TM6 from the restraining interactions with the peptide N-termini is corroborated by the high flexibility displayed in Figure C
 GCGR in complex with glucagon and AIB2H3, on the other hand, was characterized by low plasticity of TM6, as indicated by monodisperse probability curves
 Overall, glucagon and GCG-AIB2 stabilised divergent GCGR conformations of TM6, ECL2 and ECL3 (Figure D)
 Interestingly, in the closely related GLP-1R the ECL2 is essential for transducing peptides more prone to interact with ECL3 and -arrestin-influenced signaling events such as Simulations suggested that the Q3H mutation introduced in GCG-AIB2H3 favors interactions between the peptide and TM2 residues K

 As the previous peptide was derived from OXM, it contained the N-terminal sequence H-S-Q, which was modified to H-AIB-Q (SRB103Q) or H-AIB-H (SRB103H), along with additional conservative changes to enhance physicochemical properties such as stability and solubility

 ;    The mini-Gs and -arrestin-2 recruitment profiles for each ligand were compared at both GLP-1R and GCGR (Figure 3A, Table 4, Supplementary Figure B)
 At GLP-1R, AUC analysis from the kinetic response data indicated a 40% reduction in -arrestin-2 efficacy but a small increase in potency for the AIB2Q3 ligand compared to AIB2H3, with the mini-Gs response unaffected
 At GCGR, both potency and efficacy were significantly reduced for both pathways with the AIB2Q3 ligand, although the magnitude of the efficacy reduction (~20%) was small compared to the same sequence substitutions when applied to glucagon in Figure 
 Using the log(max/EC50) method there was no statistically significant bias between mini-Gs and -arrestin-2 for SRB103Q versus SRB103H at either receptor (Figure 3B, C)
 However, bias estimates from the kinetic responses (log k method) suggested a subtle preference for SRB103Q at GLP-1R towards mini-Gs recruitment cAMP signalling responses were also assessed in CHO-K1 cell lines expressing GLP-1R, GCGR or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) (Figure 3E, Table )
 Potencies for SRB103Q and SRB103H were, as expected, indistinguishable at GLP-1R, with a non-significant reduction for SRB103Q at GCGR
 Both ligands showed at least 100-fold reduced potency for GIPR cAMP signalling compared to GIP itself, even in this highly amplified heterologous system, suggesting that GIPR is unlikely to contribute to their overall metabolic actions
 A close correlation has been observed previously between signalling efficacy and ligand-induced endocytosis of GLP-1R [,]
 GCGR, on the other hand, appears to internalise far more slowly [,]
 We investigated the effects of SRB103Q and SRB103H on internalisation of GLP-1R and GCGR SNAP-tagged at their N-termini in HEK293T cells by high content imaging []
 Both ligands induced pronounced GLP-1R internalisation, with a minor reduction in efficacy with SRB103Q, but GCGR barely internalised with either ligand (Figure 3F); higher resolution images of SNAP-GLP-1R or SNAP-GCGR-expressing cells labelled prior to agonist treatment corroborated these findings (DERET) [50], kinetics of GLP-1R internalisation were considerably slower for SRB103Q than for (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    SRB103H throughout the concentration range (Figure 3H, 3I), although using AUC quantified from the end of the stimulation period, SRB103Q internalisation efficacy was only subtly reduced (Figure 3J), similar to the result in the high content imaging assay
  These data indicate that the AIB2Q3 iteration of SRB103 shows reduced efficacy for recruitment of -arrestin-2 at GLP-1R and, to a lesser degree, for mini-Gs and -arrestin-2 at the GCGR
  Reductions in -arrestin-2 recruitment efficacy are associated with prolongation of cAMP signalling at GLP-1R [19,39] and GCGR [31], thought to result from avoidance of target receptor desensitisation
 In dispersed mouse islet cells, biochemically-measured acute cAMP responses to SRB103Q and SRB103H were indistinguishable (Figure A)
 Similarly, FRET imaging of intact mouse islets virally transduced to express the cAMP sensor epac2-camps [51] demonstrated that both agonists induce similar cAMP dynamics acutely (Figure B)
 However, when pre-treated for four hours with each ligand and then rechallenged after a washout period, a trend towards reduced responsiveness for SRB103H was observed
 This difference was not significant when quantified from the whole re-stimulation period, but it was clearly observed that the epac2-camps average signal increase on SRB103H rechallenge was slower than for SRB103Q (k=
28 versus 
53 min-1 responsiveness with the former ligand
 GCGR responses were also evaluated in primary mouse hepatocytes; here, SRB103Q showed reduced potency acutely, but after overnight treatment, this difference had disappeared (Figure C)
 Overall, these studies indicate a general tendency for SRB103Q responses to be relatively enhanced with longer stimulations, which is compatible with (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

5 Anti-hyperglycaemic responses are prolonged after a single dose of SRB103Q versus As GLP-1R agonists with reduced -arrestin-2 recruitment efficacy and/or delayed endocytosis [19,21,52], we aimed to establish if this therapeutic principle could also be applied to GLP-tolerance test (IPGTT) in lean mice tended to be lower after a single administration of SRB103Q compared to SRB103H, with this difference enhanced by longer agonist exposure time (Figure A)
 A similar pattern was seen at a range of agonist doses (Supplementary Figure 3A) and in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice (Figure B)
 Circulating concentrations of each ligand were the same 4 hours after a single dose, suggesting pharmacodynamic differences are unlikely to be due to altered Both GLP-1R and GCGR agonism potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion [12], but can also measured 10 min into a 4-hour-delayed IPGTT were higher with SRB103Q than SRB103H treatment, suggesting the formers improved anti-hyperglycaemic efficacy is likely to derive at least partly from action on beta cells (Figure 5C), in keeping with the trend we observed in pancreatic islets towards improved responsiveness after prolonged stimulation with SRBQ
 In contrast, there was no evidence that insulin sensitivity was increased with either ligand, as assessed by insulin tolerance tests performed 4 hours after agonist administration (Figure 5D, Supplementary Figure C)
 Appetite suppression was also assessed in lean and diet-induced obese mice
 Here, SRB103Q was more effective than SRB103H, particularly at later timepoints in the obese cohort Overall, these results indicate that, despite showing lower acute efficacy for intracellular effector recruitment at both GLP-1R and GCGR, SRB103Q shows greater bioactivity in mice than SRBH
 For glycaemic effects, this difference tended to become more apparent with time, in (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    keeping with the previously established principle that the metabolic advantages of biased GLP-1R GLP-1R/GCGR co-agonists may hold advantages over GLP-1R mono-agonists for the treatment obesity and related metabolic diseases as their GCGR-mediated effects on energy expenditure can promote additional weight loss [,,]
 To determine if the apparent benefits of SRB103Q on glucose homeostasis revealed in single dose studies are also maintained after repeated dosing, SRB103H, SRB103Q and the GLP-1R mono-agonist liraglutide were administered at matched doses to DIO mice for 2 weeks
 The dose was up-titrated over several days, analogous to typical practice in the clinic, as well as in preclinical studies of incretin receptor agonists [,]
 As expected, all agonists led to a significant amount of weight loss compared to vehicle (Figure A)
 However, the trajectory for weight lowering differed for both dual GLP-1R/GCGR agonists compared to liraglutide, with the latter being more effective earlier in the study before reaching a plateau after one week, as commonly observed with GLP-1R mono-agonists in rodents [-]
 Importantly, the weight loss with both dual agonists was achieved despite liraglutide being more effective at suppressing energy intake throughout the study (Figure 6B), suggesting a contribution of increased energy expenditure []
 Interestingly, SRB103Q was moderately more effective for weight loss than SRB103H despite similar energy intake, raising the possibility that reduced GCGR desensitisation could have contributed to improved longer term effects on energy expenditure
 Both SRB103Q and SRB103H outperformed liraglutide in an IPGTT performed at the end of the study, with SRB103Q being the most effective at reducing the glucose excursion (Figure C)

 ;    In this study we have carefully evaluated the effects on GLP-1R and GCGR activity of the AIB2 substitution commonly used to confer DPP-4 resistance to therapeutic GLP-1R/GCGR peptide agonists
 Depending on the peptide context, this substitution reduced efficacy for recruitment of key intracellular effectors at both target receptors
 Interestingly, this effect was counteracted by substituting the neighbouring amino acid Q to H, providing a means to compare the impact of the resultant efficacy changes whilst retaining DPP-4 resistance
 Whilst the efficacy-reducing effect of AIB2 was most prominently observed with glucagon itself at GCGR, in the context of the SRB103 peptides this effect was in fact greater at GLP-1R, specifically for -arrestin-2 recruitment, although GCGR responses were also modestly reduced
 The potential importance of this pharmacological finding was hinted at by studies in primary islets and hepatocytes  tissues in which these responses are chiefly driven by, respectively, GLP-1R and GCGR  where we observed that the lower efficacy SRB103Q ligand showed trends towards relatively enhanced signalling responses at both GLP-1R and GCGR over time
 These observations support our in vivo findings that the improved anti-hyperglycaemic performance of SRB103Q becomes more apparent at later time-points after dosing, as was previously seen with GLP-1R mono-agonists with analogous signalling This study was originally designed to assess the potential for biased agonism to improve therapeutic targeting of GLP-1R and GCGR
 However, the magnitude of bias between SRB103Q and SRB103H, as assessed by two validated models, was relatively small
 Interestingly, whilst biased agonism has attracted much attention over recent years, it has also been suggested that low intrinsic signalling efficacy, rather than biased agonism per se, is a viable alternative explanation for the improved performance of certain  opioid receptor agonists [61], a GPCR target usually considered highly tractable to biased agonism []
 This possibility is reinforced by a lack of consistency between formal bias estimates obtained from different analytical approaches, which can lead to different conclusions from the same data []
 With regard to the lower efficacy SRB103Q agonist in our study, signal amplification downstream of Gs activation means full cAMP/PKA (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    responses are still possible, so, in combination with reduced efficacy for -arrestin recruitment, this could lead to reductions in desensitisation over time and allow longer-lasting signalling responses
 Thus, beneficial responses from partial agonism may be achieved irrespective of whether formally quantified bias is present or not
 Further evaluations to establish whether partial agonism or bias is the most important factor will be required to settle this issue
 The AIB2 substitution at position 2 is one of a number of sequence modifications that has been trialled to obtain DPP-4 resistance for incretin receptor analogues
 Whilst exendin-4, the prototypical DPP-4 resistant GLP-1R mono-agonist, contains a glycine at position 2, GLP-1-G2 was recognised in early studies to show an unacceptable loss of signalling potency [64]; more recently it was demonstrated that this is also associated with reduced efficacy for recruitment of both mini-Gs and -arrestin-2 to the GLP-1R []
 AIB2 is better tolerated by GLP-1 than G2, whilst retaining identical protection against DPP-4 mediated degradation [64], and has been incorporated into the current leading GLP-1R mono-agonist semaglutide []
 Our new data indicates that, in the context of native GLP-1, AIB2 leads to a significant reduction in efficacy for recruitment of -arrestin-2 whilst barely affecting recruitment of mini-Gs
 This effect is likely to be peptide-specific, as we did not observe similar reductions in -arrestin recruitment by AIB2-containing semaglutide in a previous study []
 Interestingly, in the present work, AIB2 led to marked attenuation of engagement of GCGR with intracellular effectors by glucagon analogues, an effect which was previously hinted by the lower cAMP signalling potency with a glucagon analogue bearing AIB at both position 2 and 16 []
 In the latter study, GCGR signalling was partly restored by conjugation to a fatty acid moiety, a well-established strategy used primarily to extend peptide pharmacokinetics by promoting reversible binding to albumin but, in this case, also found to enhance receptor activation
 In our study we observed that switching Q to H at position 3 of glucagon was an alternative means to reverse the deleterious effect of AIB2 on GCGR signalling
 It is not clear however if these strategies are equivalent, as in the study of Ward et al [66] the signalling deficit seen with AIB2 was a reduction in cAMP potency, whereas in our study efficacies for mini-Gs and -arrestin-2 was reduced but potencies were unaffected
 A recent evaluation of GLP-1R/GCGR co-agonists [22] showed that the (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    al [67], which includes the N-terminal sequence H-AIB-Q, does indeed show reductions in -arrestin recruitment efficacy to GLP-1R (modest) and GCGR (substantial) compared to the endogenous agonist, without major loss in potency, broadly matching our observations with native ligand analogues and SRB103 peptides
 Measured signalling potency, especially in the context of significantly amplified responses e
 g
 cAMP, is driven to varying extents by both affinity and efficacy, with our results highlighting how the standard approach to evaluate incretin receptor agonists in vitro using cAMP in heterologous systems, which tends to render all compounds full agonists, may be insufficient to adequately decipher ligand pharmacology []
 Importantly, our study also provides structural insights into the importance of position 2 of glucagon peptide analogues, with molecular dynamics simulations indicating that the reduced -arrestin-2 recruitment associated with The most striking results in our study were observed from in vivo comparisons of SRB103Q and SRBH
 Here, the lower efficacy SRB103Q (at both GLP-1R and GCGR) peptide outperformed SRB103H for ability to lower blood glucose levels 4 and 8 hours after a single injection, despite identical pharmacokinetics
 These findings are reminiscent of observations with exendin-phe1, a GLP-1R mono-agonist with marked reductions in -arrestin recruitment efficacy, which displayed better anti-hyperglycaemic effects and increased insulin secretion compared to exendin-4 in mice, with these differences being most obvious at later time-points []
 However, one of the challenges with our study is identifying whether the observed effects result from enhanced action primarily at GLP-1R or at GCGR, as SRB103Q displayed reduced -arrestin-2 recruitment efficacy at both receptors, meaning that longer lasting signalling through avoidance of target desensitisation could apply in both cases
 Overall, we favour a primarily GLP-1R-mediated mechanism because 1) the selective reduction in -arrestin-2 recruitment with SRB103Q was larger at GLP-1R than at GCGR, and 2) the effect was associated with increases in insulin release and supported by a trend towards reduced islet desensitisation in vitro
 Whilst glucagon can augment glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, this effect is mediated mainly by cross-reactivity at the GLP-1R []

 ;    unlikely that the lower blood glucose levels with SRB103Q result from decreased hepatic glucose output via the subtly reduced efficacy of this peptide at GCGR, as it retains full cAMP activity in mouse hepatocytes, especially with prolonged stimulations, and the observed glycaemic effects relate mainly to the ability to restrain the hyperglycaemic effect of exogenously administered glucose
 As antagonists for GLP-1R and GCGR are generally unable to cleanly and completely inhibit the action of high affinity exogenously administered agonists at pharmacological doses, studies in GLP-1R and GCGR knockout mice will be needed to distinguish the relative contributions of each receptor
 The well-known phenotype of GCGR knockout mice, which are highly resistant to hyperglycaemia and show other metabolic abnormalities [69], may introduce additional challenges SRB103Q and SRB103H were compared in a chronic administration study, with liraglutide also included for reference as an exemplar GLP-1R mono-agonist
 The important observation here was that the enhanced anti-hyperglycaemic benefits of SRB103Q were retained after 2 weeks of repeated administration, suggesting that the apparent benefits of its intracellular signalling profile on glucose homeostasis do not diminish with time
 This represents, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of the possibility of achieving more effective metabolic control through partial agonism in the context of a GLP-1R/GCGR co-agonist
 Notably, somewhat greater weight loss without a corresponding reduction in food intake for SRB103Q was observed, which could conceivably result from increases in sustained GCGR activation, as might be predicted from the reduced -arrestin-2 recruitment efficacy of this peptide compared to SRBH
 The glycaemic effects of both molecules compared favourably with liraglutide at the same dose, although differences in pharmacokinetics (longer with liraglutide) and the amount of bioactive free peptide (lower with liraglutide due to albumin binding) complicate interpretation
 Nevertheless, the observation that both SRB103 peptides achieve similar weight loss to liraglutide despite a less potent anorectic effect adds to the evidence that GLP-1R/GCGR co-agonism may be an effective means to treat obesity, potentially with reduced anorexia-associated nausea (although this was not (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    The recent study of Darbalaei et al provides a comprehensive description of the pharmacology of other published GLP-1R/GCGR co-agonists [22], including two ligands for which clinical data are available  cotadutide (MEDI0382) [8] and SAR425899 []
 Neither of these clinical candidate molecules include AIB2 at position 2, but both showed reduced recruitment of -arrestin-2 to GLP-1R, albeit the reduction was not as great as for SRBQ
 Both also showed significantly reduced recruitment of -arrestin-2 to GCGR compared to glucagon, a difference that was larger than the GCGR efficacy reduction seen with SRB103Q compared to SRBH
 Thus, cotadutide and SAR425899 may well be additional examples of incretin receptor ligands retrospectively identified as showing biased agonist properties, as was recently found for the dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonist tirzepatide [,]
 On the other hand, the recorded cAMP potencies for cotadutide and SAR425899 in the study of Darbalaei et al relative to the endogenous comparator ligands are orders of magnitude less than reported previously [70,73], raising the possibility that the cellular systems used to evaluate the pharmacology of these ligands could have affected the results
  In conclusion, our study should be seen as an evaluation of the potential for reduced efficacy to be incorporated into the assessment process for candidate dual GLP-1R/GCGR agonists
 Further molecular optimisations, e
 g
 acylation for extended pharmacokinetics, will be required to generate viable molecules for eventual clinical use
 Molecular dynamics simulations have indicated relevant differences in engagement with ECL2 and ECL3 that can be used to guide these optimisations
 Detailed mechanistic work is also needed to establish the relative contributions of G protein and -arrestin-mediated effects at both GLP-1R and GCGR, and will help clarify how investigational incretin receptor agonists are prioritised during drug development for T2D and obesity
