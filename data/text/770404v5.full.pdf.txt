 In our previous study, we found that eupatilin, a chromone-scaffold (CS) derivative (CSD), has a strong anti-fibrotic effect on in vitro fibrogenesis as well as a murine lung fibrosis model
 Through structure-activity relationship studies, ONG41008 was identified as a more potent Methods: A set of cell imaging studies, transcriptomic analyses, and in vivo mouse model (NASH) model were conducted to explore how ONG41008 exhibits both anti-fibrotic and anti-investigated in RAW

 One notable feature associated with eupatilin was able to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which plays a central role in initiation and Furthering these intriguing therapeutic capabilities, a more effective and stable analog of eupatilin, called ONG41008, was generated and subjected to ameliorating fibrogenesis and inhibiting the various disease activities associated with pMFB
 We found that ONG41008 was a potent inhibitor of TGF biogenesis such that binding of active TGF to TGF receptor (TGFR) was limited, resulting in cessation of TGFR signaling and EMT was completely inhibited, of a hybrid interactome comprising of a major nuclear reprogramming one and a minor residual fibrogenic interactome, suggesting that ONG41008 is a driver of cell reversion as we saw in the previous study of eupatilin

 Its mortality and morbidity are becoming significant such that the median survival of patients with IPF is 3~5 years after diagnosis and the majority of patients would succumb to death within 5 year of diagnosis []
 Nonalcoholic fatly liver disease (NFALD) is becoming pandemic over the world due to over-nutrition
 Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an extreme manifestation of NAFLD associated with multiple-fibrosis [3, ]
 It has been well appreciated that mitigation of liver fibrosis is the limiting step for attenuating NASH []
 Therefore, development of both potent anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory drugs is of paramount importance for dealing with IPF or NASH
  Myofibroblasts (MFB) play a central role in the initiation and perpetuation of fibrosis []
 While identification of the IPF-initiating cells remains to be discovered HSCs are the major cell types contributing to both liver inflammation and liver fibrosis []
 Although fibrogenic signature proteins such as Collagens, CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) or Periostin have been well elucidated, full spectrum of fibrogenic proteins have yet to be discovered
 Nevertheless, several anti-fibrotic modalities have continually put on clinical studies []
 Although fibrosis is not defined an immune disorder, inflammatory cells are believed to be responsible for eliciting fibrogenic signaling

 As seen in Supplementary Figure 2, ONG41008 was rapidly detected from the plasma, lung, liver or When ONGHEPA1 (mouse HSC cels) or DHLF (diseased human lung fibroblasts from IPF patients) were stimulated with TGF, expression of SMA (-smooth muscle actinin) was notable but was then substantially mitigated with the treatment of ONG41008 (Figure 1A for ONGHEPA1 and Supplementary Figure 3 for DHLF)
 Likewise, other fibrinogenic markers involving Collagen11, Collagen111 or Periostin was induced by TGF and were knocked down by ONG41008, suggesting that ONG41008 may directly act on pathogenic myofibroblasts (pMFP) both in the lung or liver fibrotic tissues
 ONG41008 markedly inhibited phosphorylation of both SMAD2 and SMAD3, suggesting that phosphorylated Smad2 and/or Smad3 may translocate to the nucleus, activating fibrogenesis

 While a massive actin depolymerization was observed with the treatment of ONG41008 no such depolymerization was seen in ONGHEAPA1 cells stimulated with pirfenidone or nintedanib, suggesting that the latter two anti-IPF drugs have little or no effects on F-actin depolymerization
 In vitro actin polymerization or depolymerization assay was established and showed that ONG41008 was, indeed, an inhibitor of actin polymerization (Figure 1D) as well as an enhancer of actin depolymerization (Figure E)
 It has well been appreciated that osteoclasts exist as fused states whereby the O-ring made of F-actin surrounds the fused osteoclasts called multinucleated osteoclasts []

 LTC plays a central role of TGF biogenesis [18], releasing active TGF, which is then engaged in the TGFRI/TGFRII complex, giving rise to phosphorylation of induced and secreted into the extra cellular matrix (ECM) compartments with the treatment of TGF, but LTBP4 appears to be either only partially affected or unaffected by ONG41008 (Figure A)

 Many of these have been already known to be fibrogenic genes such as CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), PERIOSTIN, LOX (lysyl oxidase), or N-cadherin (CDH2) [-]
 Elastin (Eln) gene expression has been appreciated that ELASTIN is prefibrotic and represents progress of fibrosis
 And it is known to be an EMT gene [22, ]
 Clear indication is that Eln gene expression was substantially induced with TGF and was knocked down with ONG41008 whose IC50 was 194 nM (Supplementary Figure A)
 In line with this, secreted ELN protein from DHLF was significantly inhibited with ONG41008 (Supplementary Figure B)
 NOX4, a NADPH oxidase, caught our attention because induction of NOX4 has been reported for production of pronounced reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as for elicitation of several important signaling events like inflammasome activation []
 To scrutinize whether ONG41008 is able to suppress induction of NOX4, thereby kinetics of NOX4 along with Collagen111 and Periostin were analyzed at transcription levels
 As shown in Figure 4A, NOX4 mRNA was gradually induced by TGF and ONG41008 was able to block the induction, suggesting that ONG41008 may be able to inhibit NOX4 at transcription levels
 Production of ROS was also significantly attenuated, which is shown by immunocytochemistry (ICC) (Figure B)

 To have a deeper understanding on a potential mechanism of cell reversion, we established a series of continual differentiation experiments by using ONGHEPA1, which could be a unique in vitro model, in such a way that morphological changes as well as interactome changes were established by stimulating ONGHEPA1 cells with TGF for 24 hr after which the resultant myofibroblasts were washed off with buffer and were subjected to TGF plus ONG41008 or ONG41008 alone (data not shown) for 48 hr because the combinatorial treatment seemed to be more pertinent to in vivo situation
 The treated cells were re-plated out and continually were stimulated with TGF alone for 72 hr
 Upon completion of initial transdifferentiation, myofibroblasts into an intermediate cell type
 Moreover, these intermediate cells seemed to be situated in quiescence since no conspicuous cell growth was observed
 We extended our question to see if these quiescent cells can be again transdifferentiated to myofibroblasts with the treatment of TGF alone
 We discovered that transdifferentiation resumed at least 48 hr after TGF stimulation, suggesting that this reversion process should be a flexible differentiation program in vitro

 As shown in Figure 5B, a hybrid interactomes existed in the reversion process; 1) fibrogenic interactome and 2) reversion interactome
 The former involves chemokines, collagens, adhesins or enzymes, and ECM biogenic factors as shown in Supplementary Figure 
 The latter is apparently composed of a minor residual fibrogenic interactome and a major nuclear reprograming one
 The residual fibrogenic interactome seems to be linked to the major nuclear programming via linking the Spp1(Secreted Phosphoprotein 1)-Egr1(Early Growth Response 1) axis (the former one) and the MKI67 (marker of proliferation Ki-67)-Birc5 (Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 5) in the latter one

 Taken together, the  Therapeutic efficacy of ONG41008 for lung fibrosis was analyzed via a mouse therapeutic BLM
 A greatest reduction in collagen production was observed at ONG41008 50 or 100mpk, whereas no significant inhibition was noted at ONG41008 10mpk as well as at pirfenidone 100mpk (Figure 6A), suggesting that larger exposure of ONG41008 may be needed to cope with existing lung fibrosis in therapeutic model
 While production of hydroxy proline (HP) at 10mpk or 50mpk of ONG41008 only exhibited reduction tendency 100mpk significantly inhibited HP production with a statistical significance (Figure B)
 Pirfenidone did not generate reduction in both collagen and HP with statistical significances
 Expression of SMA were more significantly decreased in the ONG41008-treated mice than control mice
 However, dexamethasone did not affect SMA staining, indicating that anti-inflammation may not be able to mitigate proliferation of myofibroblasts at advanced stages (Figure C)

 Pirfenidone exhibited a moderate reduction in both cases
 Pirfenidone only gave rise to decreasing tendencies in reduction of soluble collagen or HP staining whereas dexamethasone was unable to improve the disease severity (Supplementary Figure C)
 Taken together, ONG41008 could be a good candidate for treating IPF as a ONG41008 is a potent inhibitor of innate immunity in that it could be a TNF antagonist It has been lately reported that knocking out TNF negatively affects steatosis or NFALD score []
 Since we only explored a potent anti-inflammatory capability associated with ONG41008 in HSC or DHLF in TGF-dependent manner, a natural question would be whether its anti-inflammatory property can be extended to macrophages in response to LPS stimulation in the absence of TGF

7 cells, a mouse monocytic leukemic cell line resembling macrophages, were stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of ONG
 As shown in Figure 8A, expression of proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines including TNF, CCL2, CCL7, CXCL2 and CXCL10 were markedly downregulated by ONG
 Interestingly, CHOP was so markedly reduced that formation of inflammasome could be attenuated [-]
 However, no statistically significant repression of IL6 or IL23 was made (data not shown)

 It strongly indicates that ONG41008 may inhibit formation of a TLR4-LPS binding proteome or signalosome such as CD14, MD-2 or Myd88 []
 This prompted us to explore intracellular trafficking of these proteins upon LPS stimulation
 As shown Figure 8A, LPS induced the internalization of CD14 and Myd88, whereas ONG1008 CD14 and significantly attenuated of endocytosis of Myd
 Magnified views on these ICC further clearly revealed that ONG41008 blocked the internalization of CD14 to endocytic compartments (Supplementary Figure )
 On the contrary, MD-2 and NOX4 remained largely unaltered (Supplementary Figure )
 An interactome regulating the LPS-ONG41008 axis in macrophages was established based on an RNA-Seq
 To our surprise, TNF turned out to be the central nod of the interactome, strongly suggesting that ONG41008 may play a central role   Summing up all these observations, we believe that ONG41008 is an endocytosis inhibitor of CD14, remarkably diminishing macrophage activation

 We recently found that a few CSD are capable of attenuating in vitro fibrogenesis and in vivo fibrosis []
 Slight modification of functional groups linked to CSD severely affected degree of anti-fibrosis, suggesting that medicinal chemistry would be able to improve their therapeutic efficacy
 One drawback associated with CSD in terms of in vivo use for treating fibrosis is that CSD administered into rodents largely used to undergo glucuronidation
 We confirmed that glucuronide form of CSD completely lost the anti-fibrotic capacity in vitro (data not shown)
 Thus, development of the analogs coping with this impairment should be implemented
 ONG41008 rendered non-toxic when subjected to non-GLP toxicity
 PK profiles using rats or beagle dogs via oral administration were readily detectable
 In many senses, ONG41008 could The major MOA seems to be able to dismantle LTC in such a way that ONG41008 limits binding of the active TGF to TGFRs; one major manifestation is blocking phosphorylation of SMAD2/SMAD3, resulting in disabling type 2 EMT so called fibrogenesis
 However, phosphorylation of ERK was not affected by ONG41008, suggesting that ONG41008 is largely associated with the main signaling of TGFR, i

 Nevertheless, how ONG41008 initiates this reversion process remains to be determined in order to discover a molecular target for a central role by ONG
  Crucial role of TNF associated with liver diseases prompted us to scrutinize effect of ONG41008 on macrophage physiology
 Macrophages play a central role in inflammation whose activation has been known to be modulated by ROS []
 As ONG41008 mitigated NOX4 gene expression in DHLF as well as in ONGHEPA1 (HSC) cells, how ONG41008 regulates NOX4 gene expression in ONGHEPA1 cells remained intriguing
 As anticipated, ONG41008 was able to greatly attenuate NOX4 transcription along with Collagen111 or that ONG41008 may affect macrophage homing to the liver
 This data suggests that NOX4 plays an important role in pathogenesis of myofibroblasts
 According to an interactome analysis shown in Figure 3, NOX4 seems to be functionally related to endothelin (EDN) 1, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP)
 HSC play a pivotal role in hepatic inflammation as well as liver fibrosis [36, ]
 Macrophage infiltration is pathologically related to steatosis or liver inflammation []
 ONG41008 seemed to be able to block the endocytosis of CD14, one of the main LPS receptors or Myd88, disarming TLR4-driven TNF production
 Although our confocal imaging analysis may set a working hypothesis that ONG4100 may directly bind to CD14, more analytical interaction studies should be performed like DART (direct analysis in real time) as a mass spectrometry
