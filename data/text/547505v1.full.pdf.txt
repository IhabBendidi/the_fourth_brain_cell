 ;    Altered patterns of visual social attention preference detected using eye-tracking and a variety of different paradigms are increasingly proposed as sensitive biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder
 However, few eye tracking studies have compared the with typically developing children and their sensitivity to specific symptoms
 To target this issue, the current study used three common eye tracking protocols contrasting social versus non-social stimuli in young (2-7 years old) Chinese autistic (n = 35) and typically developing (n = 34) children matched for age and gender
 (dynamic light point walking human or cat) vs
 non-biological motion (scrambled controls) and child playing with toy vs
 toy alone
 Although all three paradigms dynamic geometry pattern paradigm was the most effective, with autistic children preference in autistic children was correlated with the ADOS social affect score and had the highest discrimination accuracy
 Our results therefore indicate that decreased visual preference for dynamic social stimuli may be the most effective visual attention-based paradigm for use as a biomarker for autism in Chinese children
 Eye-tracking measures may be useful in aiding diagnosis and treatment of autism, although it is unclear which specific tasks are optimal Here we compare the ability of three different social eye-gaze tasks to discriminate between autistic and typically developing young Chinese children and their sensitivity to specific autistic symptoms
 Our results show that a dynamic task comparing visual preference for social (individuals dancing) versus geometric patterns is the most effective both for was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 The prevalence of ASD has increased to 1/59 according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States [Christensen et al, 2016], although estimates vary considerably worldwide with 1/38 in South Korea [Kim et al, 2011] and 1/255 in China [Wang et al, ]
 While ASD twin studies have demonstrated a strong genetic contribution to ASD with heritability estimates ranging between 64% and 91% [Tick, Bolton, Happ, Rutter, & Rijsdijk, 2016], no reliable genotype biomarker is current available
 Thus, the current ASD diagnostics rely entirely on the assessment of behavioral symptoms based on two tools used for diagnosing of ASD is the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule [ADOS-2; Lord, Luyster, Gotham, & Guthrie, 2012; Lord et al, 2012] which is Randolph, & Farmer, 2008] and used in both clinical and research fields
 The symptoms of social interest deficits (eg
 social eye contact, social facial expressions and social motion) have been treated as important hallmarks of autism and used as diagnostic criteria in ADOS-2 [Lord et al 2012] as well as questionnaire-based assessments such as the Autism Diagnostic Interview [ADI-R - Rutter, Le Couteur, & Lord, 2003] and the social responsiveness scale [SRS - Constantino & Gruber ]
 of social interest deficits are required to increase diagnostic accuracy and evaluate the Given the symptoms of social interest deficits in ASD, eye-tracking technology in particular has facilitated research in investigating altered social attentional biases in autistic individuals of all ages

 Subsequent studies have further developed the use of biomarkers for ASD compared with typically developing (TD) controls primarily by contrasting visual attention towards social as opposed to non-social stimuli
 Overall, they have shown that individuals with ASD tend to show reduced attentional Tanaka, Saito, Kosaka, & Tomoda, 2014; Klin, Lin, Gorrindo, Ramsay, & Jones, 2009; Moore et al, 2018; Pierce, Marinero, Hazin, Mckenna, & Barnes, 2015; Shi et al, 2015] and biological motion [Atkinson, 2009; Jones et al, 2011; Koldewyn, Whitney, & Rivera, 2010; Murphy, Brady, Fitzgerald, & Troje, 2009; Rutherford & Troje, 2012; Saygin, Cook, & Blakemore, ]
 However, not all studies have reported positive are often hampered by small sample sizes [Atkinson, 2009; Jones et al, 2011; Koldewyn, Whitney, & Rivera, 2010; Murphy, Brady, Fitzgerald, & Troje, 2009; paradigms contrasting preference for social and non-social stimuli and the majority have also primarily involved Caucasian children
 In the current study we have therefore compared the efficacy of three different protocols for firstly discriminating between young Chinese children with ASD compared with TD controls and secondly their sensitivity to ASD symptoms quantified by ADOS-
 The three protocols chosen were firstly attention to dynamic geometric patterns versus individual dancing humans [Pierce et al, 2015; adapted to incorporate Chinese stimuli]; secondly a classical biological motion protocol (dynamic light point walking human (or cat) versus a scrambled control version) [Rutherford & Troje, 2012] and thirdly an adaptation of protocols [Chevallier et al, 2015; Frazier et al, 2018] investigating attentional bias towards children playing with a toy as opposed to the toy itself

 The 34 TD children were recruited from a local kindergarten by advertisement
 The age and gender of the final ASD and TD groups were matched
 All children, including the TD group, were assessed using a series of questionnaire-based measures including the Questionnaire [Rutter et al, 2003] (SCQ) completed by one of their caregivers
 Table 1 shows demographic and questionnaire scores for the ASD and TD groups and ADOS-2 scores for the ASD group
 The study was pre-registered as a clinical trial at Three eye-tracking paradigms were included in this study
 The first paradigm is a Dynamic Visual Preference Task (Task 1) displaying dynamic dancing Chinese human versus dynamic geometry patterns

 Participants were presented with a movie consisting of two rectangular areas of interest which portrayed a single Chinese child or adult dancing on one side and a dynamic geometrical image on the other side (30 different pairs of images were each presented for 2 s and in a continuous sequence)

 There was a jittered interval (mean=3 s) between each pair of stimuli where a yellow star was displayed in the center of screen For the experiment children were either seated alone or on a caregivers lap in front of the presentation screen
 A Tobii TX300 Binocular Eye Tracker used together with Tobii Studio software (version 
 
8 Tobii, Stockholm, Sweden) to record visual attention and E-prime linked with the Tobii software used for stimulus presentation
 The Tobii system used an I-VT fixation filter
 The mean of the right and left eyes was used to calculate fixation
 The eye-tracking monitor (TFT-LCD; 23", 19201080) had a refresh rate of 60 Hz
 Brightness was 100 % and a five-point calibration procedure was used at the beginning of each experiment
 The calibration process was repeated if the initial calibration quality was poor
 The total duration of the experimental tasks was around 5 min, with short breaks in between each task
  Social attention was quantified as the mean proportion of total fixation time children spent on looking at the social (vs
 non-social) stimuli
 This is a widely and uniformly reported measure in eye-tracking studies and meta-analyses [Frazier et al, 2018; Meia In Task 1, the proportion of total fixation time for children in the ASD and TD groups was investigated in each of the two rectangular areas of interest showing the dynamic social (DSI) and geometric (DGI) images
 The proportion of the total fixation time on DSI was used as the dependent variable
 In accordance with previous studies [Moore et al, 2018; Pierce et al, 2011, 2015], the dependent variable was calculated as follows: Total looking time = time spent on DSI + time spent on DGI; % was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 Additionally, we measured the proportion of fixation counts and mean fixation durations between the different areas of interest
 Childrens data was only included for analysis in this paradigm where they spent >40% of the time looking at the areas of interest [see Frazier et al, ]
 In Task 2, the areas of interest were the two rectangular regions displaying the animate and inanimate light point videos
 The proportion of the total fixation time on human stimuli (HBM) and cat stimuli (CBM) were calculated as follows: % of total fixation time on nonsocial animation = time spent on the cat animation/ (time spent on the cat animation + time spent on the scrambled cat stimulus control)  100; % of total fixation time on social animation= time spent on the human animation/ (time spent on the human animation + time spent on the scrambled human stimulus control)  
 Fixation counts and durations were also measured
 For this task children needed to spend >15% of the time looking at the areas of interest to be included in the analysis, In Task 3, the two rectangular area of interest regions included the boy playing with toy region (Social) and toy only (Nonsocial) one
 Additionally, we also calculated fixation time on the boys face (Face) and the toy in the picture with the boy (Toy1) and the toy in the picture without the boy (Toy)
 The proportion of the total fixation times were calculated as follows: % total fixation time on boy playing toy = (time spent on the boy playing with toy / total looking time on both rectangular areas of interest)  100; % total fixation time on boys face = (time spent on face/ time spent at both rectangular areas of interest)  100; % total fixation time on toy with boy = (time spent on the toy with boy / total looking time on both rectangular areas of interest)  100; % total fixation to toy without boy = (time spent on the toy without boy/ total looking time on both rectangular areas of interest)  
 In addition, % time looking at the boys face compared to Toy 1 and % time looking at Toy 1 compared to Toy 2 were calculated

 For Tasks 2 and 3, 2-way ANOVAs were used to compare multiple variables followed by total fixation duration and fixation counts and mean individual fixation durations to the different stimuli and ADOS-2 scores was conducted using Pearson correlation analysis
 All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS-
 Effect sizes (partial eta-squared, 2 p for F statistics and Cohens d for t-tests) were reported with P-values analyses were used for investigating the ability of specific parameters in the three tasks for discriminating between the ASD and TD groups in order to compare the A total of 3 children in the ASD were excluded from analysis due to problems with eye-tracking data collection and in Tasks 2 and 3, 6 and 12 children respectively in the ASD group had to be excluded from analysis due to viewing the screen for < 15% of the time

 ;    The main objective of the current study was to compare and contrast the relative discriminating between Chinese ASD and TD children and secondly to show a our results show that a Chinese version of the dynamic dancing individuals versus (Pierce et al, 2011; 2015) was the most effective both for showing differences between ASD and TD children (with both large effect sizes and areas under the ROC curve) and for demonstrating associations with the severity of social affect symptoms
 Importantly as well, all the ASD children paid attention to the display screen for almost the whole of the period of the task whereas in the other two tasks used many of them did not and had to be excluded
 As such this specific dynamic task may be particularly suitable and sensitive for aiding both diagnosis and assessing social affect  In line with many previous studies [Moore et al, 2018; Pierce et al, 2011, 2015] children in the ASD group generally spent less time looking at the display screen than ones in the TD group and thus the most effective measure for group comparisons is the relative proportion of time spent viewing one stimulus compared with another
 Indeed, in accordance with the original definition autistic children tend to shut out anything that comes to them from outside [Kanner, 1943], and therefore pay less, or an altered pattern of, visual attention to environment cues (including social and nonsocial) than TD children
 Autistic individuals also tend to exhibit an enhanced self-focus [Burrows, Laird, & Uddin, 2016; Vasudeva & Hollander, 2017], it can result in reduced external attention
 In the dynamic dancing versus geometric image task none of the ASD children needed to be excluded for insufficient attention (and with a higher threshold of >40%) to the display screen with the remainder looking at the screen on average for 89% of the time compared with 98% in TD children

3% (Task 2) and 
6% (Task 3) of the time looking at the screen compared with 
1% and 
8% in TD children
 In these latter two tasks inattention was particularly during the jittered fixation intervals between stimuli which are not included in Task 1, and this suggests that such routine fixation periods may need to be dynamic dancing versus geometric stimuli task is clearly very effective in gaining the attention of both ASD and TD children, which further underlines its utility
      In agreement with previous studies on Caucasian children (Franchini et al, 2017; Moore et al, 2018; Pierce et al, 2011; 2015) in the Dynamic Visual Preference Task ASD children show a greater attentional preference for dynamic geometrical patterns compared with individuals dancing/exercising whereas in TD children the opposite is the case
 The strong association we found between the reduced interest in the dynamic social stimuli and the severity of social deficits in ASD is also in agreement with studies in Caucasian children
 Importantly, both of these findings are not restricted to specific stimulus sets since those we used were different to ones in other previous studies
 In the current study both the proportion of total fixation duration and also of fixation counts were sensitive measures but not mean durations of individual fixations
 Thus children with ASD spend proportionately less time looking at the DSI because they show a reduced number of fixations to them rather and a reduced duration of individual fixations
 It is possible that specific types of dynamic geometrical images may be more attractive than others to ASD individuals and that varying the number of individuals and type of movements they exhibit might also increase their attractiveness to TD individuals
 A small-scale study for example found that displaying multiple dancing individuals was more effective than only one [Shi et al, ]
 If so, then additional refinements to this paradigm might serve to further While a number of previous studies have reported than ASD individuals show et al, 2012; Falck-Ytter et al, 2013; Wang et al, 2015] we did not replicate this in the was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 Indeed, ASD children were generally attracted by biological motion and even significantly more so that TD ones for the cat stimulus
 Although this latter group different had a reasonable ability to discriminate between ASD and TD children (ROC area under the curve of 
69) it was not associated with symptom severity
 The only other difference was that TD children were significantly more interested in human than cat stimuli whereas ASD ones showed equivalent interest in them
 Our findings with this paradigm are in line with a recent study that individuals with ASD can be more sensitive to the biological motion and both ASD and the TD groups are able to detect the perceptual information [Rosanna et al, ]
 Many other studies have also failed to demonstrate significant differences between ASD and TD children using versions of this biological motion paradigm [Atkinson, 2009; Jones et al, 2011; Koldewyn, Whitney & Rivera, 2010; Murphy et al, 2009; Saygin, Cook, & Blakemore, ]
 Thus, our overall conclusion is that this protocol in its current format may not be sufficiently robust for use as an ASD marker
  Our findings using an adapted version of Static Visual Preference Task (Task 3) indicated that although there was no visual preference difference between the two groups for the face of the child playing with the toy, the ASD group spent proportionately less time looking at the toy the boy was holding in his hand
 This could indicate that ASD children were less motivated to share the interest of the child in the picture for the toy
 This pattern of altered preference also showed a reasonable ability to discriminate between ASD and TD individuals (ROC area under the curve of 
67), however as with the biological motion paradigm findings it showed no failed to pay sufficient attention to the screen during the paradigm which make it In summary, our findings comparing the efficacy of three different eye-tracking paradigms as a marker for ASD in young Chinese children, together with the severity of its social symptoms have emphasized the utility of the dynamic paradigm appears to be effective both across cultures and stimulus sets and possibly further was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
