 Objectives: Using acustomized definition of EF and a new clinical paradigm, we performed a prospectivediagnostic accuracy trial to assess the diagnostic value of several fractal measures fromthe thinking processes or inferences in a cohort of ADHD children and typically devel-oping controls
 Method: We included children from age five to twelve diagnosed witha reference standard based on case history, physical and neurological examination,Conners 3rd Edition, and DSM-VTM
 The index test consisted of a computer-basedinference task with a set of eight different instances of the Battleships game to besolved
 A consecutive series of 18 cases and 18 controls (n = 36) recruited at theprimary paediatrics service from the Nelson Marlborough Health in New Zealand un-derwent the reference standard and the index test
 Several fractal measures wereobtained from the inference task to produce supervised classification models
 Res-eight games played by each children yielded a 100% classification accuracy, sensitivityand specificity in both a training and an independent testing/validating cohort
 Con-clusions: From a translational vantage point the expeditious method and the robustresults make this technique a promising candidate to develop a screening, diagnosticand monitoring system for ADHD, and may serve to assess other EF disturbances

 The exact aetiology of ADHD remains unknownis complicated and of a limited success (Armstrong and Lezak, )
 Nonethe-(Hamza et al, 2017; Bhat et al, )
 ADHD is a major diagnostic challengefor clinicians; no useful bio-markers or gold standard diagnostic tests are avail-able to date (Scassellati et al, 2012; Thome et al, 2012; Rothenberger et al,The current diagnosis of ADHD is performed in a subjective manner bywithstanding, it has been estimated that around 20% of those diagnoses couldbe mistaken (Elder, 2010; Merten et al, 2017), and hence in recent decades alarge amount of translational research in medicine has been carried out tryingto devise an objective technology for ADHD diagnosis
 Many of the most sali-ent and promising efforts to identify cognitive biomarkers for ADHD rest on theassessment of a controversial construct that has been labelled executive functionThe main reason for targeting EF as a potential source of knowledge to betranslated into a diagnostic tool, is that children with ADHD have revealeda pattern of cognitive deficits consistent with pre-frontal EF deficits, namelyivity), restlessness or hyperactivity, or in some cases apathy (Inagaki, )
Despite the controversy and the more than 30 definitions of the concept of EF(Goldstein and Naglieri, 2013), the currently accepted view refers to a wideset of more or less independent higher order cognitive processes and abilities

 ;    The poorly defined boundaries and the lack of a unified and integrativedefinition of the concept of EF makes initial translational steps very hard tocedures to assess this construct in experimental and clinical settings (Goldsteinand Naglieri, )
 Most of the outcomes from these procedures and tech-niques have been deficient and of limited success (Hall et al, 2016; Lange et al,)
 It seems that the dual issues of (i) a lack of a proper definition and (ii)operationalization of the EF concept present a challenge to the use of measuresof EF for the ADHD diagnosis at the individual level that is unsurmontable(Faraone et al, )
 For example, none of the existing theoretical constructsand their associated procedures to evaluate EF could account for the heterogen-eity of ADHD clinical presentation
 As a consequence they have never producedacceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity in any ADHD diagnostic accuracyThe concept of EF, although not the term itself, originated in the formerThis notion was born rooted in Anokhins theory of Functional Systems (An-in the brain (Luria, 1966, 1976, )
 This conceptual synthesis was usedby Luria to analyse the disturbances of higher cortical functions produced bylocal brain lesions
 Lurias work on frontal lobe and dysexecutive syndromewas crucial to differentiate EF from other aspects of cognitive processes (Luria,1976, )
 During the 80s the cognitive revolution took over this construct,As a result of this translation the concept was fragmented and detached from itsbeen the dominant perspective that frames most of the EF views (cf
 Shalliceet al,)
 Moreover this frame is the official doctrine that determines howthis construct is currently understood and assessed for ADHD diagnosis
 Con-sequently, most of the practical methods for assessing EF for an ADHD diagnosisunder the cognitive paradigm rest on measures of performance or achievement(Goldstein and Naglieri, 2013; Griffin et al, 2015; Hoskyn et al, 2017) of theindividuals from different particular cognitive domains and are based in openloop tasks (Marken, 1988, )
 To the best of our knowledge no integrat-ive measures have been produced that could account for the mechanisms andthe regulatory aspect of EF across the different cognitive domains and using awas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    When looking for a common feature that could subserve all the diverse ele-ments, behaviours or cognitive operations that has been put under the umbrellaof the EF concept, the first point to notice, is that all of them are manifestationsof goal-directed behaviours
 The second is that all these goal-directed activitiesare powered and driven by inferential processes (in a wide sense, i
 e
, at present-from the very basic sensorimotor levels, as in unconscious innate reflex actions;right up to the highest goal-directed conscious cognitive activities (Peirce, ;Piaget et al, 2013; Labra-Sprhnle, a)
 The fundamental role of the inferen-of any goal directed behaviour is paramount in the theory of functional systems(Anokhin, 1974) and in the theory of inferences from Peirce (1998), and Piaget()
 The convergence of these theories inspired one of us to develop in detailof this definition for the current work are that EF can be viewed as a cycleof inferential processes that are central to behaviour and cognition
 Besides,differences in EF between individuals, including EF disorders, could be revealedlection and decision making (Matthies et al, 2012a; Schepman et al, a,b),impaired in in ADHD individuals (Guevara and Stein, )
 In spite of the factthat inferential processes are at the core of EF, represented in decision makingChevalier et al, 2017; Blair and Ursache, 2011; Sella et al, 2012; Mowinckelet al, 2015), those processes have not previously been directly targeted for EFWe suggest here that there is a gap in knowledge at the nexus of EF, infer-ential processes, and ADHD, caused by the lack of a theoretical synthesis thatcould integrate different domains of knowledge and the clinical facts associatedto these concepts
 This circumstance has led to a two-fold methodological defi-ciency: firstly the absence of an empirical model of human inferential processes,and secondly the absence of an experimental paradigm to assess them
 From atranslational point of view, these limitations has been hindering the conversionof basic knowledge into a clinical technology for the diagnosis and managementwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 The main objective of these studies is to determine if anew technology has any diagnostic value, it is the first step during the valida-for choosing the participants sample is that if the new technology cannot dis-tinguish the sickest from the wellest individuals, then there is no need tocontinue with the new technology assessment (Zhou et al, )
 For the pur-poses of this trial and according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofbe considered as the sickest presentation of the syndrome
 Complementary tothis distinction, typically developing children could be labelled as the wellestDespite that the treatment and analysis of the data gathered for this re-search is strongly guided by a machine learning approach to predictive mod-et al, 2018), this research consider statistic control(Miller and Chapman, )for the potential confounding factors, age and gender including them as inputfeatures (co-variates) in the predictive models
 This choice is supported by em-pirical facts that shows that including them as features eventually could producebetter classification models, and no extra effort is required to collect this dataduring the clinical interview (Rao et al, 2015, )
 Measures of intelligencelike IQ scores were not included, due to the fact that strong logical, statisticaland methodological arguments have been raised against this practise in studiesof neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in ADHD (Dennis et al, 2009; Ba-yard et al, )
 Besides, the marginal predictive power that IQ scores couldbring to the classification models does not justify their inclusion, due to the clin-ical cost in terms of time and the extra work required to collect this measures
From a translational point of view, this additional cost could become a strongdeterrent to the future clinical inception of this kind of diagnostic procedures

 The ori-ginal objective of the game is to find and sink all of the other players hiddenships before they sink all of your ships
 This requires the players to devise theirown battleship positions while guessing that of the other players
 Our versionof the game has been designed to be played by only one player at a time

 Lacunarity analysis is a fractal technique fordescribing patterns of temporal and spatial dispersion
 This method is widelyapplicable to many data set used in the human and natural sciences
 Althoughoriginally developed for mono-fractal objects, the method in its general form, canbe used to describe multifractal patterns
 (Plotnick et al, )
 This methodcan be applied to data of any dimensionality and from multiples sources
 Itallows the description of scale dependent changes in spatial and temporal struc-tures, by these means it can give insights of the dynamic of underlying processes
The technique has been implemented in several packages for image and signalThe gliding-box procedure for lacunarity estimation can be describes as fol-lows: a box of length r is placed at the origin of one of the images

 The task of producing logistic regres-sion models was performed using the R package caret implemented by KuhnFeatures selection Using the full set of variables, the selection of predictorsfor the models was performed using the R package fscaret (Automated FeatureSelection from caret (Szlk, 2016)) and the models were further tuned manu-ally using a forward selection strategy (the departing model always includedvariables age and sex) to get the highest values of AUC (ROC) in the trainingControl for the confounding variables age and sex To prevent residual con-founding, due to the unknown type of association (linear or non linear) betweenthe confounding variables (age and sex) and the outcome from the classificationmodels, control for both confounding were performed
 The adjustment for thecontinuous confounding variable age, was done by means of stratification in five(Groenwold et al, 2013; Cochran, )
 The categories of age in years rangedwas included as a co-variate factor in the predictive models
 The main reasonfor controlling for age using stratification in categories is due to the fact that theunderlying processes of cognitive development are not continuous and they canrise or decline at different ages (Werner, )
 For the confounding variablesex, a dichotomous category was used and also included as a co-variate factoracy, sensitivity, specificity and the ROC AUC (Swets, )

 The cause for this drop out in the controlgroup happens because the participant were performing the test during lunchtime break, with a restrictive amount of time to fulfill the whole task composedby 8 games
 In the cases group, two drop outs were due to malfunction of therecording software, and two by the negative of the child to finish the full task

 From the first review,twelve cognitive domains could be identified, these domains corresponds to themain constructs abstracted from the diverse tools and methods employed toand working memory
 The second review presented and analysed works in-tended to functionally map the former domains onto different brain structures
These two reviews are exemplar in presenting the main tenets of the mainstreamvoted to investigate ADHD and EF

 In this manner thestage was set for the coming years of the EF conceptual controversies (morethan thirty definitions have been produce since then) and the vibrant, diversebut puzzling EF research performed by the mainstream cognitive scientist
 Un-der the cognitivist paradigm, the notion of EF was disconnected from its originaltransplanted to a modular and computational view of cognition (Fodor, ;Carruthers, )
 In this framework, EF was fragmented in diverse separatebrain networks in which one is the seat of a central control (Uttal, 2003; Perler,the concept of EF, with poor or null operational character without reaching con-sensus (Barkley, )
 As a consequence the methodological aspect and theexperimental expression of EF models were downgraded in their validity andand despite its revolutionary conceptual shift, the practitioners of the newparadigm kept attached to the same old style and tools of experimental testing,i
 e
, the open-loop causal model of behaviour and mental functioning (Marken,For an informed reader it comes as no surprise that most of the objectivemethods found in the current literature, aimed to help in the ADHD diagnosisand EF assessment, and that were reviewed for this research, are based or in-models oriented to get performance measures (Griffin et al, 2015; Hoskynet al, )

 It isimportant to bear in mind what Labra-Sprhnle (2017) and Gigerenzer ()comparisons between tests may be the optimal procedure; only indirect, curs-ory comparisons were possible at this stage
 The selected comparing metricsbetween tests were their accuracy, sensitive and specificity

 This review included other exist-ing methods proposed to diagnose ADHD, that were not covered in the formersystematic review
 To make the indirect comparison possible, this in-house scop-ing review included only diagnostic accuracy studies that reported the chosenrelated potentials (Marcano et al, 2017; Loo et al, 2016; Snyder et al, ;Mohammadi et al, 2016; Gloss et al, 2016; Biederman et al, 2017; Gammaand Kara, 2016; Marcano et al, 2018; Manouilenko et al, 2017), structuraland functional neuroimaging (Iannaccone et al, 2015; Rangarajan et al, ;de Celis Alonso et al, 2017; Qureshi et al, 2017; Serrallach et al, 2016; Hasaneenet al, 2017; Tan et al, 2017b; Uddin et al, 2017), simulated virtual reality andcomputer games (Negut et al, 2017, 2016; Berger et al, 2017; Faraone et al,2016), and peripheral biochemical markers (Faraone et al, 2014; Scassellati andBonvicini, 2015; Scassellati et al, 2012; Thome et al, )

All these features are highly desirable for a test in a clinic situation
An additional strength of the present study is its adherence to the STARDguidelines in reporting the classification performance of the models trialled (Bos-In general terms, in a phase I and II of a diagnostic accuracy study, the lim-itations are directly related with the scope of the questions posed, and theadequacy of the methods employed to answer them (Knottnerus and Buntinx,)

From a translational vantage point, the technology presented here makes ita promising candidate to further develop a screening, diagnostic and monitoringsystem for ADHD(Faraone et al, 2014; Thome et al, 2012), due to its straight-non-invasive nature
 Another asset of this technology is that potentially couldbe easily adapted to assess other EF disorders
