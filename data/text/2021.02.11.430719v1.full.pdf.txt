 ;    Objective
 Polygenic prediction of type 2 diabetes in continental Africans is adversely affected by the limited number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of type 2 diabetes from Africa, and the poor transferability of European derived polygenic risk scores (PRS) in diverse ethnicities
 We set out to evaluate if African American or multi-ethnic Research Design and Methods
 Using the PRSice software, ethnic-specific PRSs were computed with weights from the type 2 diabetes GWAS of the Million Veteran Program (MVP) study
 The  South African Zulu study (1602 cases and 976 controls) was used as the target data set
 Replication and assessment of the best predictive PRS association with age at diagnosis was done in the Africa America Diabetes Mellitus (AADM) study (1031 cases and Results
 The African American derived PRS was more predictive of type 2 diabetes compared to the European and multi-ethnic derived scores
 Notably, participants in the 10th decile of this PRS had a 
19-fold greater risk (OR 
19; 95%CI (

29), p = 
33 x10-6) of developing diabetes and were diagnosed 
6 years earlier compared to those in the first Conclusions African American derived PRS enhances polygenic prediction of type 2 (including Africans) in GWAS, promises to provide better tools for precision medicine (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus in 2019 was estimated to be 463 million individuals(1), of which 
4 million are from Africa and 90% of them had type 2 diabetes
 African countries are adversely affected by limited resources to manage this burden
 Nonetheless, by 2045 it is projected that Africa will experience the largest increase of diabetes prevalence in the world of 143% (1; )
 In addition, the highest proportion of undiagnosed (
7%) people living with diabetes in the world reside in Africa()
 Therefore, urgent strategies and resources for improving screening and early identification interventions Type 2 diabetes is a multifactorial disease, that is hypothesised to be increasing in prevalence due to the interaction of genetic and environmental factors()
 Although the genetic factors are stable overtime, the surge in diabetes prevalence over the past decades is thought to be caused by urbanization, and adoption of westernized lifestyles characterised by consumption of energy dense foods and physical inactivity(3; )
 However, diabetes has been noted to be preventable and its onset delayed for 15 years by diet and exercise interventions in the Diabetes Prevention Program()
 Since diet and exercise strategies are readily accessible and relatively low-cost, coupling these lifestyle interventions with approaches that identify people more susceptible to develop diabetes earlier, might effectively lower the diabetes burden
 The use of polygenic risk scores for early identification of people that are more genetically susceptible to develop type 2 diabetes is such an approach()
 Recent studies conducted in Europeans have indicated that individuals in the 10th decile have 
21-fold higher risk (OR=
21; 95% CI 
 
49) of developing diabetes compared to those in the first decile()
 However, evidence exists of the poor transferability European derived polygenic scores in (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    diverse populations
 For example, Martin et al 2019 reported that European PRSs had a 
-fold reduced predictive in Africans Americans across 17 traits
 There is a now a concern that African ancestry and other similarly under-studied population groups may not benefit from the clinical translation efforts of these risk polygenic scores and thereby further exacerbate Large multi-ethnic cohorts such as the Million Veteran Program improve the representation of African Americans in GWAS and offer a promise of improved polygenic prediction in this group ()
 However, the representation of continental African in GWAS is still very low, both in the number of studies and the total number of study participants
 For example, Type 2 diabetes GWAS studies with over a million Europeans participants are being reported while the sample sizes of continental Africans remain under 10,000 (7; )
 Therefore, continental Africans face a much worse threat than African Americans of under-representation in precision medicine efforts for type 2 diabetes()
 It has been reported that multi-ethnic PRS (compared to European only PRS) might enhance prediction in diverse populations(12; )
 However, the predictive ability of the multi-ethnic derived PRS and that of African Americans (who have ~80% African admixture) is yet to be evaluated in continental Africans (12; )
 We set up this study to evaluate the predictivity of European, African American and multi-ethnic derived polygenic risk scores  for type 2 diabetes in continental Africans
  Participants were from the Durban Case Control (DCC) study (1602 cases) and 976 controls from the Durban Diabetes Study (DDS) and collectively there are regarded as the South African Zulu study ()

 The 1031 cases and 738 controls from this study were enrolled at university medical centers in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya()
 In this study, diabetes was defined based on oral glucose tolerance test, fasting glucose or exhibiting symptoms of diabetes(17) 
 Written informed consent was completed by the study participants

 Detailed quality control and imputation for these studies has been described elsewhere(11; )
 A minimum MAF threshold of

 Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the predictive capacity of the PRS as shown in Figure 1A and C

 Our study set out to assess the predictive value of type 2 diabetes PRS in continental Africans
 In this study, we set out to compare the polygenic prediction of African American, European and multi-ethnic PRSs for type 2 diabetes in continental Africans
 The PRS with the best prediction was derived from an African American restricted GWAS()
 Participants in the 10th decile of this PRS had a more than 3-fold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and were diagnosed

 ;    Limited studies of candidate SNP PRS have been performed in continental Africans
 Previously we reported a genetic risk score with weights from Europeans that was associated with OR = 
21, 95%CI (
 
43) for type 2 diabetes in black South Africans()
 This GRS had an AUC of 
665 together with conventional risk factors for type 2 diabetes ()
 However, this study was limited due to the small sample size (n = 356), the availability of only genotyped SNPs, and the use of weights that were derived from European-only studies
 In our current study we have substantially expanded the sample size (n = 1,690), enhanced genome coverage by imputing to 1000 Genomes and local African Ancestry whole genomes(18), and used a multi-ethnic discovery dataset GWAS that included 
4 million individuals which included people of African American ancestry
 All these factors helped to Nonetheless, polygenic predictions of European derived PRS in Europeans are still higher compared to that of the African Americans in continental Africans()
 Notably, participants in the top decile of a European derived PRS have recently been reported to have a greater than 5-fold risk for developing type 2 diabetes compared to those in the first decile in Europeans()
  Failure to reach predictions denoted in Europeans might be due to that in our study, the African American derived PRS are from an admixed population group that is not representative of the genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium patterns of continental Africans(13; )
 In addition, vast improvements in sizes of the European cohorts that are now over a million individuals, is indicative of substantial power compared to African diabetes cohorts that are still below the 10 thousand mark ()
 More investments are thus required to increase the representation of continental Africans in GWAS of type 2 diabetes

 ;    The utility of polygenic risk scores is an issue of paramount importance for clinical translation()
 The African American PRS, though it was predictive for type 2 diabetes in continental Africans, only improved the AUC of conventional risk factors by 
6% and  when combined with PCs its AUC was 
6% while that of the conventional risk factors was 
 %
 Similarly, in a Swedish type 2 diabetes study, the European derived PRS increased the AUC by 1% compared to conventional risk factors ()
 Basing on the AUC, the prediction of type 2 diabetes in our study by conventional risk factors (age, sex and BMI) was more clinically useful, as it was greater than the accepted threshold of %()
 However, the use of AUC as a measure to evaluate clinical utility of polygenic prediction is being debated, as it is regarded as less sensitive metric()
 There are ongoing efforts to develop better metrics (24), nonetheless, findings from this study that  people with type 2 diabetes and a high PRS are typically diagnosed at an earlier age and have a 3 fold risk of developing diabetes are of clinical importance
 They may be useful in prevention and treatment of Our study was limited by the limited number of GWAS of type 2 diabetes of continental Africans
 Nonetheless, the African American derived PRS improved disease classification in this population
 The clumping and thresholding approach used to compute the genome-wide PRS did not account for environmental factors such as diet, exercise that might confound the predictive accuracy of these measures
 The strengths of our study include validation of the African American PRS in the AADM study and the fact that we used GWAS summary statistics of varied ethnicities from the same study which minimized bias due to genotyping (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    In summary, an African American derived PRS seems to be the best predictor for type 2 diabetes in continental Africans, as compared to a European and multiethnic PRS
 More studies are required to determine whether using continental African GWAS might further enhance these predictions and reach a similar accuracy as in Europeans
