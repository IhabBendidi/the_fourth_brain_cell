 geroprotectors
 Plants including Aronia used as dietary supplements are an excellent source of these compounds
 We have studied the effects of the ethanol extract from Aronia fruits on shock and starvation)
 And also, in order to reveal the influence of Aronia extract applied to different life cycles of Drosophila melanogaster, we selected different dietary schemes for imago: throughout life, during the first two weeks (1  2) and during average age (4  6 weeks)
 It was revealed that the ethanol extract of chokeberry increases the median life expectancy in males and females by 5% when Drosophila melanogaster is added to the diet for 4  6 weeks of life
 This suggests that intervention even in old age is sufficient to increase lifespan
 In addition, no harmful effects of ABE on locomotor activity were found as an indicator of fly health
 We showed that Aronia extract increased stress resistance to hyperthermia and oxidative stress
 At the same time, Aronia extract did not significantly affect the resistance of flies to starvation
 ABE supplementation has increased expression of heat shock proteins (Hsp27, Hsp68, Hsp83), oxidative stress resistance genes (Keap1, NRF, Sod1), some circadian clock genes (Clk, per) and gene of longevity Sirt

 ;    Aging can be defined as a process that leads to a progressive decline in physiological integrity and organ dysfunctions (Van Beek et al )
 This decline is spreading at all levels of biological organization: molecular, cellular, tissue, and organismic (He and Jasper 2014a; Martel et al 2019; Wang et al a)
  Hormesis is the stimulation of protective cellular mechanisms when exposed to mild stress (Rattan 2008) aiming in maintaining homeostasis that provides long-term positive effects (Calabrese et al 2015; Rattan 1996; Rattan )
 Hormesis inducers, so-called hormetins, can activate heat shock proteins and proteasomal degradation of damaged proteins (Beedholm et al 2004; Verbeke et al 2001a; Verbeke et al 2001b)  DNA repair (Martel et al 2019)  autophagy (Markaki and Tavernarakis 2011; Ryter and Choi 2013), an antioxidant defense that can promote lifespan increase (Pietsch et al 2011; Rattan )
 Hormetins may be food components, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, vitamins, trace elements which have a positive effect on the age-related quality of life (Calabrese and Blain 2005; Proshkina et al 2020; Rattan )
  Aronia melanocarpa ((Michx
) Elliot) relates to the family Rosaceae
 In height, the Aronia bush can reach up to 1  2 meters, its distinctive feature is dark red, almost black fruits in the form of an apple (Cvetanovi et al 2018; Hudec et al 2006; Jurikova et al 2017; Kokotkiewicz et al 2010) In addition, black chokeberry is known all over the world due to its high content of various polyphenols, phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, as well as vitamins and macro  and microelements (Borowska and Brzska 2016; Cvetanovi et al 2018; Hudec et al 2006; Jurikova et al 2017; Kokotkiewicz et al 2010; Oszmiaski and Wojdylo 2005; Paulrayer et al 2017; Staszowska-Karkut and Materska 2020; Taheri et al )
 In past centuries, both in North America and in Russia, natural products (berries, fruits, leaves, stems) were used in traditional medicine (Cvetanovi et al 2018; Jurikova et al 2017; Kokotkiewicz et al )
 It was noted that the anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of the use of decoctions, juices and infusions of chokeberry, which have a positive effect on the health and longevity of the organism (Jurikova et al 2017; Kokotkiewicz et al 2010; Staszowska-Karkut and Materska )
 This means that society is interested in improving the quality of life and health with age, therefore, the current generation relies on the experience of the past, with the use of modern technologies

 ;    The aging process is known to be associated with multiple changes in the body, including slow down of all biological processes, decrease of the reproductive activity and increase of inflammation (Flatt 2020; Rattan )
 Recently, acetone extract of chokeberry fruits has shown to increase the median lifespan and locomotor activity in Drosophila (Jo and Imm 2017) The lifespan extending effect was associated with increased expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) genes and suppression of the methuselah (MTH) gene (Jo and Imm )
 It was shown that lifelong use of the polyphenol-rich extracts from blueberry (Peng et al 2012), cloudberry (Lashmanova et al 2019), rotten apple (Peng et al 2011), cranberry (Wang et al 2015) have positive effects on the Drosophila melanogaster lifespan
 But the use of a geroprotector throughout life may be accompanied with increased risk of harmful side effects (Moskalev et al 2016) and it is also known that the geroprotective effect persists when treated at a certain age
 Therefore, in addition to experiments with the use of any substances throughout the life of model organisms, experiments were carried out where the effect of a substance on life expectancy was carried out only at an old age, in order to identify the greatest geroprotective potential of the studied substances
 It was found that in adult mice (aged 20  22 months), when added to food, rapamycin exhibited the greatest geroprotective effect than in young mice (Wilkinson et al )
  The beneficial effects of chokeberry extracts have been revealed in different in vitro and in vivo models and at different levels from the cellular (Abdullah Thani et al 2012; Cvetanovi et al 2018; Parzonko et al 2015; Valdez et al 2020) before organismic The purpose of this work was to reveal the lifespan effects induced by ABE treatment at different ages
 To assess whether the geroprotective effects of ABE can be affected by the age of treatment we supplemented Aronia extract to the Drosophila imago throughout life, during the ages of 1-2 weeks and 4-6 weeks of life, that correspond to young and average ages, respectively
 We studied the effects of ABE treatment at different ages and resistance
  The maximum beneficial effect on lifespan was found for ABE treatment at the age of 4  6 weeks (3  %)
 The performed RT-PCR assay revealed the effects of ABE on the age-related changes in the expression level of stress response genes
 The ABE supplementation has increased expression of heat shock proteins (Hsp27, Hsp68, Hsp83), oxidative stress resistance genes (Keap1, NRF, Sod1), circadian clock genes (Clk, per) and gene of longevity Sirt1 thereby increases resistance to oxidative stress and hyperthermia, but (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Therefore, ABE shows that different dietary schemes extended lifespan and resistance to different stress
 Aronia berries were harvested in the autumn period (August - September), on the territory of the Komi Republic (Northwest Russia)
 The berries were pre-frozen at a temperature of - 20  C
 To prepare the extract, the fruits were crushed and centrifuged to obtain a supernatant
 This mass was mixed with clay (
1 molar hydrochloric acid solution) and centrifuged again
 The resulting liquid was poured off and mixed with the extractant: 1% solution of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 96% ethanol
 The resulting solution was centrifuged, and then ethanol from the extract was evaporated on an IR-1M vacuum rotary evaporator (Khimlaborpribor, Russia) at 35  C
 The experimental concentrations of Aronia berry extract (ABE) were prepared from the obtained ethanol extract by dilution in 96% ethanol
 ABE samples were analyzed on a Thermo Finnigan liquid chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc
, USA) using a diode array detector (200  600 nm) in tandem with a mass selective detector of the same company
 The analysis was carried out at a wavelength of 520 nm, an eluent feed rate of 1 ml/min, analysis time of 40 minutes, in isocratic mode
 The eluent acetonitrile - an aqueous solution of formic acid (10%) in the ratio of 7:93 (v/v) was used in the analysis)
 Column 4  250 mm with a sorbent Diasorb-130-C16T, granulation 7 For sample preparation 1 mg of the extract was dissolved in 10 ml of deionized water, after which it was applied to a prepared cartridge with the Hypersep C18 sorbent
 The cartridge with the applied extract was washed with 10 ml of deionized water, then the target substances were washed off the cartridge with 1 ml of eluent (acetonitrile  aqueous formic acid solution (10%) in the ratio of 7:93 (v/v)

0 was used to analyze the signal data from FLIC To determine the active substances in the ethanol extract of chokeberry, an HPLC method was required, which was carried out at a wavelength of 520 nm, an eluent flow rate of 1 ml/min and an analysis time of 40 minutes in an isocratic mode (Fig )
 The chromatogram (Fig 1) shows the main jumps: at 
54 min - delphinidin (Glu), 
38 min - delphinidin (Rut), 
64 min - cyanidin (Glu), which indicates that these substances are the main ones in the analyzed extract
 Delphinidin and cyanidin are anthocyanidins, they are found in many bright blue-red fruits and berries, such as Manitoba berries, Saskatoon berry (Hosseinian and Beta 2007), eggplant (Sigurdson et al 2018) , more delphinidin will be collected
 Cyanidin is the most common in raspberries, strawberries (Hosseinian and Beta 2007), and black chokeberry (Jurikova et al 2017), sour cherry (Ertan et al 2018) in apple skin (Ban et al 2009),  acai (Yamaguchi et al )
 Unlike other fruits and berries, aronia fruits can contain a wide range of biologically active proanthocyanidins in various proportions (Toli et al )
 This largely depends on the time of collection, on soil factors, climatic conditions, as well as on the extraction method (water, acetone, ethanol, water-ethanol) (Cvetanovi et al 2018; Hudec et al 2006; Jurikova et al (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    The effects of treatment with Aronia berry extract (ABE) at different ages of the imago The aging is associated with multiple physiological disorders
 While reproductive potential increase (Flatt 2020; He and Jasper b)
 Thereby the effect of geroprotective intervention may depend on the age of the organism
 To reveal the connection between the geroprotective effect and age we studied the lifespan effects of ABE when imago flies were treated at different ages
 In addition, it is necessary to take into account the characteristics of the periodization of the fly's life cycle, during which the most important changes in the body occur: reproductive maturation (the first days of life), then reproductive activity, then a decrease in reproductive activity and further death (Flatt )
 Therefore, we chose different treatment ages, namely: (1) throughout life, (2) at the age of 1  2 and (3) 4  6 weeks at different concentrations (
01; 0, 1; 
0; 
5; 
0 and 10 mg/ml)
 It was revealed that the ethanol extract from the fruits of chokeberry in concentrations: 
01; 
1; 
0; 
5; 
0 and 
0 mg/ml, supplied with food throughout life, negatively affects the median and the maximum lifespan (LS) of male (see Fig
 2A, B) and female (see Fig
 3A, B) Drosophila melanogaster (Supplementary Table S)
 When the extract was added to food for 1  2 weeks of adult life, 
5 mg/ml in males (Fig
 2C, D) slightly increased the median lifespan (by 3%), and in females (Fig
 3C, D) 
0 mg/ml reduced the median LS of fruit flies by 9% (Supplementary Table S)
 Adding the extract to food at 4-6 weeks of adult life in males (Fig
 2E, F) increased the median lifespan by 5%, and the maximum LS was increased by 9% at concentrations of 
1 and 
0 mg/ml
 In females (Fig
 3E, F), 
1 and 
0 mg/ml prolonged the median lifespan by 5%, and all concentrations except 
0 mg/ml increased the maximum lifespan of fruit flies by 3% (Supplementary Table S)
 Based on the data obtained, the use of the extract in middle age (4  6 weeks of life) has the greatest effect in increasing the lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster than its use throughout life and in the first Previously, the effect of berry extracts used throughout the life of an imago on the model organism of Drosophila melanogaster was studied
 Powder extract from bilberry (
0 and 
0 mg/ml) increased the average lifespan by 10% in Drosophila melanogaster (Peng et al 2012)  Acetone extract of cloudberries (
12 mg/ml) in females caused an increase in median lifespan by 11% (Lashmanova et al )
 Polyphenol-rich apples increased average lifespan by 10% (Peng et al )
 Anthocyanin extract of cranberry (20 mg/ml) also increased the average lifespan of males by 10% (Wang et al )

 ;    of rapamycin with food
 In the group of mice receiving rapamycin, it showed a geroprotective effect, namely, reduced the risk of developing age-related diseases (changes in the liver, heart, adrenal glands) compared with the control group (Wilkinson et al 2012) In our experiments, we confirmed that to increase the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster, a short intervention is enough even in old age
 And when the extract is used throughout life, it has a negative effect, perhaps this is due to the extraction method and its contents
 Aging is associated with a decrease in the functionality of the whole organism and in particular the locomotor function (Wang et al b)
 Therefore, to reveal the potential efficiency of chokeberry extract to delay the functional aging of flies, we investigated the effect of the most effective geroprotective concentrations (
1; 
0 and 5 mg/ml) on the age-No statistically significant differences in locomotor activity under the influence of chokeberry extract were revealed in males (Fig
 A)
 However, in females (see Fig
 4B) 5 mg/ml ABE was the most effective concentration, which increased their locomotor activity at the age of 4 weeks old
 At the same time, no harmful effects of ABE on locomotor activity as One of the previous studies showed that Aronia supplement at a concentration of 
5 mg/ml also useful for maintaining locomotor activity in male flies (Jo and Imm )
 This suggests that Aronia supplement may increase not only lifespan, but healthspan also
 However, in several other works, berry supplements had no effect on locomotor activity in rats (Eftimov and Valcheva-Kuzmanova 2018; Fernndez-Demeneghi et al 2019; Janakova et al 2016; (Pomatto et al )
 So the question has been raised, what exactly is the mechanism of influence on locomotor activity by berries? The posed question needs to be verified by other Under the influence of external (changes in diet and lifestyle) and internal (various diseases) factors, the permeability of the intestinal barrier decreases (an increase in the number of inflammatory reactions and a decrease in the protective function) which negatively affects the health and quality of life of the body, especially with age

 ;    of the intestinal barrier, namely its permeability, it is possible to reduce the number of age-dependent diseases and increase lifespan (Bischoff et al 2014; Rera et al 2012; Vancamelbeke and Vermeire )
 We have studied the effect of ABE on the Drosophila intestinal barrier permeability at the age of 2, 6 and 8 weeks old (Supplementary Table S)
  At the age of 2 weeks, flies with the Smurf phenotype were not found
 But at the age of 6 weeks flies and 8 weeks with the Smurf phenotype were identified
 This suggests that with age, the functioning of a living organization decreases, including a violation of the integrity of the intestine, which in the future can lead to the death of the organism (Rera et al )
 But, no significant changes in males and females were found at 2, 6 and 8 weeks of life, which suggests that the ethanol extract of chokeberry with concentrations of 
01; 
1; 
0; 
5; 
0 and 
0 mg/ml had no negative effect on the permeability of the intestinal barrier
  Previously the effect of various chokeberry extracts on gastric permeability has been studied
 Valdez et al, shows that aronia polyphenolic powder improved (
510 mg/ml) barrier function of inflamed Caco-2 cells (Valdez et al )
 Olejnik et al, in vitro experiments on Caco-2 cells, using the Sambucus nigra L
 fruit extract passing through the gastric tract, had an anti-inflammatory effect (Olejnik et al )
 Paulrayer et al found a gastroprotective effect in rats at a concentration of 200 mg/kg of an aqueous alcoholic extract of chokeberry (Paulrayer et al )
 From the above studies, it can be assumed that chokeberry extracts have a protective effect on the gastrointestinal tract, which is directly related to the quality of syndrome, insulin resistance) (Rera et al )
 Further study is needed of the effects of chokeberry extract, with a possible decrease in concentration, on the permeability of the The high levels of phenolic compounds in Aronia may contribute to pronounced bitterness, sourness and astringency of ABE containing food media (Duffy et al 2016; Sidor and Gramza-Michaowska 2019) and influence the feeding rate (Ro et al )
 Both reduced or excessive food consumption may affect nutritional status, health, and finally the lifespan (Tatar et al 2014; Wong et al )
 To find out how ABE supplementation affects the food consumption we studied dietary preferences of flies at different ages using the FLIC system (Ro et al )
 In addition we revealed the possible effect of habituation to chokeberry (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    flavor by analyzing feeding behaviour in flies that were kept either on control media or on The obtained results reflect the lack of strong preference (mean PI varies in wide ranges) of the males (
01 mg/ml ABE) and females (
01, 
5, and 10 mg/ml ABE) for ABE or +ABE food medium (Fig
 )
 This data confirms the results of a previous study that demonstrated no significant difference in food intake between flies from control and supplemented with 
5 mg/ml aronia acetone extract groups estimated by gustatory assay (Jo and Imm 2017) demonstrating that the observed effects on lifespan and on healthspan are not associated with changes in food consumption
 At the same time males of all groups exhibited weak preference (mean PI~
2) in favor of control (-ABE) medium over 10 mg/ml ABE (Fig
 5E), suggesting that at high concentrations, the intense taste of chokeberry extract can lead to reduced food intake and induce dietary restriction-mediated effects
 Control and ABE pretreated 7 days old males exhibited statistically significant (p<
05) weak preference (mean PI~
3) in favor of 
5 mg/ml ABE media compared to 45 days old males (Fig
 C)
 These age-related changes in food preference may partly explain the differences in lifespan effects The mechanisms of resistance to stress and longevity are interrelated (Saunders and Verdin )
 Oxidative stress, which leads to disruption of redox homeostasis, is one of the important factors of aging and the organism's ability to respond to oxidative stress plays an important role in longevity (Kuether and Arking )
 Treatment of flies with paraquat, high temperature and starvation may be a cause of free radicals, which in the future can lead to pathological processes in the body and further death (Nordquist et al 1995; Robinson et al 1997; Turrens )
 In addition decreased stress tolerance is one of the manifestations of aging (Ikeyama et al 2002; Pandolf )
 Therefore, we were interested in how the aronia extract will affect the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster to various stresses (oxidative, hyperthermia and starvation) at the age of 14 and 33 days old (see Fig
 )
 In these assays we used the extract at concentrations of 
1; 
0 and 
0 mg/ml, that demonstrated the most According to our data, in males (Fig
 6A), 
0 mg/ml ABE increased resistance to oxidative stress at 33 days of life but significantly reduced resistance to starvation at 14 days (Fig
 C)
 And 
1 and

 6E) on the 14th day of imago life
 In females, 5 mg/ml ABE had a protective effect against oxidative stress at 33 days of age (Fig
 6B), as well as starvation at 14 days of age in flies (Fig
 D)
 On the 14th day of females' life, 
1 and 
0 mg/ml ABE increased resistance to hyperthermia, but on the 33rd day, all concentrations had a negative effect on resistance to hyperthermia (Fig
 F)
 It is well known, Keap1 suppresses transcription activity of Nrf2 (Jaramillo and Zhang )
 Keap1/NRF2 signaling protects the body from oxidative stress, including aging-related diseases (Cheng et al 2016; Li et al 2019; Martel et al 2019; Sykiotis and Bohmann )
 We have shown an increase the resistance to oxidative stress of Drosophila at 14 and 33 days after treatment with ABE, perhaps it is due to the activation of Nrf2 and the subsequent decrease in the level of expression of Keap
 At the same time, Aronia extract did not significantly affect the resistance of flies to starvation, a similar effect Findings on the effect of ABE on the resistance to hyperthermia, it can be concluded that when Aronia extract is obtained for 14 days, both males and females, stress resistance increases, but already on day 33 their stress resistance decreases in both males and females
 Perhaps due to prolonged and/or intake of high doses, flavonoids begin to act as mutagens, prooxidants, thereby aggravating their quality of life (Skibola and Smith )
 Changes in gene expression levels are associated with the health and lifespan (Tyshkovskiy et al )
 Plant extracts have a wide range of pharmacological effects, which at the molecular level are determined by the effects on the transcriptional activity of genes, including stress response genes
 Thus, we have studied the changes in expression level of cellular stress response genes, including heat shock proteins (Hsp27, Hsp68, Hsp83), oxidative stress resistance genes (Keap1, NRF, Sod1, HIF1) and circadian clock genes (Clk, per) gene of longevity Sirt
 The mRNA expression level was identified by RT-PCR on 14 (Supplementary Table S6) and 33 (Supplementary Table S7) days of the life
 The effects of 
1; 
0 and 
0 mg/ml of chokeberry extract were analyzed (see Fig
 )
 It was revealed that in males at the age of 33 days old (Fig
 7C) 
1 mg/ml of ABE increased the expression of Clk gene, while the transcriptional activity of per gene decreased
 At the same time, females exhibited increased expression of per at concentrations of 
1 and 
0 mg/ml
 And also on the 33rd day of life, there was a slight increase in Clk expression level at all ABE concentrations used
 At the age of 14 days old, males (Fig

 ;    increase in the expression of oxidative stress resistance genes such as Keap1 (
1 mg/ml) and sirt1 (
0 mg/ml) and the expression of these genes decreased with age
 In females of different ages, the changes in the expression level of the most studied genes were not significant, except for Keap1, which demonstrated the increase of the expression level after supplementation with 
1 mg/ml of ABE on day 
 With age (33 days of life) (see Fig
 7C), an increase in the expression level of Hsp68 was caused by 
 
 In females, on the 14th day of life (Fig
 7B), an increase in the expression level of the Hsp83 gene was observed at 
1 mg/ml of ABE, at the same time, on the 33rd day of life (Fig
 7D), there was more pronounced increase in the expression level of Hsp27 at 
1 mg/ml than other concentrations
 With age, females show a general increase in the expression level of genes encoding heat We demonstrated that the Aronia extract increased expression of the sirt1 gene that previously showed to be involved in cellular stress defense mechanisms such as protection against oxidative stress, DNA repair and may contribute to decrease in risk of various age-related disorders (Elibol and Kilic 2018; Kayashima et al )
 The heat shock proteins (HSP) is one of the systems of cellular defense in response to various stress conditions
 Increased expression of HSP genes such as Hsp27, Hsp68 and Hsp83 may increase resistance to paraquat and starvation (Wang et al b)
 It has been shown that Hsps are involved in acquired resistance to stress (hormesis), such hormesis correlates with increased Hsp expression and may lead to a slight increase in lifespan (Tower )
 Our data on increased expression of heat shock proteins genes also show a connection with these statements
 It should be noted that the effects of HSPs overexpression on longevity are ambiguous
 For example overexpression of hsp70 in the nervous system and muscles or RNAi-mediated down-regulation of hsp70 had shown no effect on Drosophila longevity while ubiquitous The treatment of cells with anthocyanin-rich extract of Aronia melanocarpa shown to increase the level of Nrf2 in a concentration-dependent manner
 The extract increased activation of Nrf2 approximately 
5 times in a concentration of 25 g/ml in comparison with angiotensin II treated cells (Parzonko et al )
 Treatment of a glioblastoma cell line (U373) with an extract of chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) and curcumin (Curcuma longa), for 48 hours, caused a decrease in the expression of the MMP-2, -14, -16 and -17 genes(Abdullah Thani et al )

 The the positive effect on lifespan has been reported to be associated with increased expression of SOD, CAT, GPx genes and suppression of the MTH gene (Jo and Imm 2017; Lashmanova et al 2019; Peng et al 2011; Peng et al 2012; Wang et al )
 Antioxidant activity (decrease in the level of Sod2, Gpx1 and Prdx1) of 
5% lyophilized powder of chokeberry berries was also revealed in the colon and mesenteric lymph node (Pei et al 2019a; Pei et al b)
 Ethanol extract of chokeberry has been shown to inhibit hydrogen peroxide-induced ROS production in murine macrophage cell culture in a dose-dependent manner and exhibit strong radical scavenging activity (Ghosh et al 2018) In this study, we found that the extract of chokeberry in small concentrations and for a limited period of time (in our case, two weeks), increases lifespan, which means it corresponds to the idea that chokeberry may be hormetin
 In addition, it was found that the black chokeberry extract meets the main criteria of a geroprotector: it is not toxic and does not exhibit toxic properties, it increases the lifespan of the model organism and improves the quality of life
 ABE also meets the secondary criteria: it increases resistance to environmental stressors and has prophylactic properties against age-related diseases (Moskalev et al )
 The interest of society in improving the quality of life and possible longevity is growing every year, and this is possible due to the reduction of age-related diseases (inflammatory processes in the organism) (Jurikova et al 2017; Kokotkiewicz et al 2010; Staszowska-Karkut and Materska )
 Based on the traditional medicine, we can assume that by supplementing our diet with natural products (berries, fruits and vegetables), we can significantly improve the health of our organism with age (Belwal et al 2017; Kokotkiewicz et al 2010; Kristo et al 2016; Prior 2010) Besides, with age dietary needs change, especially which nutrients are important and needed for an aging organism (Institute of Medicine Food )
 As mentioned earlier, a plant-based diet containing substances such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanins may have positive effects on lifespan and also can help with anti-aging diseases
 However, the amount and timing of nutrient intake are equally important
 The optimal effect of diet on aging and disease is usually associated with a narrow dose range
 Excessive intake or deficiency of nutrients can have an adverse effect on the organism's health because the dose  response relationship is non-linear (Evangelakou et al 2019; Skorupa et al )
 With regard to the period of nutrient intake, in old age the use of (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    many nutrients becomes less efficient, therefore, their demand increases
 It becomes necessary to add berries, fruits and vegetables to the diet, which contain large amounts of polyphenols, including anthocyanins
 Anthocyanins produce a wide range of health benefits such as weight gain, anti-inflammatory, insulin resistance and regulation of immune function (Belwal et al 2017; Ding et al 2018; Prior 2010; Valenza et al )
 It is suggested that berries and fruits supplement to the diet may not only help reduce the risk of various diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular, type 2 diabetes, but also improve the quality and longevity of life
 (Basu et al 2010; Calvano et al 2019; Kalt et al 2020; Kristo et al )
 Perhaps the anthocyanins that contained in Aronia may act as mild stress and activate protective  The obtained data suggest that the most pronounced geroprotective effect of ABE observed when treatment was conducted at the age of 4-6 weeks relative to the other tested regimes (Institute of Medicine Food )
 Namely, when ABE is used in middle age (4-6 weeks of life) and for a limited period of time (in our case, 2 weeks), the average life expectancy in males and females increases by 5% (
1 and 
0 mg/ml)
 The maximum lifespan of ABE (
01; 
1; 
5 and 
0 mg/ml) increases by 3% in females, and in males by 9% (
1 and 
0 mg/ml) Drosophila melanogaster
 Other results are observed in females, perhaps this is due to sexual dimorphism
 The study showed that genes are expressed differently depending on gender (Parisi et al )
 This is probably because females need more nutrients, due to sexual dimorphism, that is females experience constant energy costs for reproduction through continuous laying eggs (Camus et al 2017; Wu et al )
 
1 mg/ml increases resistance to oxidative stress on the 33rd day of life of flies
 In addition, 
0 mg/ml is an effective dose for females with regard to locomotor activity, as well as to increase resistance to oxidative stress at 33 days of life, as well as hyperthermia and starvation at 14 days of age
 Hormetic reactions associated with the Nrf2 / Keap pathway exhibit the geroprotective effect of ethanol extract of chokeberry berries
 The same metabolic pathways and cellular processes are activated by polyphenols (Martel et al )
 Anthocyanins found in chokeberry fruits, may reduce ROS levels by activating NRF2 thereby inducing the expression of antioxidant enzymes (Belwal et al 2017; Ding et al 2018; Prior 2010; Valenza et al )
 The induced increase in the lifespan of Drosophila Aronia extract could be due to hormetic reactions

 ;    According to our data, the ethanol extract of chokeberry in low concentrations and in a short time period manifests itself as hormetin, thereby showing the greatest geroprotective potential, on the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster
 In addition, it can be assumed that we have found the critical age for dietary intervention, when the addition of Aronia extract maximizes the median and maximum life expectancy
 However, for such high-profile statements, more experiments are needed with different extracts and their reproducible But, our result shows that black chokeberry extract contains various antioxidants that may positively affect the longevity of life
 In addition, Aronia extract may increase the resistance of flies to hyperthermia and oxidative stress
