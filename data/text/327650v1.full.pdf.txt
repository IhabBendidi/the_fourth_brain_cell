 ;    Amblyopia is a common visual disorder that is treatable in childhood
 However, therapies have limited 2 efficacy in adult patients with amblyopia
 Fluoxetine can reinstate early-life critical period-like neuronal 3 plasticity and has been used to recover functional vision in adult rats with amblyopia
 This phase 2, 4 randomized, double-blind (fluoxetine vs
 placebo), multicenter clinical trial examined whether or not 5 fluoxetine can improve visual acuity in amblyopic adults
 This interventional trial included 42 participants 6 diagnosed with moderate to severe amblyopia
 Subjects were randomized to receive either 20 mg 7 fluoxetine (n=22) or placebo (n=)
 During the 10-week treatment period, all subjects performed daily 8 computerized perceptual training and eye patching
 There was no significant difference in treatment 9 efficacy between the groups
 Visual acuity at the primary endpoint had significantly improved over 10 baseline in both the fluoxetine (-
167 logMAR) and placebo (-
194 logMAR) groups (both p < 
 )
 11 Because patching alone is not effective in adults, the visual acuity improvement likely resulted from 12 perceptual training
 There was a positive correlation between visual acuity improvement and the 13 perceptual training time
 While this study failed to provide evidence that fluoxetine enhances 14 neuroplasticity, our data support the usefulness of perceptual training for vision improvement in adults 15 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;     Amblyopia is a condition in which the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is impaired in one eye or, 2 less frequently, both eyes, even though no ocular abnormalities are generally present
 Amblyopia develops 3 when one or both eyes have abnormal visual input (either physical or physiological) during the sensitive 4 period in childhood (from birth to 6 years)
1, 2 Amblyopia is most commonly caused by strabismus in very 5 young children (<3 years of age, 82%)3 and by refractive errors (anisometropia, isoametropia) in older 6 children
 4, 5 In the clinical setting, moderate amblyopia is defined as a logarithm of the minimum angle of 7 resolution (logMAR) BCVA of 
30 (Snellen equivalent: 20/40) and/or an interocular BCVA difference 8 of 
2 logMAR or more (in cases of unilateral amblyopia)
 The prevalence of amblyopia in the general 9 population varies from 
3% to 
6%, and it is one of the most common causes of monocular visual 10 impairment in adults
4, 6, 7 Patients with monocular amblyopia have a significantly increased risk of visual 11 impairment if vision in their good eye is lost as a result of trauma or disease
8, 9  12  Amblyopia can be treated in early life, 1012 but visual gains diminish in school-aged children because 13 of a decline in visual system neuroplasticity and, possibly, treatment compliance
1, 1315 Amblyopia is very 14 difficult, if not impossible, to treat in adults
16   15  An improved understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying amblyopia and adult brain 16 neuroplasticity1719 has led to the development of visual rehabilitation methods that can be used after the 17 critical period
2024 Experimental models of amblyopia are based on the effects of monocular deprivation 18 on the structure and function of the visual cortex
25, 26 Using an animal model, Espinosa and Stryker26 19 showed that the effects of amblyopia can be reversed during the critical period in early postnatal 20 development, but not later in life
 However, recent evidence indicates that environmental enrichment27, 28 21 and pharmacological treatment29 can reactivate critical period-like plasticity in the visual cortex of adult 22 rodents
 In particular, fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), promotes neuroplasticity 23 and neurogenesis30 and reactivates critical period-like plasticity in the rat visual cortex
18 24  An emerging body of literature suggests that vision improvements can be achieved with 25 conventional therapies (e
 g
, occlusion therapy) in adolescents (i
 e
, older children and teenagers)3133 and 26 adults20, 21, 34, 35 with amblyopia even though post-childhood amblyopia is generally considered untreatable

6%) required new spectacles before 12 randomization
 Four subjects were non-compliant, 3 subjects withdrew their consent, and 1 subject was 13 lost to follow-up
 Therefore, a total of 37 subjects ultimately completed the 10-week treatment period, 14 including primary endpoint assessments, and 34 completed the 3-month post-treatment follow-up period 15 (20  in the fluoxetine group and 14 in the control group; Figure )
 Data from all 42 randomized subjects 16 were subjected to an intention-to-treat analysis and were included in analyses
 Subjects that completed the 17 study showed good medication compliance (>85%) and completed >85% of the computerized perceptual 18  Baseline demographic and ocular parameters are summarized in Table 
 Briefly, best-corrected 20 logMAR visual acuity at baseline was between

 Four subjects (1 in the control group and 3 in the 23 fluoxetine group) exhibited combined strabismic-anisometropic amblyopia, while 1 subject in fluoxetine 24 group exhibited strabismic amblyopia

 The visual acuity improvements observed in 5 both groups were maintained 10 to 22 weeks after discontinuing all treatments (medication, eye patching, 6 and perceptual training)
 In addition, visual gains of at least 
2 logMAR units persisted in many subjects 7 in both groups [9 of 20 fluoxetine subjects (

 Binocularity, contrast 13 sensitivity and crowded near visual acuity improved in both the control and fluoxetine groups
 Binocular 14 vision was assessed for both near (33 cm) and distant (4 m) vision
 Twenty-two subjects (9 control group 15 subjects, 13 fluoxetine group subjects) had suppression or ARC in the 4-m test at baseline (Figure A)

  6  The proportion of patients with an improvement in at least one of the visual function parameters was 7 60% in both treatment groups after 10 weeks of treatment
 Three months after treatment completion (22 8 weeks), this proportion had increased to 70% in the fluoxetine group and 64% in the control group
 9 Moreover, 73% of the fluoxetine group subjects and 70% of the control group subjects showed a clinically 10 relevant improvement in at least one visual function parameter at some point during the study
 11 Improvements in visual function parameters are summarized in Table 
 12  Our clinical study protocol also included prespecified subgroup analyses, which assessed the effect of 13 the severity of amblyopia (moderate/severe), binocularity (suppression/normal fusion), sex (female/male), 14 compliance with software-based training (85%/<85%), and age (<40/40 years) on changes in visual 15 acuity (logMAR)

 One serious adverse event (benign 3 ovarian cyst of moderate severity) occurred during the study, but it was not related to study treatment
 4  Amblyopia is a complex brain disorder that can restrict everyday life because of the visual limitations 7 it imposes
 Despite good screening programs and effective childhood treatments, amblyopia remains a 8 common cause of lifelong visual impairment independent of location or ethnic origin
4, 7, 9, 41 The 9 combination of adequate refractive correction and occlusion therapy (patching of non-amblyopic eye) has 10 been the mainstay therapy for amblyopia of all etiologies
 However, the benefits of various forms of 11 occlusion therapy are greatest when therapy is started at an early age (<8 years)
 Therefore, early 12 amblyopia detection and treatment is the most important factor for obtaining successful visual outcomes
 13 Physiologically, the brain has the greatest plasticity during the critical period in early postnatal life
 14 However, recent evidence strongly indicates that the primary sensory cortex may remain plastic into 15 adulthood
1724, 2730 This finding suggests that there is a physiological basis for treating amblyopia in 16 adulthood, which provides an opportunity to potentially alleviate this world-wide public health problem
  17  The current study examined whether fluoxetine, an SSRI known to modulate adult rat visual cortex 18 plasticity18, can enhance the effects of patching/computer-based perceptual training combination therapy 19 in adults with amblyopia
 The treatment response was good in both the fluoxetine and placebo study 20 groups, with an overall visual rehabilitation success rate of %
 In addition, 17% of patients achieved 21 normal visual acuity in the amblyopic eye (Table )
 Our results are in agreement with those of Li et al40, 22 who found that 33% of adult amblyopic subjects had a substantial improvement in visual acuity following 23 video game-based perceptual training
 In addition, our subjects had an average gain of approximately 2 24 lines of vision (
2 logMAR), which was similar to improvements observed with other published training 25 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;     The change in visual acuity after 10 weeks of study medication/perceptual training therapy was not 1 significantly different between subjects taking fluoxetine and subjects taking a matching placebo
 It may 2 be that 20 mg of fluoxetine, the dose typically used to begin treatment of depression, was too small a dose 3 to modulate neuroplasticity
 It may also be that the training paradigm (new spectacles, patching, and 4 computerized perceptual training) was so effective that the 20-mg dose of fluoxetine did not provide any 5 additional benefit
 Larger fluoxetine doses (up to 80 mg/day) are often used in depressed patients when the 6 initial dose does not have the desired therapeutic effect
 In addition, the 10-week treatment period may 7 have been too short to maximize fluoxetine benefits and it is possible that a difference between treatment 8  Although there is evidence that some amblyopia treatments may be additive (optical correction in 10 combination with patching or atropine)32, some reports have documented that all amblyopia treatment 11 effects may not be additive
 The effects of multiple amblyopia treatment paradigms were not synergistic in 12 rodent models of amblyopia
42 Furthermore, environmental enrichment and fluoxetine treatment have been 13 shown to induce similar levels of amblyopia recovery in rodents
28 Therefore, it is possible that perceptual 14 training alone (with refractive correction) promotes the maximum amount visual cortex plasticity and that 15 further treatments do not have additive benefits
 The current study was not designed to determine this and 16 future studies should include a group of subjects only treated with fluoxetine (no perceptual training)
 17 However, a rodent study found that fluoxetine alone had no effect on vision
18 Furthermore, there are no 18 prior reports of visual benefits from fluoxetine monotherapy in amblyopic patients, even though millions 19 of patients, and presumably thousands of amblyopic patients, have used the medication over the past three 20 decades
 In addition, a recent placebo-controlled, double-blinded, clinical study showed that 20 mg/day of 21 fluoxetine for 19 days did not significantly affect visual perceptual learning in humans
43 These prior 22 studies support the theory that 20 mg/day of fluoxetine may not be a large enough dose to effectively 23  Subjects in the current study received new spectacles with the proper refractive correction at baseline

 ;    study
 However, adults have lower plasticity than children so the effects of glasses may have been less 1 prominent in our adult population
 Furthermore, test-retest variability should be taken into account; this 2 was low in the present study because visual acuity was measured under the same conditions and in the 3 same locations by the same observers
 Moreover, regression to the mean must be taken into account; 4 because our study was placebo-controlled, the regression to the mean was reduced because both groups 5  We found that training compliance was well correlated with improved visual acuity
 Therefore, the 7 training software used in the current study could potentially be used in the clinical setting to personalize 8 training and remotely monitor patient compliance
 This would allow clinicians to adjust follow-up 9 intervals based on treatment response rates
 Understanding early treatment responses would also aid in 10 determining which patients are likely to benefit from treatment and would allow for adjustment or 11 discontinuation of treatment on the basis of individual responses
 If no improvement is detected despite 12 good compliance, treatment may be discontinued and the diagnosis of amblyopia may need to be 13 reconsidered
 Follow-up visit schedules can also be determined based on perceptual training performance
 14  Our study had several limitations
 First, we did not have a true no-treatment control group
 However, in 15 both the placebo and fluoxetine groups, perceptual training compliance was well correlated with the 16 magnitude of vision improvement
 This finding strongly suggests that perceptual training resulted in 17 neuroplasticity and subsequent visual benefits
 Future clinical trials should include several control groups 18 to examine the effects of individual interventions and their combined effects
 Furthermore, the dose of 19 fluoxetine and duration of its use should be varied in these studies
 Second, the response to treatment was 20 remarkably variable in both treatment groups
 This may have resulted from the large amount of variation 21 in amblyopia severity and etiology in our study population
 Twenty-two subjects (
4%) had abnormal 22 binocularity at baseline, 10 of which had improvements in binocularity with study treatment
 In addition, 23 only 2 subjects with severe amblyopia had low contrast sensitivity at baseline
 Contrast sensitivity deficits 24 are sometimes found to correlate with the visual acuity in the amblyopic eye
 
 Both subjects exhibited 25 remarkable improvements in visual test results

 Hussain et al50 1 found a significant association between reduction in crowding and visual acuity improvement in 2 amblyopic adults

 It should be noted that the number of subjects in these 4 subgroups was relatively small and that larger subgroups may have revealed additional statistically 5  In conclusion, both fluoxetine and the software-based perceptual training were safe and well-tolerated, 7 with fluoxetine treatment not offering further benefits over perceptual training
 The training software used 8 in the study simultaneously determined training compliance and improvements in visual function and 9 showed that good training compliance is essential for treatment benefit
 Therefore, software-based 10 training, combined with eye patching, may improve visual function in adult patients with amblyopia

 Study 5 inclusion and exclusion criteria are fully described in Table 
 Briefly, adult patients with monocular 6 amblyopia with no other ocular or neurological abnormalities were considered for enrollment
 Included 7 subjects were 19 to 57 years of age and had moderate (
 
6 logMAR difference) to severe (>
6 8 logMAR difference) amblyopia due to myopic or hyperopic anisometropia (
25 D) or congenital 9 esotropia
 The lower limit for anisometropia was not set in the study protocol
 The investigators 10 considered the amblyopia to be of the anisometropic type if no strabismus had been diagnosed in 11 childhood and the refractive error was at least 1 D of anisometropia, determined as the spherical 12 equivalent, in childhood
 Patients with other primary forms of strabismus, extrafoveal (eccentric) fixation, 13 or who used antidepressant drugs in the past 6 months were excluded
  14 Eligibility, demographic data, medical history, relevant medication, vital signs, physical examination, 17 blood and urine samples (including urine pregnancy test for fertile women), and amblyopia were assessed 18 at screening
 Amblyopia was confirmed at screening and was defined as an interocular ETDRS best-19 corrected visual acuity difference of at least two lines and/or a logMAR visual acuity between 
30 and 20 
10 in the amblyopic eye and 
10 or better in the dominant eye
 Prior to randomization, patients received 21 new spectacles based on non-cycloplegic refraction to ensure best-corrected vision during the study
 22  A thorough ophthalmic examination was conducted at each of the seven scheduled visits (at 23 weeks -2 (screening), 0 (randomization), 2, 6, 10, 14 and 22; Figure 1) during the 26-week study period
 24 Vision tests included the assessment of binocularity, visual acuity, crowded near visual acuity, and 25 contrast sensitivity and were performed with the refractive error corrected
 In addition, presbyopic 26 correction was used for crowded near visual acuity testing in presbyopic subjects

 ;    Binocularity was examined using the Bagolini striated glass test51 before monocular testing
 Lens 1 striations were placed at 135 before the right eye and 45 before the left eye using lorgnette frames
 This 2 testing setup allows each eye to receive the same fusible image with each fixation streak oriented 3 perpendicular to the striations and 90 away from the other eye
 The test enables the evaluation of 4 simultaneously perceived images with a minimal dissociative effect and it was performed at near (33 cm) 5 and distance (4 m) under normal lighting conditions
 Binocularity was categorized as suppression (1 light 6 and only 1 line were seen), normal fusion (binocular single vision, BSV; 2 lines were seen as X and 1 light 7 at the center), anomalous retinal correspondence (ARC; harmonious if 1 light and 2 lines were seen, but 8 one of the lines was broken due to foveal suppression, or inharmonious if 1 light and 2 lines were seen, 9 but the lines did not cross at the center where the light was located) or diplopia (2 lights and 2 lines were 10 seen)
 However, none of the subjects had diplopia in the current study
 11  Visual acuity was assessed under standardized lighting conditions (self-calibrated test lighting with a 12 constant light level of 85 cd/m2) using a large-format standardized ETDRS light box (ESV3000 with LED 13 lights, VectorVision, Greenville, OH) placed 4 meters from the subject
 Three different ETDRS charts 14 (charts R, 1 and 2) were used to prevent subjects from memorizing eye charts
 Visual acuity was assessed 15 in the amblyopic eye first and was measured as the number of correctly identified letters
 A clinically 16 relevant visual acuity improvement was defined as a 
2 or greater decrease in the logarithm of the 17 minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity (i

 ;     Treatment safety was assessed using ophthalmoscopy, biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure (IOP) 1 measurement, laboratory safety tests [hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte count, leukocyte 2 count, platelet count), clinical chemistry (alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate 3 aminotransferase, creatinine, gamma-glutamyl transferase, potassium, sodium, urea), and urine analysis 4 (blood, glucose, ketones, protein, pH)], vital signs, and physical examination performed at screening and 5 at each study visit
 Adverse events and changes in concomitant medications were recorded at each study 6 Fluoxetine capsules were manufactured by Orion Corporation (Espoo, Finland) and the matching placebo 10 capsules were manufactured by Corden Pharma GmbH (Plankstadt, Germany)
 Study subjects were 11 randomly assigned to receive either 20 mg fluoxetine each day (hard capsule) or a matching placebo
 12 Randomization was done in a 1:1 fashion in blocks of 4 and was stratified by site
 Randomization was also 13 stratified by amblyopia severity, determined using interocular visual acuity difference (moderate: 
 -
6 14 logMAR difference, severe: >
6 logMAR difference)
 The randomization structure was designed by a 15 biostatistician and the final randomization list was generated by an independent person who had no 16 contact with study subjects or study data
 Medication was pre-packed and serially numbered so that 17 subjects were assigned to a study group by giving them the next available medication number in the 18 sequence
 A drug accountability log was maintained by study-authorized personnel
 The receipt, dispense 19 and return of study medication was recorded in this log
 Patients were instructed to return dispensed 20 medication bottles at the next visit, even if the bottles were empty
 The number of capsules dispensed and 21 returned was reconciled against the number of days between the visits and any discrepancies were 22 accounted for
 After 10 weeks of receiving study medication, subjects were weaned off the daily 23 medication (1 capsule every other day for the next 2 weeks, Figure B)

 ;    All subjects completed daily computerized training with eye patching during the 10-week period of 1 receiving study medication (Figure A)
 The principle underlying the perceptual training software 2 developed for this study is fully described in the Electronic Supplementary Materials and is illustrated in 3 Figure 2 and Supplementary video 
 All subjects received new spectacles before randomization and were 4 instructed to wear an eye patch over their dominant eye while performing daily computerized perceptual 5 training
 The training software was used to track training compliance, which was calculated by dividing 6 the total accomplished training time with the total prescribed training time
 Training compliance was 7 automatically reported to the study site prior to each scheduled visit
 8  All subjects were given an eye patch and were instructed to wear it over the non-amblyopic eye for 9 1 hour each day
 Subjects were also instructed to complete approximately 30 minutes of the computer-10 based training each day while they were wearing the patch and their spectacles
 11  The training period was divided into ten 1-week segments and each subject played an identical 12 composition of games each week
 The maximum total training time over the 10-week training period was 13 35 hours
 The training program was made up of seven different games wherein the performance was 14 primarily determined by visual acuity and contrast sensitivity and secondarily by attention and mental 15 effort
 Thus, the training was primarily focused on visual acuity and contrast sensitivity and was aimed at 16 their improvement
 A schematic illustration of the training game task design and composition is shown in 17 Figure 
 In addition, the computerized training setup, training protocol structure, and individual training 18 game design are described in detail in the Electronic Supplementary Materials
 Data on behavioral 19 performance were collected on a per-game basis
 For each game type, the corresponding weekly test 20 outcome measures were obtained by pooling the data from all individual games of that type played in that 21 The primary outcome of the study was an improvement in visual acuity in the amblyopic eye, as measured 25 by the ETDRS chart, from baseline (week 0, randomization) to the 10-week visit (end of treatment)
 26 Secondary outcomes included the change from baseline in binocularity, contrast sensitivity and crowded 27 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 The persistence of changes observed at 10 weeks was also evaluated 1 at the end of the follow-up period (week )
 Treatment safety was assessed using adverse event incidence 2 and ophthalmological examination findings throughout the study
 Exploratory outcomes included changes 3 from baseline in training measures at each study visit
    4 The primary analysis population was the full analysis dataset (FAS), which included all randomized 7 patients who had received at least one dose of study medication (intention-to-treat principle)
 A last 8 observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation was applied up to week 10 for subjects who did not 9 complete the study and those who were non-compliant with the treatment
 10  Differences in visual acuity and crowded near visual acuity between the two treatment groups were 11 evaluated using the repeated measurements of analysis of covariance (RM ANCOVA) method with 12 baseline values as a covariate
 The model included the study center, treatment and time point (visit) as 13 main effects, and treatment by time point (visit) as an interaction effect
 With regard to the primary 14 endpoint, differences between the treatment groups with regards to change in the logMAR visual acuity at 15 10 weeks (and a 95% CI for the difference) were estimated using RM ANCOVA models with a contrast
 16 A secondary RM ANCOVA analysis was used to compare the least square means between the treatment 17 groups at the end of the follow-up (22 weeks) period to determine if treatment effects were maintained
 18 Contrast sensitivity was not analyzed with RM models because of low variability in the dataset
 Pearsons 19 chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables
 Some binocularity categories contained a low 20 number of subjects
 Therefore, differences between treatment groups in binocularity were evaluated using 21 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Schematic illustration of the training game task design and composition
 For details, please 6 see Materials and Methods section: Training paradigm
 In short, the training program comprised seven 7 different games, Games 1-7, that tapped primarily on visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in multiple 8 attentional and working memory tasks
 Subjects were presented with a pre-determined selection of games 9 for each training day
 The total training duration per week was ~
5 h, excluding the time spent on game 10 parameter adaptation
 In all tasks, the subject responded with a single keyboard-button press or withheld 11 the response
 Games 1 and 2 were single- or multi-object visual tracking tasks where complex shaped 12 objects moved along curved paths on screen and the subjects task was to respond whenever they observed 13 a feature-change in any of the objects
 Different game segments exhibited different numbers of to-be 14 attended objects (attentional loads 1, 2, 3, and )
 Prior to each game, there was a calibration period with 15 one (Game 1) or two (Game 2) objects during which the magnitude of the feature change (C) was adjusted 16 to yield a detection rate (HR) of -%
 Games 3 and 4 were visual-tracking games like Games 1 and 2 17 and had an identical calibration procedure and object mobility, but involved only attentional loads of 1 and 18 2, and exhibited in two out of four conditions six feature-wise distinct distractor objects to impose visual 19 crowding
 Game 5 was a continuous single-object tracking task where the subjects reported the feature 20 changes of a single object (as in Games -)
 Game 5 had no calibration but rather started with very 21 salient feature changes that in each of the 12 game segments decreased by a factor of 
6 so that the 22 subjects on average were able to reach segments 7-8 at a detection rate of >%
 Game 6 was a Go/No-23 Go 1-back working memory task where the subject was presented stimuli with an object in one quadrant 24 lasting ~1 s at a rate of one stimulus in ~
5 s
 The subjects task was to indicate whether the object in the 25 current stimulus was different from the one in the previous stimulus regardless of quadrant and object 26 rotation
 Game 7 was a threshold-stimulus-detection task where semi-transparent complex visual objects 27 certified by peer review) is the author/funder
