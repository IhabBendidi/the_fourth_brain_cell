 ;    HIV-1 cure research seeks to decrease or eliminate the latent reservoir
 The evaluation of such curative strategies requires accurate measures of the reservoir
 Gaebler et al describe a combined multicolor qPCR and next generation sequencing method that enables the sensitive and specific HIV-1 infection requires life-long therapy with anti-retroviral drugs due to the existence of a latent reservoir of transcriptionally inactive integrated proviruses
 The goal of HIV-1 cure research is to eliminate or functionally silence this reservoir
 To this end there are numerous ongoing studies to of these studies requires sensitive and specific measures of the reservoir
 Here we describe a relatively high throughput combined quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and next generation sequencing method
 Four different qPCR probes covering the packaging signal (PS), group-specific antigen (gag), polymerase (pol), and envelope (env) are combined in a single multiplex reaction to detect the HIV-1 genome in limiting dilution samples followed by sequence verification of individual reactions that are positive for combinations of any 2 of the 4 probes (QPCR)

 ;    Like other retroviruses, HIV-1 integrates into the host genome where it is transcribed to produce infectious virions (Craigie and Bushman, )
 Productive infection typically leads to cell death, however, in a small number of CD4+ T cells the integrated virus is silenced and becomes latent
 Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is highly effective in suppressing HIV-1 infection and preventing disease progression, however, cART does not eliminate the virus due to the existence of the latent reservoir (Chun et al, 1997; Finzi et al, 1997; Wong et al, )
 Longitudinal studies performed on individuals on cART indicate that the latent reservoir has a half-life of 44 months (Chun et al, 1999; Siliciano et al, )
 Thus, treatment interruption leads almost invariably to rapid viral rebound and therapy with cART is required for the lifetime of the infected individual An important goal for HIV-1 research is to achieve a functional remission or cure by decreasing or eliminating the latent reservoir, and a number of clinical trials have been designed to test new approaches to this problem (Caskey et al, 2019; Cillo and Mellors, 2016; Gruell and Klein, 2018; Margolis et al, )
 The evaluation of HIV-1 curative strategies requires sensitive, specific and precise assays to quantify and characterize the latent HIV-1 reservoir
 Yet, to date most approaches show major discrepancies in infected cell frequencies (Eriksson et al, 2013; Sengupta and Siliciano, )
 These inconsistencies constrain the accurate assessment of HIV-1 cure efforts and could obscure a meaningful intervention (Henrich et al, 2017; Sengupta and Siliciano, )

 We compare the new method to quantitative and qualitative viral outgrowth assays (Q2VOA) and near full-length (NFL) sequencing on paired peripheral blood samples obtained at 2 time points from the same 6 individuals enrolled in a clinical trial that involved analytical treatment interruption (ATI) after infusion of a combination of two broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Lu et al, 2018; Mendoza et al, )
 To select primer/probe sets that maximize detection of HIV-1 we analyzed four previously characterized candidates in silico using intact proviral genomes from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database (Bruner and Siliciano, 2018; Bruner et al, 2019; Palmer et al, 2003; Schmid et al, )
 The selected primer/probes cover conserved regions in the HIV-1 genome including the packaging signal (PS), group-specific antigen (gag), polymerase (pol), and envelope (env) (Fig
 S)
 Allowing for 1 and up to 4 mismatches (3 mismatches at the 5 end and 1 mismatch at the 3 end) in probes and primers respectively the PS, gag, pol and env primer/probes detected 72%, 83%, 94% and 92% of 578 intact clade B sequences in the Los Alamos HIV sequence database (Fig
 1A and Fig
 S2) (Lefever et al, 2013; Rutsaert et al, 2018; Stadhouders et al, )
 All genomes scored positive with at least one of the four primer/probe sets
 Notably, the large majority (99%) of genomes were positive for at least one of the many combinations of two primer/probe sets
 However, any single 2 probe combination was at best 86% sensitive (pol+env)
 To test whether these primer/probe sets can discriminate between intact and defective proviruses we also performed the same in silico analysis on 1378 intact and defective HIV-1 sequences from certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    9 individuals that received a combination of two broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies during treatment interruption (Lu et al, )
 In six out of nine patients we observed HIV-1 sequence polymorphisms that cause a predicted loss of signal for at least one of the primer/probe sets (Fig
 B)
 For example, intact viruses in individuals 9241, 9242, 9244, 9246 and 9255 are predicted to be negative for the PS primer/probe set
 In addition to the problem of sensitivity, 2 probe combinations also have a potential problem with specificity since a number of defective viruses were predicted to be positive for several of the 2 probe combinations tested
 The potential magnitude of this problem varies with the probe combination and the individual analyzed
 For example, in 9252 80% of the viruses detected with the PS+env combination are defective, whereas in 9243 its 35% (Fig B)
 Thus, the in silico data suggest that any single combination of 2 probes would not be sufficient for sensitive and specific reservoir measurements due to HIV-1 sequence To accommodate HIV-1 sequence diversity we developed a multiplex qPCR strategy for simultaneous detection of 4 probes, PS, gag, pol, and env using a 384-well format (QPCR)
 Using this approach we analyzed samples from 2 separate time points from 6 individuals enrolled in a clinical trial that involved analytical treatment interruption after infusion of a combination of two broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Lu et al, 2018; Mendoza et al, )
  Proviral genomes were amplified from DNA extracted from purified CD4+ T cells obtained 2 weeks before (wk-2) and 12 weeks (wk12) after treatment interruption
 To determine overall HIV-1 proviral frequency, genomic DNA from CD4+ T cells was assayed for gag by qPCR

 DNA from CD4+ T cells was diluted to a concentration equivalent to single copy of gag per reaction and assayed by Q4PCR (Fig
 )
 Individual reactions containing a single proviral copy were amplified to produce near full-length and subgenomic proviruses using 5 of gag and LTR primers (Ho et al, 2013; Li et al, )
 Individual amplicons were then tested for reactivity with each of the 4 qPCR probes
 Participant 9254 was excluded from the quantitative analysis because of inadequate sample availability
 The number of samples showing reactivity with any one of the selected HIV-1 probes after near full-length amplification was similar (
5-fold lower) to the number predicted from short segment gag qPCR performed before the amplification indicating that near full-length genome PCR There was substantial variation between individuals (see below), but the median frequency of proviruses reactive to 2 or more probes was 94 X 10-6 CD4+ T cells or approximately 4x less than gag DNA alone
 The frequency of proviruses that scored positive with at least 3 or all 4 probes was lower still at 19 X 10-6 and 1 X 10-6 CD4+ T cells (Fig
 3A and Table S)
  To determine which of the proviruses detected by Q4PCR were intact we performed next generation sequencing (Fig
 )

 All other samples showing reactivity with 2 or more of 1832 proviruses were sequenced
 On average we obtained 153 proviral sequences per time point per participant
 Proviral sequences were scored as intact if they did not have deletions or insertions, were in frame, did not contain stop codons, and had intact packaging signals and major splice donors (MSDs) (Fig
 S)
 In total we found 237 intact and 1595 defective proviral sequences
 Intact proviruses were found at a median frequency of 
8X10-6 CD4+ T cells, a nearly 20-fold lower frequency than proviruses reacting with 2 or more qPCR probes (Fig 3A and B)
 NFL sequencing and Q2VOA performed on the same samples showed 2-fold and 
6-fold fewer intact and inducible proviruses per million CD4+ T cells than Q4PCR respectively (Lu et al, 2018; Mendoza et al, 2018)  (Fig
 3B and Table S)
  Despite the limited sample size, there was a significant correlation between the number of viruses measured by outgrowth assays and Q4PCR (Fig C)
 Furthermore, the detection of intact proviruses by Q4PCR was highly reproducible
 In two sets of independent experiments performed on samples from 4 individuals there was a strong agreement (Pearson r=
7764, P=
0235) consistent with 
5-fold variability in the assay (Fig

 To compare the intact proviruses obtained by Q4PCR with those obtained by Q2VOA and NFL sequencing we created Euler diagrams and phylogenetic trees using env sequences (Lu et al, 2018; Mendoza et al, 2018) (Fig
 4A, Fig

 In line with our previous observations from both Q2VOA and NFL sequencing, the new Q4PCR sequencing strategy was unable to detect a sequence match between intact proviral sequences and rebound viruses obtained by single genome analysis (SGA) at the To determine how integrated HIV-1 varied between individuals and time points within an individual we analyzed both defective and intact proviruses (Fig
 4B and Table S)
 Defective viruses were further divided into those with defective packaging signals or MSDs, hypermutation, indels or nonsense mutations, and large deletions
 The distribution of defective and intact viruses was relatively constant between the 2 time points in each individual with the exception of 9252 who showed a relative decrease in the number of intact proviruses and an increased representation of proviruses with defective packaging signals or MSDs between weeks -2 and 
 Overall, large internal deletions were the most frequent source of defective proviruses followed by packaging site and/or MSD defects, indel/nonsense mutations and hypermutation
 However, the contribution of intact proviruses and individual categories of defects varied significantly between individuals
 For example, when the 2 time points are combined the fraction of intact proviruses in individual To examine individual probes and probe combinations for their ability to identify intact proviruses, we compared sequencing results with qPCR and determined the predictive value of each probe

 ;    The positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that a sample that is reactive with a specific probe or combination of probes is associated with an intact proviral sequence
   Of a total of 1832 samples assayed, the majority were positive for only 2 (n=908) followed by 3 (n=615), 1 (n=270) and 4 (n=39) probe signals (Fig
 A)
 Notably, no sample with an isolated single probe signal was associated with an intact proviral sequence, and only 6% of all samples that were positive for any combination of 2 probes contained intact proviruses
 In contrast, 26% and 51% of all samples that were reactive with any combination of 3 or 4 probes respectively contained intact proviruses
 Thus, the positive predictive value is directly correlated to the number To determine the contribution of combinations of individual probes, we determined the sensitivity and PPV for all possible probe combinations
 Notably, whereas an isolated env signal fails to predict intact proviruses, env in combination with any other probe shows a very high sensitivity for the detection of intact proviruses, 98% of 237 intact sequences were env+
 In contrast, the sensitivity of either pol, or PS or gag with any other probe was lower, 39%, 65% and 83% The combination of PS+env has the highest, and gag+pol the lowest positive predictive value of any 2 probe combinations (62% and 
4% respectively, Fig 5D and Table S)
 However, even the PS+env combination has a substantial false discovery rate
 Overall 38% of PS+env positive samples are associated with defective proviral sequences, and 2 of the 6 individuals failed to show any signal with the PS primer/probe set (Fig
 6 and Table S)

 ;    of the signal was predicted and could be explained by sequence polymorphisms in proviral genomes (Fig
1B and Fig
 S)
 Thus, polymorphisms limit the applicability of a diagnostic test based on any two probes including PS+env
 Moreover, even in those individuals where the PS+env combination was effective, the positive predictive value varied from 
1% to 96% between Samples positive for at least 3 probes show considerable improved predictive values
 For example, samples that were positive for at least PS+gag+env predict intact proviruses at a rate of 78% (Fig D)
 However, the requirement for hybridization with a third or fourth probe decreases the sensitivity of the assay and results in inability to detect 24% and 92% of all positive samples respectively, an effect that appears to be due to HIV-1 sequence variation (Table S)
  Only the combination of any two Q4PCR primer/probe sets and next generation sequencing is both sensitive Accurate measurement of the size of the circulating latent reservoir is essential for evaluating therapeutic interventions that aim to eliminate it (Sengupta and Siliciano, )
 The combination of Q4PCR and next generation sequencing is a relatively high throughput method that is both Several methods have been used to evaluate the latent HIV-1 reservoir
 For example, total integrated proviral DNA can be measured by polymerase chain reaction using gag specific primers (Bieniasz et al, 1993; Christopherson et al, 2000; Palmer et al, )

 However, it does not distinguish between rare replication-competent and more abundant replication-defective proviruses (Bruner et al, 2016; Eriksson et al, 2013; Ho et al, )
 Thus, the overwhelming background of defective proviruses would make any change in the replication competent latent reservoir difficult to detect using this assay
 Viral outgrowth assays measure infectious viruses that can be recovered by CD4+ T cell activation in vitro (Chun et al, 1997; Lorenzi et al, )
 However, these assays are very labor intensive, variable and not sensitive to any change below a factor of 6 (Crooks et al, 2015; Rosenbloom et al, )
 In addition, these assays selectively underestimate the reservoir because only a fraction of latently infected cells can be induced after a single round of stimulation in vitro (Ho et al, 2013; Hosmane Sequencing near full-length proviral genomes from limiting dilution CD4+ T cell DNA samples allows relatively unbiased characterization of the proviral reservoir (Hiener et al, 2017; Ho et al, 2013; Lu et al, )
 This technique is very labor intensive and requires interrogation of thousands of reactions per sample making these studies challenging
 In addition there is some variation between the number of estimated intact genomes measured by DNA sequencing assays based on Sanger and next generation sequencing technologies  12-114 X 10-6 (Bruner et al, 2016; Ho et al, 2013) vs
 
8-24 X 10-6 CD4+ T cells (Hiener et al, 2017; Lee et al, 2017; Lu et al, 2018; Sharaf et al, 2018; Vibholm et al, )
 One possible explanation for the observed difference is the use of an empirical Bayesian model to estimate the number of intact proviral genomes in the Sanger-based studies necessitated by the absence of detected intact genomes in 13 out of 26 subjects (Bruner et al, 2016; Ho et al, )

 ;    Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA) is a high throughput method to measure integrated proviral DNA using droplet digital PCR to probe for the presence of PS+env in the proviral genome (Bruner et al, )
 This method detects intact proviruses at a higher frequency than the sequencing methods (100 X 10-6 CD4+ T cells) (Bruner et al, )
 The IPDA relies on amplification of two subgenomic regions that together sample 222bp or only 2% of the 
7kb HIV-1 genome
 As a result, a significant fraction of proviruses are incorrectly categorized as intact which leads to an overestimation of intact proviral DNA (Bruner et al, )
 Moreover, our experiments indicate that polymorphisms lead to variation in the levels of sensitivity and specificity of the PS+env probe combination in different individuals suggesting that any single combination of 2 probes would not be sufficient for broadly applicable reservoir measurements
 Most importantly, verification of intact proviruses is not possible in the IPDA and therefore the accuracy of this method will vary between individuals depending on the molecular composition of the reservoir
 Nevertheless, the IPDA is a high throughput assay that is more accurate than the total proviral DNA assay, making it the most desirable currently available assay for large studies (Bruner et al, )
 The advantage of combining multicolor qPCR and sequencing is that the method is relatively rapid, scalable, and both sensitive and specific
 All intact viruses in the 6 individuals analyzed and 99% of the intact Clade B viral sequences in the Los Alamos data base were positive for any combination of 2 of the 4 probes in the Q4PCR reaction
 Bar coding and next generation sequencing facilitates the analysis of large numbers of samples simultaneously and enables definitive identification of intact proviruses
 In addition, the sequence data provides information on the clonal structure of the latent reservoir and on the nature of the defective proviruses

 Signal prediction for each individual proviral sequence is represented by the presence of the color of the respective primer/probe set
 Sequences containing polymorphisms that prevent signal detection are represented by the absence of color
 The percentage indicates the fraction of detected sequences for individual primer/probe sets or combinations of two primer/probe sets (brackets)
 (B) Horizontal bars represent the predicted detection of 401 intact and 977 defective near-full length genomes from 9 individuals (Lu et al, 2018; Mendoza et al, )
 The same primer/probe sets and color scheme is used as described above
 The group of defective sequences includes near-full length genomes that carry small insertions, deletions and defects in the packaging site and/or major splice donor

 Genomic DNA from CD4+ T cells was subjected to limiting dilution qPCR with a gag specific primer/probe set to determine overall HIV-1 proviral frequency
 Near full-length proviral genomes were amplified from CD4+ T cell genomic DNA in samples diluted to single copy concentrations based on gag qPCR
 An aliquot of the resulting amplicons was assayed by quadruplex qPCR using a combination of primer/probe sets covering certified by peer review) is the author/funder
