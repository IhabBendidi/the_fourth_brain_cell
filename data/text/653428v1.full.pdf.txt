 Instead, prosthesis users rely heavily on visual feedback, even though 17 state transitions that are necessary to skillfully interact with objects, such as object contact, are relayed 18 more precisely through tactile feedback
 Here we show that restoring tactile sensory feedback, 19 through intracortical microstimulation of the somatosensory cortex7, enables a person with a 20 bidirectional intracortical brain-computer interface to improve their performance on functional object 21 transport tasks completed with a neurally-controlled prosthetic limb
 The participant had full visual 22 feedback and had practiced the task for approximately two years prior to these experiments
 23 Nevertheless, successful trial times on a commonly used clinical upper limb assessment task were 24 reduced from a median time of 
9 s (
1 - 
5 s interquartile range) to 
2 s (
4 - 
1 s interquartile 25 range) when vision was supplemented with microstimulation-evoked cutaneous percepts that were 26 referred to different fingers and were graded in intensity based on real-time prosthesis contact forces
 27 Faster completion times were primarily due to a reduction in the amount of time spent attempting to 28 grasp objects
 These results demonstrate the importance of tactile sensations in upper-limb control and 29 the utility of creating bidirectional brain-computer interfaces to restore this stream of information using 30 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    We use our hands to interact with our environment, often by exploring and manipulating objects
 32 Without tactile somatosensory feedback, even simple manipulation tasks become clumsy and slow
 33 Outside of investigational settings, this source of feedback is rarely provided for prosthetic devices8, and 34 in the context of human brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), has only recently become possible,
 These 35 studies have begun to describe the perceptual characteristics of cortical stimulation, however, the 36 potential benefits of a bidirectional BCI on function have remained unexplored
 This is despite the fact 37 that the need for somatosensory feedback in BCIs has long been suggested as the next step towards 38 complete upper-limb restoration1214 and cited by amputees as a desired feature
 Here we show that 39 a bidirectional BCI (Fig
 1) that provides these tactile percepts improves performance in functional object 40 transport tasks using a BCI-controlled robotic arm
 The percepts were driven in real-time by sensors in a 41 prosthetic hand (Fig
 1c,d), evoked through intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of area 1 of 42 somatosensory cortex (S1) and experienced by a participant as originating from his own palm and 43 We used two tasks to evaluate performance: an object transfer task (Fig
 1f) and a modified version of 45 the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)18 (Fig
 g)
 Both tasks were completed using the Modular Prosthetic 46 Limb (MPL)
 The robotic arm was controlled using neural activity recorded from two 88-channel 47 microelectrode arrays implanted chronically in primary motor cortex (M1) (Fig
 1b) of a human 48 participant with tetraplegia resulting from a cervical spinal cord injury
 Five degrees-of-freedom (DoF), 49 consisting of 3D endpoint translation, pronation/supination of the wrist, and hand grasp aperture (Fig
 50 1a)with the hand in a power grasp conformationwere continuously and simultaneously controlled by 51 the participant during all tasks (Fig
 e)
 Tactile feedback was delivered in the first four experimental 52 sessions by ICMS through two 32-channel microelectrode arrays implanted in area 1 of S1 (Fig
 b)
 53 Stimulation pulses were delivered at 100 pulses per second and pulse amplitude was modulated linearly 54 by the reaction torques measured at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the fingers on the MPL (Fig
 d)
 55 Pulse trains were delivered to electrodes which, when stimulated, evoked percepts on corresponding 56 We first tested the effect of providing ICMS-induced tactile feedback on functional performance using 58 an object transfer task that was familiar to the participant

 1f) as many times as possible in two minutes (Supplemental Video )
 We 60 compared the number of transfers completed during four sessions with ICMS to four sessions without 61 ICMS
 Each session consisted of five two-minute trials
 Across a total of 20 trials with ICMS, 352 transfers 62 were completed compared to 315 transfers in the 20 trials without ICMS (Table )
 The number of 63 transfers increased from 
8  
8 transfers per trial to 
8  
4 transfers per trial with ICMS, though 64 this difference was not statistically significant (t38 = -
02, P = 
050, t-test)
 However, we observed 65 qualitative improvements during the task that led us to examine the data in more detail
 66 The object transfer task can be broken up into grasp, transport and release phases
 We defined these 67 phases using the physical location of the MPL hand
 The transport zone consisted of a region 
5 cm 68 wide and centered on the starting location of the hand at the beginning of a trial The grasp zone was 69 located to the left side of the transport zone, while the release zone was located to the right (Fig
 f)
 70 We first examined the amount of time spent in each movement zone per transfer
 We found that the 71 time spent in the grasp zone decreased from 
3  
2 s per transfer without ICMS to 
3  
4 s per 72 transfer with ICMS (t38 = 
3, P = 
002, t-test, Fig
 2a) while time spent in the release zone decreased 73 from 
8  
0 s per transfer without ICMS to 
3  
5 s per transfer with ICMS (t38 = 
0, P = 
048, t-74 test, Fig
 a)
 Time spent in the transport zone per transfer was no different with or without ICMS (
1  75 
6 s without ICMS, 
3  
3 s with ICMS, t38 = -
3, P = 
206, t-test, Fig
 a)
 To uncover the reason 76 behind the lower grasp times with ICMS, we examined the total distance travelled while the MPL was in 77 the grasp zone
 We found that there was significantly more movement in the grasp zone in trials without 78 ICMS compared to trials with ICMS (
2  
1 cm/transfer without ICMS, 
4  
9 cm/transfer with 79 ICMS, t38 = 
7, P = 
0007, t-test, Fig
 b)
 This suggests that in trials without ICMS, the additional time 80 was used to move the hand into an ideal configuration to grasp the object
 This effect is further 81 illustrated by comparing the spatial distributions of time spent across the workspace per transfer (Fig
 82 c)
 With ICMS-evoked sensations, the participant spent less time in the immediate vicinity of the object
 83 We then compared performance on a modified version of the ARAT18, which is a clinically validated test 84 of unilateral upper-limb function and one that has been used previously to assess arm control 85 performance in BCI systems,
 We placed different objects on the left side of the workspace, one at a 86 time, and asked the participant to grasp the object and place it on a raised platform on the right side of 87 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 A score of three was awarded if 88 the task was completed in under five seconds, a score of two was awarded if the task was completed in 89 under two minutes and a score of one was awarded if the object was touched but the task was not 90 completed in two minutes
 A score of zero was awarded otherwise
 Each of the nine objects were 91 attempted three times, for a total of 27 trials per ARAT session
 The final score was the sum of the best 92 Prior to these experiments, the participant had performed 23 ARAT sessions over a period of 23 months 94 using several different control schemes, including four preliminary sessions with ICMS-driven tactile 95 feedback (Fig
 a)
 These four exploratory sessions included ICMS, but did not have consistent mapping 96 between finger torque feedback and stimulation parameters
 Further, these sessions were intermixed 97 with sessions without ICMS rather than being performed consecutively with fixed parameters as in our 98 final experimental design
 Over these 23 sessions, performance had plateaued, with a median ARAT 99 score of 18 and an interquartile range (IQR) of 
25  19 (Fig
 a)
 We then began collecting data to 100 compare the effect of ICMS on ARAT performance
 In the first block of four sequential sessionswhich 101 included ICMS, enabling our participant to feel tactile sensations perceived as originating from his own 102 hand when the robotic hand grasped an objecthis ARAT score increased significantly to a median of 21 103 and a range of 20  21 (U = 5, P = 
005, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Table 1, Fig
 a)
 Performance with 104 ICMS was also significantly better than the four subsequent matched control sessions without ICMS in 105 which he achieved a median ARAT score of 17 with a range of 16  19 (U = 0, P = 
029, Wilcoxon rank-106 sum test, Fig
 a)
 ARAT scores in these control sessions were no different than the 23 historical sessions 107 (U = 39, P = 
65, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig
 a)
 Individual session scores are shown in Table 
 Despite 108 the significantly improved scores in sessions with ICMS, there was no change in the total number of trials 109 that were successfully completed (U = 7, P = 
83, Wilcoxon rank-sum, Table )
 Therefore, the improved 110 ARAT scores occurred as a result of completing individual trials more quickly
 In the ARAT scoring system, 111 successfully transferring an object in less than five seconds, and achieving a score of three, is considered 112 normal, unimpaired performance
 In the absence of tactile sensations evoked by ICMS, a score of three 113 was achieved only once during the 4 sessions (108 trials)
 When tactile sensations were provided, a score 114 of three was attained 15 times during the 108 trials

 ;    Overall, we found that trials were consistently completed much more quickly when ICMS feedback was 116 delivered (Fig
 3b, Supplemental Video 2); 14% of the trials with ICMS-evoked tactile feedback were 117 completed more quickly than the fastest trial without ICMS
 In fact, discounting the single trial that was 118 completed in less than five seconds without ICMS, 25% of the trials with ICMS were completed more 119 quickly than trials without ICMS (Fig
 b)
 Successfully completed trial lengths decreased from a median 120 time of 
9 s (
1 - 
5 s IQR) to 
2 s (
4 - 
1 s IQR) when tactile feedback was provided (U = 121 1676, P < 
0001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Table 1, Fig
 3b and Supplemental Video )
 These faster 122 completion times were the cause of the 
5-point improvement in the ARAT score that occurred when 123 ICMS was provided and can be interpreted as meaning that ICMS-induced tactile sensations allowed 
5 124 more objects, out of 9 possible, to be transported to the platform in a normal time (< 5 seconds)
 The 125 improved times were not due to differences in the commanded velocities
 While the distributions of 126 translation velocity commands measured at each time step were statistically different between 127 conditions (D = 
02, P < 
0001, 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Extended Data Fig
 1), the velocities 128 were functionally equivalent
 The median translation velocity was 
7 cm/s (
5  
2 cm/s IQR) with 129 ICMS and 
4 cm/s (
4  
6 cm/s IQR) without ICMS
 Similar results were observed for wrist rotation 130 The ARAT task can be broadly divided into reach, grasp, and transport phases (Supplemental Video )
 132 We separated the trials into these three sequential task phases: (1) reach, consisting of movement onset 133 to first object contact; (2) grasp, consisting of first object contact to successful object liftoff; and (3) 134 transport, consisting of object liftoff to object release
 The median time spent reaching decreased from 135 
1 s (
5  
5 s IQR) without ICMS to 
5 s (
2  
3 s IQR) when ICMS was provided, representing a 136 
8% improvement (n = 78 without ICMS and n = 85 with ICMS, U = 2204, P = 
0002, Wilcoxon rank-137 sum test, Fig
 c)
 Likewise, the median time spent transporting the object decreased from 
9 s (
0  138 
0 s IQR) to 
1 s (
8  
0 s IQR), representing a 
3% improvement (n = 78 without ICMS and n = 85 139 with ICMS, U = 
5, P = 
002, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig
 c)
 Most impressively, the amount of 140 time spent attempting to grasp the object decreased from 
8 s (
2  
4 s IQR) without ICMS to 
8 141 s (
9  
5 s IQR) with ICMS, resulting in a 
7% improvement in performance (n = 78 without ICMS 142 and n = 85 with ICMS, U =

 Why the amount of time 146 spent in the other two phases decreased is less clear
 Since object contact and contact force cannot be 147 felt without ICMS, he may have taken longer positioning the hand to improve the amount of information 148 about object interaction he could extract visually, thus increasing the amount of time spent reaching
 149 For the transport phase, the participant may have been less confident about his grasp stability, causing 150 him to move more slowly during transport to avoid dropping the object
 151 By design, the objects in the ARAT task vary in size, shape, weight and, therefore, the overall difficulty in 152 grasping them
 As a result of the significant time spent practicing this task, the participant had classified 153 the nine ARAT objects as being either easy (5 cm cube, 
5 cm cube and sphere) or difficult (
5 cm cube, 154 10 cm cube, rock, small cylinder, large cylinder and water pouring) to complete
 All of the objects that 155 were rated as easy, as well as the 10 cm cube and large cylinder, were completed more quickly with 156 ICMS than without ICMS (Fig
 3d, Extended Data Table )
 Including ICMS did not significantly improve 157 perfomance with the rock, small cylinder or water pouring task although the median completion time 158 did go down for all of the objects
 Therefore, other factors, such as the controllable degrees of freedom 159 or kinematic constraints in the robotic arm, may have limited performance on these objects
 However, 160 for those objects that could be completed more easily, adding ICMS feedback further improved 161 Prior to conducting the functional tasks each session, BCI decoder performance was tested in the 163 absence of ICMS-evoked tactile feedback using a random target sequence task
 This task explicitly 164 measured how well the participant could independently control each DoF by moving to specific locations 165 in the 5 DoF workspace
 On the days when ICMS-evoked tactile feedback was not provided, sequence 166 task performance was slightly higher, achieving a median score of 100% on all four days compared to a 167 median of 95% (range 90-100%) on the days where ICMS was delivered during the functional tasks (12 168 scores per condition, U = 
5, P = 
025, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, median scores for individual sessions 169 in Table )
 This suggests that decoder performance itself, and thus the participants ability to control 170 the robotic arm, did not favor the days on which ICMS was provided

 ;    In many bidirectional upper-limb prosthetics studies where amputees receive restored sensory feedback 172 through electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerves, the effect of artificial sensations on performance 173 are measured without visual or auditory feedback,
 Our approach differed from these studies in 174 that our aim was to investigate the effect of providing artificial somatosensory feedback on tasks that 175 were already possible with existing sensory modalities, namely vision
 Here, we demonstrated that in 176 highly-practiced tasks where normal visual feedback was available, adding artificial tactile feedback 177 through ICMS enabled a person with spinal cord injury using a BCI to significantly improve their task 178 scores, primarily by spending less time attempting to grasp the objects (Fig
 2a,c, b,c)
 179 As with any single-subject study, it is uncertain whether these findings will generalize to future 180 experiments
 However, there are several reasons to believe that these results accurately represent the 181 potential of restoring somatosensory percepts using ICMS
 First, using the same fundamental neural 182 decoding and control methods, we have demonstrated that two participants achieved similar scores on 183 functional tasks with vision alone20,22 and that these scores were only exceeded when ICMS-evoked 184 tactile feedback was provided (Fig
 a)
 This suggests that without artificial tactile feedback, control is 185 impaired, much as it is when tactile sensations are absent in people with otherwise normal motor control 186 capabilities,
 Second, we found that performance improvements were driven primarily by reductions 187 in the time taken to successfully grasp an object
 State transitions, such as object contact5 during the 188 grasp phase, are uniquely encoded by tactile feedback in the intact nervous system
 That the percepts 189 signaled these state transitions with high temporal accuracy, and enabled him to grasp objects more 190 quickly, suggests that ICMS delivered to area 1 of S1 can improve task performance in a way that is 191 congruent to the way natural cutaneous feedback improves grasp performance
 Finally, when ICMS-192 induced percepts were provided, performance improved significantly, and when they were removed, 193 performance returned to pre-ICMS levels (Fig
 a)
 Therefore, these observations suggest that the 194 observed improvements were primarily due to the addition of reliable sensory information, rather than 195 the result of additional practice
 This immediate performance improvement also suggests that ICMS in 196 S1 was not akin to sensory substitution cues that could have been provided by electrical or mechanical 197 stimulation of intact skin or audio or visual cues, as the relationship between these cues and behavior 198 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 210 A 28-year-old male participant with tetraplegia due to a C5 motor/C6 sensory ASIA B spinal cord injury 211 was implanted with two sets of microelectrode arrays (Blackrock Microsystems, Inc
, Salt Lake City, Utah, 212 Fig
 b)
 Two intracortical microelectrode arrays with 88 wired channels (10x10 array, 
5 mm length 213 platinum electrodes) were implanted in the hand and arm region of M1 in order to decode movement 214 intent
 Two additional microelectrode arrays with 32 wired channels were implanted in area 1 of S1 215 (6x10 array, 
5 mm length and coated with a sputtered iridium oxide film) in order to evoke sensations 216 in the fingers of the right hand when stimulated
 The study sessions described here took place between 217 Voltage recordings from each electrode were band-pass filtered between 
3 Hz and 
5 kHz and 220 digitized at 30,000 samples per second using a NeuroPort signal processor (Blackrock Microsystems, Inc

 Electrical artifacts induced by microstimulation were rejected using a combination 222 of digital signal blanking and filtering
 During each stimulus pulse the recorded signals were blanked 223 using a sample-and-hold circuit
 The signals were then high-pass filtered using a 750 Hz first-order 224 Butterworth filter that minimized the effect of additional transient discontinuities in the signal, enabling 225 fast settling of the wideband signal to baseline

 Using this approach, we were able to 228 record single unit activity within 740 s of the end of a stimulus pulse
 229 To investigate the ability of the participant to use ICMS-evoked tactile percepts during continuous 231 control of a prosthesis, we first created a mapping between population-level neural firing rates recorded 232 in M1 and desired arm movements
 A 5 DoF decoder was used in this study, comprising translation of 233 the endpoint in 3D space, wrist pronation and supination, and flexion and extension of all fingers and 234 the thumb, with the thumb always opposite the fingers
 All 5 DoFs were controlled simultaneously
 A 5 235 DoF control scheme was chosen as it provided a balance between fast training times and a sufficient 236 degree of dexterity to grasp the different objects used in these experiments
 237 To train the decoder, the participant observed a virtual version of the Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL)19 238 moving in a 3D environment, as has been described previously
 In this task, the participant was asked 239 to observe and imagine performing the motions of the MPL as the hand was first translated, then 240 oriented, and finally commanded to grasp targets that were randomly presented throughout the 241 workspace using a combination of virtual objects and auditory cues
 After observing the completion of 242 27 trials, which took approximately 7 minutes, an optimal linear estimator decoder was derived using an 243 encoding model that relates neural firing rates to arm kinematics
 The encoding model was: 244 	 = 	% 	+	'' 	+	)) 	+	** +	++ +	,,  (Equation 1) 245 where f is the square-root transformed firing rate of a recorded unit, v is a kinematic velocity, and b is a 246 regression coefficient for a given velocity dimension
 The dimensions shown in Equation 1 are x, y, and z 247 translation, wrist rotation (), and grasp (g)
 The b coefficients were calculated using linear regression
 248 Decoder weights were then calculated using indirect optimal linear estimation (Fig
 e)
 249 The participant used the decoder trained from observation data to repeat the training task, however the 250 computer constrained the decoded movement velocities to those that were on the ideal path
 Once 251 this task was completed, a new decoder was trained using the data from the second training set
 During 252 task performance, all firing rates were scaled, prior to being decoded, by dividing them by the ratio 253 between the population firing rate during the most recent 300 ms and the population firing rate during 254 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 This method of scaling firing rates prior to decoding was developed to compensate 255 for a correlated increase in firing rate across the recorded population that we observe when the 256 prosthetic hand approaches objects
 This scaling allowed the participant to better stabilize the hand 257 near objects in order to grasp them
 Ultimately, this velocity decoder was then used, without computer 258 assistancethat is the decoders and prosthetic arm control systems were nave to the goalto complete 259 Decoder performance was evaluated using the physical MPL in a sequence task, where the goal was to 261 acquire instructed combinations of hand endpoint position, wrist orientation and grasp posture,
 A 262 total of 3 sets of 10 trials were performed with the robotic limb without computer assistance to establish 263 the baseline decoder performance accuracy in the absence of objects and ICMS
 A trial was considered 264 successful if the participant was able to place the robotic hand within a position target that was 5 cm in 265 diameter, orient the wrist to within  
25 radians and control the grasp aperture to be at least 80% of 266 the way to maximum flexion or extension of the digits being used
 267 Stimulation pulse trains consisted of cathodal phase first, current-controlled, charge-balanced pulses 269 delivered at a rate of 100 pulses per second
 The cathodal phase was 200 s long, the anodal phase was 270 400 s long, and the amplitude of the anodal phase was set to half the amplitude of the cathodal phase
 271 The phases were separated by a 100-s interphase period
 Detailed descriptions of sensory percepts 272 evoked via ICMS of S1 have previously been reported
 Briefly, ICMS elicited percepts that were 273 described by the participant as originating from the bases of the 2nd through 5th digits and up to the distal 274 interphalangeal joint of the index finger
 We selected the electrodes used to provide ICMS-evoked tactile 275 percepts prior to the experiments and focused on electrodes that elicited easily detectable percepts with 276 a clear projected location
 One electrode, with a projected field in the proximal interphalangeal joint of 277 the index finger, was mapped to the output of the torque sensor located at the index finger metacarpal 278 phalangeal joint of the MPL
 Four electrodes with projected fields in either the middle, ring or little finger 279 were mapped to the torque sensor output from the middle finger of the MPL (Fig

 Together, the 280 projected fields from the selected electrodes spanned the index, middle, ring and little fingers

 We also 286 set values for the minimum and maximum torque readings, Tmin and Tmax , respectively, that 287 corresponded to the minimum and maximum stimulation amplitudes
 The selected torque thresholds 288 were 
1 Nm and 
5 Nm, which corresponded approximately to light touch and strong grasp, 289 respectively
 These values were linearly mapped to stimulus amplitudes that ranged from 14 to 64 A 290 in increments of 4 or 6 A (Fig
 d)
 New torque values were sampled every 20 ms and used to update 291 We used two different paradigms to quantify the effects of providing ICMS on the participants ability to 294 complete functionally relevant tasks
 Both the object transfer task and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) 295 have been successfully performed with vision as the only source of feedback,
 Here we directly 296 compared performance with and without ICMS-evoked tactile percepts while vision was always present
 297 For the object transfer task, we asked the participant to reach to and grasp a cylindrical object (16 cm 298 tall and 
3 cm in diameter) with a weighted base placed on the left side of the table, lift the object off 299 of the table, carry it to the target area on the right, and release the object (Fig
 f)
 Two boundaries were 300 marked on the table that defined a 
5 cm region where the object was not allowed to touch the table 301 (red area in Fig
 f)
 If the object touched the table between these boundaries, the task could be 302 continued by moving the object back to the left side of the table and continuing
 Once the object was 303 placed on the right side of the table, an experimenter returned the object to the start position and the 304 participant repeated the process as many times as possible in two minutes (Supplemental Video )
 305 Performance on this task was measured as the number of times the object was successfully moved across 306 the table in two minutes
 This task was always completed prior to the ARAT task

 ;    We also conducted a modified version of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)18,33 , which consisted of 308 moving eight different objects from the left side of a table to a raised platform located on the right side 309 (Fig
 g)
 These objects were selected from the suite of objects that are part of the standard ARAT task33 310 and included four cubes (
5 cm, 5 cm, 
5 cm and 10 cm along each edge), a 
5 cm diameter ball, a 311 rock, and two cylinders (
5 cm and 1 cm in diameter and 16 cm tall)
 Additional objects from the ARAT 312 task were too small to be grasped by the MPL
 The target platform was 34 x 
5 cm and was elevated 313 12 cm off the table surface
 The objects started approximately 70 cm away from the target platform
 A 314 ninth object from the original ARAT task was also included in which a cup filled with small pieces of paper 315 and plastic, as a proxy for water, was placed at the right side of the workspace, and an empty cup was 316 placed 20 cm to the left of it
 The participants task was to empty the water from the cup on the right 317 into the empty cup on the left and replace the originally grasped cup back on the table in an upright 318 position
 This task was considered a success if any water landed in the target cup and if the original 319 In all cases, the participant was instructed to complete the task as quickly as possible
 The participant 321 had a maximum of two minutes per attempt, and three attempts per object
 Each attempt at transferring 322 the objects was considered a trial Trials were timed by experimenters from movement onset to the 323 object being successfully placed on the target platform
 Each trial was scored on a 3-point system in 324 which a score of zero was awarded if the object was never touched, a score of one was awarded if the 325 object was touched but the participant was unable to complete the task, a score of two was awarded if 326 the task was completed in less than two minutes but more than five seconds, and a score of three was 327 awarded if the task was completed in under five seconds
 The best score from the three attempts for 328 each object was added together to create a single score for the test
 Therefore, for the task with nine 329 The score, which is the validated metric of the ARAT task, fails to take into account other aspects of 331 performance, such as the total number of completed attempts per object and the actual completion 332 time
 Therefore, we recorded video of all trials and measured the time spent reaching for, grasping, and 333 transporting the object
 All task phase calculations were done offline, marking individual video frames 334 that spanned each event
 Reaching was defined as the time from movement onset until the first object 335 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Grasping was defined as the period between object contact and successful object liftoff from 336 the table
 The transport phase spanned object liftoff until object release
 337 We tested the two feedback conditions in a block-design over the course of these experiments
 For the 338 first four sessions, ICMS feedback was delivered to five electrodes
 Each experiment day, three blocks of 339 the sequence task, five blocks of the object transfer task, and one ARAT session were completed
 For the 340 next four consecutive sessions, the same testing protocol was followed, but ICMS was not delivered
 341 Statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB (The MathWorks)
 Data that were not normally 343 distributed, as determined using Lilliefors test (a = 
05), are reported as medians and interquartile 344 ranges (IQR) and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to assess significance for differences in the 345 median unless otherwise stated
 The Mann-Whitney U test statistic is reported for all Wilcoxon rank-346 sum tests
 Normally-distributed data, as determined using Lillifors test (a = 
05), are reported as mean 347  standard deviation and a two-tailed Students t-test was used to assess significance for differences in 348 the mean
 Specific statistical tests are noted in the text

 a, The study participant 386 used a bidirectional intracortical BCI to control a robotic prosthesis in real time
 The arm was positioned 387 near the participant to provide clear visual feedback, but physical contact was not possible
 The 388 participant controlled the prosthesis in five dimensions, illustrated by the dark blue arrows (3D 389 translation, wrist rotation and grasp)
 b, Four microelectrode arrays were implanted in the left 390 hemisphere
 Arrays in primary motor cortex (blue) recorded signals which were used to control the 391 modular prosthetic limb
 Arrays in somatosensory cortex (red) delivered stimulation pulses, which 392 artificially activated neurons, resulting in sensory percepts referred to the hand

 Colored grids 394 represent individual electrodes on the two microelectrode array and the locations on the hand where 395 stimulation through each electrode evoked a percept (index finger = purple, middle finger = blue, ring 396 finger = green, little finger = orange)
 Torque sensors in the robot fingers were used to drive selected 397 electrodes in the somatosensory cortex with matching somatotopic fields (e
 g
 index finger torque 398 sensor controlled electrodes evoking percepts in the index finger)
 d, The torque measured at the base 399 of the fingers increased as more force was applied to the objects
 Stimulation current amplitude was 400 modulated by torque using a linear transformation
 e, Threshold crossing events were detected from the 401 multichannel neural recordings in the motor cortex
 Each row represents an individual electrode and 402 each mark represents a threshold crossing event
 Using an optimal linear estimation decoding scheme, 403 endpoint velocity (vx, vy vz) as well as wrist pro/supination velocity (vq) and grasp velocity (vg) were 404 simultaneously and continuous decoded
 f, Overhead view of the object transfer task showing the grasp 405 (gray area), transport (red area) and release (green area) zones
 The cylindrical object was placed in the 406 grasp zone by the experimenter, was grasped using the prosthesis, moved over the transport zone and 407 placed in the release zone
 This process was repeated as many times as possible in two minutes

 a, Amount of time spent in each task zone, per transfer, by feedback 414 condition (n = 20 trials per feedback condition)
 Data for all trials are shown with red lines indicating the 415 mean value and the whiskers indicating one standard deviation
 The amount of time spent in the grasp 416 and release zones decreased significantly with ICMS feedback (*P = 
002 and 
048, t-test, respectively), 417 but the amount of time in the transport zone per transfer was not affected
 b, Distribution of average 418 path lengths in the grasp zone per trial for the two feedback conditions, computed as the total path 419 length divided by the number of transfers
 The longer path lengths (*P = 
0007, t-test) without ICMS 420 suggest that the extra time spent in the grasp zone was to adjust the endpoint position, rather than to 421 hold the robot still while attempting to issue a grasp command
 c, Spatial map of the amount of time 422 spent in each location in the workspace per transfer
 Each individual square represents a 1 x 1 cm region
 423 Without stimulation, there was substantially more time spent near the object in the grasp zone as shown 424 by the increase in the number of locations colored yellow in the grasp zone
 Red lines indicate zone 425 boundaries
 Color indicates the amount of time spent in each location per transfer
