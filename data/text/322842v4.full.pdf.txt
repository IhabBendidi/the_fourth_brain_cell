 The main aim of the RCT was to explore differences in brain activity after ABM training in response to emotional stimuli
  A total of 134 previously depressed individuals were randomized into 14 days of ABM- or a placebo training followed by an fMRI emotion regulation task
 Depression symptoms and subjective ratings of perceived negativity during fMRI was examined between the training groups
 Brain activation was explored within predefined areas (SVC) and across the whole brain
 Activation in areas associated with changes in attentional biases (AB) The ABM group showed reduced activation within the amygdala and within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) when passively viewing negative images compared to the placebo group
 No group differences were found within predefined SVCs associated with with degree of change in AB and with degree of depressive symptoms in ABM versus The findings should be replicated in other samples of depressed patients and in studies using designs that allow analyses of within-group variability from baseline to follow-up

5-10 Attentional biases (AB) and deficits in cognitive control may interfere with emotion regulation and mood state
 Negative cognitive biases in depression are thought to be facilitated by increased Although there is debate about the true effect size of ABM in depression13,14 some studies have reported reduced depressive symptoms after successful modification of AB

 The for appraisal, generation of affective states and emotion regulation
 The amygdala and insular cortex are particularly important within a ventral system linked to the emotional significance of stimuli, and the production of affective states
 The ventral ACC plays a main role in automatic regulation of emotional responses
 A dorsal system includes the dorsal ACC and prefrontal regions and is argued to be involved in effortful regulation of The neural effects of a single session ABM in healthy individuals include lateral dorsal neurocircuitry in emotion perception

 In a study with clinically depressed participants differences in resting state connectivity between ABM and placebo was found within the middle frontal gyrus and dorsal ACC, a neural system important for cognitive control over emotions, along with changes in a network associated with sustained attention to visual information in the placebo group
23 Overall, these early results provide some evidence that ABM modifies function in emotional regulatory systems although the small study sample sizes and variety of approaches used may underpin the absence of  consistent No study has investigated ABM-induced changes in emotion processing using fMRI in a large clinical sample after multiple training sessions
 In this pre-registered clinical trial (NCT02931487) we used a sample of 134 participants previously treated for depression and with various degrees of residual symptoms
 A main aim was to explore the neural effects of ABM within both ventral- and dorsal emotion perception circuitry
  We attempted to actively regulate their emotional response
 Brain activation in response to passive viewing of negative stimuli was explored across the whole brain and within the bilateral amygdala
 Furthermore, we examined how changes in AB, the mechanism by which ABM is believed to work, and changes in symptoms differed between ABM as Participants and Screening procedures: Patients that had been treated for at least one previous episode of MDD were randomized into two treatment conditions with either a positive ABM- or a closely matched active placebo training condition
 Block randomization (1:1) was performed at inclusion to ensure equal numbers of participants and similar characteristics for the two groups
 Participants were invited to be part of the fMRI study immediately after training and preferably within one week after ABM training

 To assess both clinically- and self-rated of symptoms Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-Attentional bias modification procedure: The ABM task was a computerized visual dot-probe procedure developed by Browning and coworkers
15 A fixation cross was initially displayed followed by two images (the stimuli) presented concurrently on the top and bottom of the computer screen
 Following stimulus onset, a probe (one or two dots) immediately appeared on the same location as one of the image stimuli and remained on the screen until the participant responded
 The types of stimuli were pictures of emotional faces of three valences; positive (happy), neutral, or negative (angry and fearful)
 A single session of the task involved 96 trials with equal numbers of the three stimulus pair types
 In addition, equal numbers of trials were randomly presented for 500- or 1000 ms before the probe was displayed
 In each trial of the task, stimuli from two valences were displayed, in one of the following pairing types: positive-neutral, behind positive stimuli in 87 % of the trials (valid trials), as opposed to 13% with probes should implicitly learn to deploy their attention toward positive stimuli, and in this way develop a more positive AB when completing the task

 Analysis of the mechanism of change showed that degree of changes in AB was linearly linked to activity in the insular cortex bilaterally
 Symptom improvement after ABM was linearly associated with activation in the right insular cortex, areas involved in the generation of affective activation within the left inferior frontal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus across groups

  have shown altered activity in areas that distinguished ABM and placebo in the current study including the insula and ACC
40-42 In a study by Horn et al43 increased connectivity between pregenual ACC and insula was found in severely depressed patients compared to mildly depressed patients and healthy controls
 Functional connectivity in the insula connectivity has been linked to maladaptive rumination45 in depression
 Midline brain structures including the pregenual ACC has been linked to self-referential processing,46 hopelessness,47 anhedonia48 and impaired emotion processing49 as well as with in studies of functional connectivity  and depression
 Notably, the ACC and insula are together with the amygdala core areas of the salience network, which determines the significance of external stimuli
 The salience network has been hypothesized to play a role in switching between task positive- and negative networks50,51 and may well play a role in symptom improvement after ABM as found in this study
  The insula and the amygdala are among core brain areas that respond preferentially to negative stimuli in healthy individuals, and activation in the insula and ACC has repeatedly been reported across a range of experiments using emotional tasks with cognitive demand and mental imagery
52,53 Neural responses to negative stimuli within the amygdala, insula and ACC are found to be more pronounced in depressed patients versus healthy controls

 However, neural correlates of early changes in the processing of emotional stimuli might be a marker of a process leading to symptom improvement
 This model is consistent with cognitive theories of depression4,59 which the ABM procedure builds on
 Accordingly, studies on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) shows that pregenual ACC is positively correlated with the degree of symptom improvement
60-65 Moreover, given that that the pregenual ACC is believed to play an found in this study may reflect more adaptive emotion processing after ABM
 Worldwide, there is a pressing demand for evidence-based treatments in mental health
 It has been argued that psychotherapy research does not provide explanations for how or why even the most commonly used interventions produce change
68 In a recent tomorrows science the authors argue that there is an acute need to improve treatment and thus clinical trials should focus not only on efficacy, but also on identification of the addressing such mechanisms by targeting changes in AB, which is believed to be the The current study is based on an RCT with a larger sample of patients that found an ABM effect on clinician-rated symptoms
 It uses a well validated emotion perception task and follows a stringent pre-registered research protocol which represents a strength
 This study exploits the link between a psychological mechanism, clinical measures and underlying brain function measured by fMRI, thus the results should have translational potential The current trial is the largest study that has investigated changes in emotion A key limitation related to the research design is that fMRI assessment after ABM does not allow statistical modeling of within-individual variance from baseline to follow-up
 There is an unexpected difference in symptom degrees at baseline that could be associated with group differences in brain activation
 Adding symptom degree as a covariate in the fMRI analysis will regress out variance related to this particular variable
