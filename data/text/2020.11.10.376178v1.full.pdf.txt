 ;    Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has reached endemic levels and comprises a substantial burden 1 to the patient and the society
 Along with lifestyle factors, a number of genetic loci predisposing to 2 T2DM have been suggested including SORCS1 that encodes a type-1 transmembrane receptor
 3 Here we establish SorCS1 as a high-affinity binding partner for the insulin receptor (IR) that 4 increases insulin affinity, Akt activation, and peripheral glucose uptake
 Mice lacking full-length 5 SorCS1 develop age-dependent insulin resistance characterized by increased plasma glucose and 6 insulin levels and a blunted response to exogenous insulin
 SorCS1 exists in three forms; as a 7 transmembrane monomer and dimer, and as a truncated soluble form (sol-SorCS1) produced in 8 adipose tissue and is present in plasma
 Whereas dimeric SorCS1 engages the proform of the 9 insulin receptor (proIR) during biosynthesis and supports its maturation, the monomeric form 10 stabilizes the mature IR at the plasma membrane
 In its soluble form, SorCS1 positively correlates 11 with body mass index and inversely with plasma glucose in diabetic patients, and in mouse models 12 of insulin resistance, overexpression or exogenous administration of the monomeric soluble 13 receptor domain restores insulin sensitivity
 We conclude that SorCS1 is a critical regulator of 14 peripheral insulin sensitivity operating in both a cell autonomous and endocrine manner, and we 15 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    The mechanisms controlling insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism are fundamental to all 17 vertebrates
 Skeletal muscle is essential to acutely buffer high plasma glucose and reduced insulin 18 sensitivity is affected very early on in the development of type 2 diabetes,
 The downstream signaling 19 pathways of IR in skeletal muscle (e
 g
 Akt and mTOR) are well described, but whether insulin sensitivity 20 may be dynamically regulated at the level of the plasma membrane through interaction with co-receptors 21 or other membrane proteins is unknown-
 The existence of such a molecular thermostat to adapt insulin 22 sensitivity to the metabolic state would transform our conceptual understanding on how key metabolic 23 SorCS1 is a member of the Vps10p-domain family of sorting receptors that also comprises 25 sortilin, SorLA, SorCS2, and SorCS,
 Several studies have identified SORCS1 as a risk locus for type 26 2 diabetes mellitus that is conserved in women8-10, and in female rats11 and mice
 Recently, SorCS1 27 was shown to facilitate the biogenesis of insulin containing secretory granules, but a function outside the 28 b-cells was not studied
 The structurally related receptor sortilin can function in the secretory pathway 29 by assisting hepatic lipoprotein export14-16, while in neurons it physically interacts with tropomyosin 30 receptor kinases (Trks) to enable their surface exposure and signaling capacity
 We hypothesized that 31 SorCS1 likewise may engage a tyrosine kinase receptor to promote its activity
 Given the genetic 32 association with T2DM we here asked whether this tyrosine kinase receptor could be IR
  33  SorCS1 exists in several isoforms comprising an identical extracellular domain encoded by 34 exons 1-24 but with at least four distinct sorting competent cytoplasmic tails (a, b, c, and d)18,19 resulting 35 from alternative splicing from exons 25 to 28 (exon 25 also encodes the transmembrane domain) 36 (Extended Data Fig
 )
 Regardless the isoform, the extracellular domain (sol-SorCS1) can be efficiently 37 liberated from the plasma membrane by ADAM17/TACE mediated cleavage20 but the biological 38 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    relevance of this is unknown
 To investigate the function specifically of the full-length receptor variants 39 we generated a mouse model (Sorcs1D25-28), in which exons 25-28 had been deleted leaving the first 24 40 exons intact to allow production of only sol-SorCS1 (Extended Data Fig
 )
 RT-PCR for Sorcs1 in 41 brain, adipose tissue and muscle extracts confirmed that exons 25-28 had been deleted whereas the 42 Starting from 23 weeks of age, female Sorcs1D25-28 mice fed a normal chow developed 44 hyperglycemia
 This was paralleled by elevated plasma insulin levels (Fig
 a-b)
 The hyperinsulinemia 45 progressively increased as animals aged, reaching 
6-fold higher insulin levels in 50 weeks old 46 compared 10 weeks old mice, and twice the concentration in wildtype controls at 50 weeks
 Consistent 47 with genetic studies in mice, rats and humans8-12, the glycemic phenotype was present only in female 48 Sorcs1D25-28 mice inasmuch plasma glucose in the male transgenics remained normal up till 60 weeks of 49 age (Extended Data Fig
 )
 An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) confirmed that glucose handling 50 was impaired in the females
 Hence, in 14 months old Sorcs1D25-28 mice plasma glucose peaked at 
7 51 mM compared to 
 6 mM for their littermate controls and it returned slower to baseline, corresponding 52 to a 45% increase in the area under the curve (282 vs
 506 mM*min) (Fig
 1 c-d)
  53 The perturbed glucose homeostasis was most pronounced when comparing littermates from 54 heterozygous breeding on a mixed C57BL/6BomTac x 129sv genetic background (Fig
 a-d)
 However, 55 reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity was also evident in 47 weeks old C57BL/6BomTac congenic 56 female mutant mice when subjected to hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp21,22 (Fig
 1e-f and Extended 57 Figs
 a-b)
 At the beginning of the experiment, plasma glucose did not differ between genotypes and 58 neither did peripheral glucose uptake nor hepatic glucose production
 However, when continuously 59 infusing a similar concentration of insulin (Extended Data Fig

 ;    suppressing effect at euglycemic levels in the Sorcs1D25-28 mutants compared to wildtype mice (Fig
 e)
 61 This difference was solely accounted for by reduced peripheral glucose uptake since hepatic glucose 62 production had been fully shutdown (Fig
 1f and Extended Fig
 b)
  63 To assess peripheral glucose uptake, we examined the role of SorCS1 on IR signaling in 64 muscle extracts, in primary differentiated myocytes, and in the myocyte-derived cell line CC
 In 19 65 weeks old normoglycemic female mice administration of an insulin bolus potently stimulated IR 66 phosphorylation (pIRb) in skeletal muscle of both Sorcs1D25-28 mutant animals and their littermate 67 controls
 In marked contrast, at 50 weeks of age, when Sorcs1D25-28 mice were diabetic, pIR was now 68 substantially compromised (Fig
 a)
 A blunted insulin response was also present in primary Sorcs1D25-69 28 myocyte cultures, as more than 10-fold higher insulin concentrations were required to activate IR in 70 the mutant cultures compared to those from wildtype mice (Fig
 b)
 Finally, we studied insulin 71 stimulated AKT signaling in C2C12 cells after CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of Sorcs
 Corroborating the data 72 in the primary myocytes, C2C12 knockout cells were less insulin responsive as the EC50 curve for pAKT 73 was right-shifted approximately five-fold (Fig
 c)
 In the mutant Sorcs1D25-28 myocyte cultures we 74 observed a band with a molecular weight smaller than that of the IRb-chain (Fig
 b)
 Surface 75 biotinylation experiments revealed that this band was restricted to the interior of the cells indicating a 76 degradation product of proIR or IR
 Possibly as a consequence, IRb expression at the plasma membrane 77 was reduced by up to 60% in the Sorcs1D25-28 cultures (Fig
 d)
 Impaired N-glycosylation of proIR 78 prevents two-chain processing and leads to degradation of the pro-receptor
 In the mutant myocytes we 79 observed in addition to mature proIR a species of lower molecular weight (Fig
 e)

 ;    proIR
 Taken together the data argue that intracellular SorCS1 facilitates glycosylation and maturation 82 We next asked whether surface exposed SorCS1 may also control IR activity
 To this end, 84 IR was overexpressed in HEK 293 cells alone or in combination with SorCS1-b, an isoform that is 85 enriched at the plasma membrane and incapable of endocytosis and sorting
 Co-expression with SorCS1 86 increased insulin affinity to IR by approximately five-fold (Fig
 a)
 To assess whether a physical 87 interaction between SorCS1 and IR could be involved we employed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) 88 analysis using the extracellular domains of SorCS1 (sol-SorCS1) and IR
 The SPR analysis showed that 89 sol-SorCS1 binds to immobilized IR with an estimated affinity of 5 nM (Fig
 b)
 Importantly, binding 90 of insulin to IR did not inhibit its interaction with SorCS1, indicating formation of a trimeric complex 91 (Fig
 c)
 No binding was observed for insulin, pro-insulin, glucagon, or glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-92 1) to SorCS1 (Extended Data Fig
 a)
 To demonstrate that SorCS1, IR, and insulin can physically 93 interact at the plasma membrane we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments in HEK293 cells 94 co-transfected with SorCS1 and IR in the absence or presence of insulin (Fig
 d)
 Antibodies against IR 95 co-precipitated SorCS1 and vice versa and this interaction was unaffected by preincubation with 100 nM 96 insulin
 Notably, IP of SorCS1 also co-precipitated proIR, which supports its role in facilitating N-linked 97 SorCS1 exists as a non-covalent dimer and in a monomeric form, the conformational state 99 of which is regulated by the level of glycosylation
 While unglycosylated receptor is a dimer, 100 maturation with N-linked oligosaccharides converts it into a monomer
 We asked whether the 101 stoichiometric state may regulate the preference of SorCS1 for proIR or IR
 To elucidate this, HEK293 102 cells expressing endogenous IR were co-transfected with two SorCS1 constructs where the cytoplasmic 103 tail had been substituted by a FLAG- and Myc-tag, respectively
 The cells were then subjected to 104 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    sequential co-immunoprecipitation, first with anti-FLAG and after elution from the beads subsequently 105 with anti-Myc (Fig
 3e, Extended Data Fig
 b)
 Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG-coated beads 106 precipitates receptor populations that comprise a mixture of monomers (SorCS1-FLAG) and dimers 107 (SorCS1-FLAG/FLAG and SorCS-FLAG/Myc)
 After elution from the beads followed by the second 108 round of IP using anti-Myc antibodies only dimeric SorCS1 will be left (SorCS1-FLAG/Myc) (Fig
 e)
 109 Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitated in addition to the Myc-tagged SorCS1 both proIR and mature IR
 110 However, following the successive co-IP with anti-Myc to select for dimeric SorCS1, only proIR was 111 now co-immunoprecipitated
 We conclude that dimeric SorCS1 is specific for proIR whereas monomeric 112 SorCS1 can bind mature IR
 To explore the spatial distribution of these interactions, we used a 113 bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay
 HEK293-IR cells were transfected with two 114 human SorCS1 constructs each containing one-half of the Venus fluorescent protein
 When SorCS1 115 dimerizes the two Venus fragments unite to elicit a green fluorescent signal that echoes the subcellular 116 distribution of dimeric SorCS
 First, we stained the cells with an antibody that recognizes both 117 monomeric and dimeric SorCS1 and found that only monomeric SorCS1 is present at the plasma 118 membrane as the BiFC-positive signal was restricted to intracellular compartments (Fig
 f)
 We next 119 combined the BiFC signal with proximity ligation assay (PLA) for SorCS1 and IR
 In this assay a red 120 fluorescent signal will appear when the receptors are in close proximity (<30 nm)
 In unpermeabilized 121 cells we observed a strong PLA signal at the plasma membrane that was BiFC-negative, indicating 122 binding of monomeric SorCS1 to mature IR (Fig
 g)
 In contrast, in permeabilized cells a strong PLA 123 signal was present in BiFC-positive intracellular structures compatible with the Golgi-compartment and 124 the endoplasmatic reticulum that is dispersed throughout the cytosol (Fig
 h)
 Because these 125 compartments are enriched in proIR, the combined data suggest that monomeric SorCS1 engages IR at 126 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    the plasma membrane whereas the dimeric and not fully glycosylated receptor binds proIR in the 127 Both humans and mice express SorCS1 in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (Figs
 4a and 129 Extended Data Fig
 c)
 We previously reported that up to 95% of SorCS1 is shed per hour from the 130 plasma membrane by ADAM17/TACE mediated cleavage,
 Given SorCS1 and IR can bind each other 131 through an interaction in their extracellular domains (cf
 Fig
 3b and c), we hypothesized that soluble 132 SorCS1 could have a glycemic regulatory function
 To address this, we studied IR signaling in 133 differentiated myocyte cultures from Sorcs1D25-28 mice after insulin stimulation in the presence of 134 increasing concentrations of exogenous sol-SorCS1 (Fig
 b)
 Sol-SorCS1 augmented insulin induced 135 phosphorylation of IR and Akt and did so in a concentration dependent manner
 No effect was observed 136 in the absence of insulin demonstrating that sol-SorCS1 is not an insulin mimetic
 To establish a function 137 of sol-SorCS1 in vivo, we first compared the plasma concentration in a cohort of T2DM patients with 138 normoglycemic healthy individuals
 In the diabetic group, but not among healthy individuals, plasma 139 glucose inversely correlated with sol-SorCS1 (Fig
 c)
 Since differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes potently 140 liberates sol-SorCS1 (Fig
 4d) and human and murine adipose tissue express SorCS1 (Fig
 4a, Extended 141 data Fig
 5) alongside ADAM17/TACE20, we examined, whether body mass index (BMI) associates 142 with the plasma concentration of sol-SorCS
 We found that BMI positively correlates with measures of 143 sol-SorCS1 both in diabetic individuals and healthy controls (Extended Data Fig
 )
 The data suggested 144 that sol-SorCS1 may act as an adipokine to counteract the increased plasma glucose levels that commonly 145 To establish a glucose lowering and insulin sensitizing effect of sol-SorCS1 in vivo, we 147 injected an adenovirus encoding human sol-SorCS1 (AV-sol-SorCS1) or AV-LacZ (encoding -148 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 One week later, plasma glucose was increased by 55% and insulin by 65% in the 150 LacZ group due to the gradual worsening of the diabetic phenotype (Fig
 e-f)
 Remarkably, in the AV-151 sol-SorCS1 treated mice, plasma glucose remained unchanged and this despite a decrease in plasma 152 insulin
 In an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), AV-sol-SorCS1 mice responded markedly 153 stronger with lower plasma glucose levels at all timepoints corresponding to a reduction in the area under 154 the curve (AUC) by 
5% (Fig
 g-h)
 The treated animals also exhibited superior ability in mobilizing 155 insulin compared to the control group (Fig
 i)
  A similar glucose and insulin reducing effect was 156 obtained in adenovirus treated male mice with dietary induced T2DM (Extended Data Fig
 )
 Next we 157 performed hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp
 AV-sol-SorCS1 mice showed lower basal plasma 158 glucose and increased capacity for glucose uptake compared to AV-LacZ treated animals (Fig
 4j and 159 k)
 Glucose tracer studies revealed that this effect was accounted for by increased insulin sensitivity in 160 peripheral tissues (Fig
 4l, Extended Fig
 )
 Notably, three weeks post injection, glycated hemoglobin 161 (HbA1c) had increased considerably in the AV-LacZ group but it stayed unchanged in the AV-sol-162 SorCS1 group indicating a long-lasting beneficial effect of the soluble receptor in reducing plasma 163 In cells, full-length dimeric SorCS1 binds exclusively to the proIRs whereas monomeric 165 SorCS1 recognizes mature IR (Fig e-h)
 Hence, we speculated that the active form of sol-SorCS1 166 liberated by ADAM17 mediated cleavage is the monomer
 To demonstrate this, we purified monomeric 167 and dimeric sol-SorCS1 from transfected CHO cells and injected db/db mice with each form 168 intraperitoneally 10 hrs and 1 hr prior to glucose tolerance test
 Intriguingly, monomeric sol-SorCS1, but 169 not the dimeric receptor, profoundly improved glucose tolerance (Fig

05) in animals treated with 171 In conclusion, we have demonstrated that full-length SorCS1, expressed in peripheral 173 tissues augments insulin sensitivity by engaging proIR and IR; the dimeric SorCS1 binds intracellular 174 proIR and the monomeric receptor the surface exposed mature IR
 As a soluble protein, monomeric 175 SorCS1 can target tissues remote from where it is being produced (Extended Data Fig
 )
 Given SorCS1 176 is expressed in adipose tissue, that it can be shed from adipocytes, and that its plasma concentration 177 positively correlates with BMI, we propose sol-SorCS1 as a novel adipokine to enhance insulin 178 The study was funded by the Lundbeck Foundation grant no
