 Treatment is costly and current methods to 3 model response can only account for up to 60% of the variance
 The aim of this work was to take a novel 4 genomic approach to growth prediction
 GHD (n=71) and TS patients (n=43) were recruited in a study on the 5 long term response to r-hGH over five years of therapy
 Pharmacogenomic analysis was performed using 1219 6 genetic markers and baseline blood transcriptome
 Random forest was used to determine predictive value of 7 transcriptomic data associated with growth response
 No genetic marker passed the stringency criteria 8 required for predictive value
 However, we demonstrated that transcriptomic data can be used to predict 9 growth with a high accuracy (AUC > 
9) for short and long term therapeutic response in GHD and TS
 Network 10 models identified an identical core set of genes in both GHD and TS at each year of therapy whose expression 11 can be used to classify therapeutic response to r-hGH
 Combining transcriptomic markers with clinical 12 phenotype was shown to significantly reduce predictive error
 We have characterised the utility of baseline 13 transcriptome for the prediction of growth response including the identification of a set of common genes in 14 GHD and TS

 Therapy is not always successful in 30 patients and there are currently no genomic markers for predicting positive or negative responses
 Prediction 31 models up to four years of therapy have been defined using clinical measurements (2) but have been difficult 32 to implement in practise
 Whilst an understanding of the pharmacogenetic background has been established 33 (3, 4), such approaches are of limited predictive value due to the influence of covariates related to the childs 34 developmental stage, disease severity and geographical location (5, )
 The pre-treatment blood 35 transcriptome has been previously shown to relate to first year response to r-hGH therapy (7), however, little 36 is known about the predictive value of this association and its relationship to longer term response to therapy
 37 The transcriptome represents a level of omic data that reflects genetic information, developmental stage in 38 relation to age (8) along with the impact of the local environment (6) and, therefore, has potential to classify 39 Response to r-hGH in the first year of therapy is considered to be a primary marker of growth response
 41 Prediction of first year growth has been shown to be dependent on GHD severity, age, distance to target 42 height, body weight, dose of r-hGH, birth weight and, as defined by regression models, can account for 61% 43 in GHD (9) and 46% in TS (10, 11) of the variation within the data
 Clinical markers such as distance to target 44 height are surrogate genetic variables and this implies that an effective level of genomic prediction is 45 hypothesised to be possible if developmental (8, 12) and environmental covariates (13) of growth response 46 Transcriptomic data have been used extensively in cancer tissues both to sub-type the tumour (14-16) and to 48 predict response to therapies (17, )

 As expected, first year growth response is the largest with a decline in 57 Genetic associations were not robust enough to be used to predict changes in growth rate over the five years 60 The association between SNP carriage and growth response was assessed for 1096 and 792 growth-related 62 candidate genes, in GHD and TS respectively, which passed the filtering criterion

 Tanner stage was added as a further covariate to account for the 82 pubertal status of the patients (Figure )
 There was no difference in auxology at baseline between each group 83 of patients at each year of the study (Table 1B & Supplemental Table S)
 First classification of low and high 84 responding quartile groups of patients was assessed by PLS-DA using unmodified class sizes (Supplemental 85 Table S3A & 3B): clear separation of the quartiles was observed (example of first year GHD response, Figure 86 )
 We also examined classification of growth response using random forest (RF) with oversampling by SMOTE 87 to correct for uneven class size (GHD, Supplemental Table S3A and TS, Supplemental Table SB)
 These data 88 show clear classification of good and poor responders: at each year of the study all PLS-DA area under the 89 curve of the receiver operating characteristics (AUCs) were between 73% and 98% and all RF AUCs were 90 There was limited overlap between GHD and TS whole blood transcriptomic markers related to growth 94 response at each year of the study (Supplemental Table S)
 We therefore generated interactome network 95 models including inferred interactions to assess whether GHD and TS growth response-associated gene 96 expression was related by affecting the function of similar network modules, albeit in different ways

 These observations imply that whilst associated gene 109 expression may be different between GHD and TS, common network elements are being affected in the two 110 The overlap between network models formed a discrete interactome element shared between GHD and TS 112 (Figure )
 When this network was partitioned into genes related to each year of response to r-hGH (coloured 113 Figure 6A), it was determined that the genes associated with year 3 formed a less distinct cluster within the 114 network (Figure B)
 This observation is in alignment with a partition between early (years 1 and 2) and later 115 (years 4 and 5) response to r-hGH as would be expected clinically
  116 The facts that i) genetic associations with growth response map to the network models derived from 117 transcriptomic data and that ii) the network connectivity of the central modules changes over the duration of 118 the study imply that the network models are robust and account for the effect of development on related 119 The Identification of core sets of genes that can classify response to r-hGH in both GHD and TS 122 The overlap between network models was used to select a common set of genes at each year of therapy 123 present in both GHD and TS

 Using the data provided 137 by this previously published study we examined the epigenome at baseline (prior to r-hGH treatment) in 138 relation to growth response (measured by knemometry) in GHD patients (n=6) and found that using a gene 139 level summary of DNA methylation (20618 genes) 497 had methylation associated with growth response to r-140 hGH (rank regression, p<
01) (Figure )
 The majority of associated genes (425/497) were hypermethylated 141 We took the core sets of genes previously identified as classifiers of response to r-hGH in both GHD and TS 143 and mapped gene level methylation present in the six GHD patients with knemometry measurements
 The 144 majority of genes (57/71) were correlated with growth response (|R|>
3) these were evenly distributed 145 between positive (n=27/71) and negative (n=30/71) correlations (year one data shown in Figure B)
 146 Transcriptomic markers combined with phenotype lead to better growth response prediction  148 It is known that the baseline phenotype of GHD and TS patients can be used to predict response to r-hGH (2, 149 -)
 We found that including the blood transcriptome markers increased predictive value at each year by 150 an average of 7% (p=

 The 156 reduction observed amounted to an average halving of the error rate seen when predicting response to r-hGH 157 This study aimed to identify for the first time the genomic associations that classify response to r-hGH therapy 161 from one year up to five years of treatment with r-hGH in children with TS and GHD
  162 Our previous analysis has shown limited utility of genetic associations derived from a candidate set of growth 163 related genes in the prediction of response to r-hGh in GHD and TS after one year of therapy (5, 7, )
 Hence 164 genetic data do not appear to be powerful enough on their own to be used in prediction and clinical 165 The whole blood transcriptomic profile of GHD and TS patients has been shown to be associated with first year 167 growth response to r-hGH (7) and to correlate with the interaction between GHRd3 and GHD severity ()
 We 168 therefore reasoned that there may be value in using transcriptomic data to classify growth response, as it 169 reflects both a childs genetic profile and the complex clinical phenotypes arising from changes in physical 170 development during childhood, as well as variation in the severity of the underlying condition
 By normalising 171 gene expression for phenotype, including pubertal stage, we were able to show that whole blood 172 transcriptomic data, associated with height velocity at each year of the study, could be used to classify both 173 the low and high quartiles of growth response, with Area under the Curve up to 97%, providing the basis for 174 Little overlap between GHD and TS was observed between the gene expression data that was associated with 176 each year of growth response
 We therefore investigated whether GHD and TS were interacting with similar 177 functional units of genes using network models ()
 We generated network models of growth response (as 178 determined by height velocity) at each of the five years of treatment using baseline gene expression
 179 Functional modules of genes within these models were ranked according to their network centrality

 This process highlighted genes previously identified as 185 associated with growth response after one year of therapy (GRB10, SOS1 and INPPL1 in GHD) (7) along with 186 one month change in serum IGF-I associated with r-hGH therapy (CDK4) ()
 It was also noted that three 187 genes were present (INPPL1 and SOS1 in GHD and PTPN1 in TS) out of the four genes identified within the 188 PREDICT validation study as having replicated an association with first year growth response when controlled 189 A significant overlap between the core network gene modules between GHD and TS was identified
 We then 191 used gene expression changes associated with growth response within these network elements to identify 192 genes common to both conditions and show that their expression could be used to classify growth response
  193 The major strength of this study is to have identified predictive markers and common genomic mechanisms 194 related to early and later growth in two different growth disorders
 Our findings are also supported by the 195 demonstration of differential methylation in these shared genes, associated with response to r-hGH in another 196 study ()
 Importantly we have defined sets of gene expression with predictive value in two conditions where 197 the number of genes (1726) is smaller than the number of patients in the group (33-70) [Table S2 & S6]; this 198 indicates that the findings are not a consequence of overfitting ()
  199 In this study we have compared the use of baseline patient auxology to blood transcriptome in predicting 200 response to r-hGH
 Linear models based on baseline patient auxology can account for ~40-60% of the variance 201 observed (9, )
 Using random forest we found no significant difference in the AUC of baseline auxology alone 202 compared to using blood transcriptome alone in either GHD or TS (all ~%)
 It should be noted that this 203 comparison was with the transcriptome shared between GHD and TS and if the full blood transcriptome is 204 used then the average AUC is significantly higher than that derived from baseline auxology (average AUC ~90% 205 compared to ~%)
 We recognise that further work would need to be done to refine a smaller number of 206 genes and therefore minimise the risk of overfitting when using the full blood transcriptome

 First, this study has demonstrated the utility of whole blood transcriptome in the classification 213 of growth response in GHD and TS, derived from a baseline blood sample which is straightforward to obtain 214 in any child
 This technique may be of particular use in conditions with marked variability in response to r-hGH 215 such as the short child born small for gestational age
 Second, network analysis provides a novel approach that 216 can be used to identify genomic features that are likely to have high predictive value
 Finally, a set of common 217 genes in GHD and TS identified by a network approach can be used to classify growth response in both 218 conditions, providing the opportunity to develop a test to inform clinical management

 Classification of low quartile 569 (LoQ) and high quartile (HiQ) of growth response (height velocity, cm/year) over each of five years of therapy 570 with r-hGH (Y1-Y5) was performed in GHD patients and TS patients
 Gene expression associated with growth 571 response was determined using rank regression (p<

 Predictive value of an identical set of blood gene expression markers identified by network analysis 620 in the classification of response to recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH) in patients with growth 621 hormone deficiency (GHD) and Turner syndrome (TS)
 First year growth response is used as an example
 622 Similarities in the interactome models of the response of GHD and TS to r-hGH were identified by overlap at 623 each year of therapy
 Genes were selected that were significantly related to growth response in either or both 624 GHD and TS, generating an identical set of gene probesets used for prediction of both high and low response 625 in both GHD and TS
 BORUTA, an all relevant feature selection wrapper random forest based algorithm, was 626 used to confirm the importance of gene expression probe-sets used for classification of response to r-hGH
 627 The BORUTA algorithm uses a 100-fold permutation to define the noise present in the data; the noise is 628 modelled as shadow variables and used as a basis to assess confidence in the data
 Green = confirmed gene 629 probeset, yellow = tentative gene probeset, red = rejected gene probeset, blue = shadow variables (high, 630 medium and low shadow variables are derived to define the noise within the dataset)
 Low quartile (left 631 column- LoQ) and high quartile (right column- HiQ) are shown for first year growth response to r-hGH in GHD 632 and TS
