 ;    Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal condition with a dismal untreated prognosis and despite the approval of two anti-fibrotic therapies remains a major clinical challenge
 At present there are no available measures for stratifying individuals with IPF to specific therapies nor, importantly, to determine response to therapy
 Furthermore, although forced vital capacity (FVC) is accepted as a measures to change in fibrosis necessitates studies with a minimum duration of 52 weeks []
 Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers for various aspects of disease behaviour in IPF; particularly those that detect individuals at greater risk of progression and which stratify individuals into better defined endotypes (as a path to enabling effective targeting of therapies to individuals most Excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition is central to the pathogenesis of IPF
 The production, deposition and remodelling of collagen, a major component of ECM, is a dynamic process []
 In healthy lung, there is a balance between degradation and synthesis of collagen and other ECM proteins [2], which is disturbed in the lungs of individuals with fibrosis [-]
 During collagen turnover, distinct peptides are generated as by-products of both collagen breakdown and synthesis

 In the current study, we measured synthesis markers of three collagens important in the development of IPF; namely collagen type-1 (P1NP), -3 (PRO-C3) and -6 (PRO-C6) [4, 18, ]

 ;    that fibrogenesis in IPF likely reflects an imbalance between synthesis and degradation of collagen, we also measured paired markers of degradation for the same collagens: type-1 (C1M), -3 (C3M) and -6 (CM)
 For comparison with our prior observations [7], we also measured degradation of the matrix molecule biglycan (BGM) and C reactive protein (CRPM)
 Our data demonstrate that synthesis markers for type-3 (PRO-C3) and-6 (PRO-C6) collagen are elevated in subjects with IPF Collagen type-3, a fibrillar collagen, forms a major component of the lung interstitial extracellular matrix and is synthesised by activated fibroblasts []
 Our findings support earlier studies demonstrating that synthesis of collagen type-3 is increased in IPF, with high levels of type-3 pro-collagen peptide reported in serum [18] and lavage fluid [21, ]
 In the case of collagen type-3, the synthesis neoepitope, PRO-C3, appears to be a better biomarker of progressive disease than the paired degradation biomarker, CM
 Interestingly, in subjects with more stable disease, the ratio of PRO-C3 to C3M is significantly lower; supporting the idea that synthesis, and increased turnover in general, may be reflective of active remodelling and disease Alongside collagen type-3, our data suggests that changes in collagen type-6 are also informative of disease behaviour in IPF and may be an important driver of fibrosis
 Collagen type-6 filaments are an integral component found at the interface between the basement membrane and interstitial matrix of the lung, and act as an important network for attachment of basement membranes, collagen fibres and cells
 Our results support the importance of this collagen in the development of fibrosis

 ;    properties during wound healing and fibrogenesis and may drive poorer outcomes in fibrotic diseases []
 Compared with other collagens, type-6 collagen has been shown to be a potent inducer of the differentiation and activation of fibroblasts to highly synthetic myofibroblasts; a key pathway leading to the production of collagen and ECM proteins []
 In addition, increased levels of serum collagen type-6 markers have been demonstrated to act as an early predictor of fibrosis in the liver []
  This evidence, coupled with data from the current study, suggest that collagen type-6 may in itself be a driver of the fibrotic process, which in turn serves as a Intriguingly, whilst increases in collagen type-1 production are associated with TGF- activation of IPF fibroblasts [25], and have been observed in IPF lung [26], we did not find elevated levels of collagen type 1 synthesis neoeptiopes in the serum of IPF subjects
 However, collagen type-1 is also the predominant collagen found in bone and it has been estimated that 90% of the synthesis of this collagen measurable in serum is bone derived []
 This may explain why there was no difference observed in P1NP, the measured marker of collagen type-1 synthesis, between IPF subjects and health controls and why differences were not seen between stable and progressive disease
 In contrast to P1NP, the serum degradation marker of collagen type-1, C1M, does not measure bone-derived degradation as the epitope is denatured in bone by osteoclast-released cathepsin K []
 This disparity in the pools of collagen type-1 being measured may account for the differences observed Consistent with our previous study, baseline levels of C1M, C3M, C6M and CRPM were elevated in subjects with IPF compared with healthy controls

 ;    from stable disease from as early as one month after recruitment
 In our previous study BGM, C1M, C3M and C6M were also different between individuals with stable and progressive IPF, but these differences only became significant at 6 months
 Interestingly, in the current study, the levels of C1M and C6M were significantly Rising levels over 3 months of matrix synthesis markers were not predictive of mortality
 This is in distinct contrast with changing levels of the degradation markers CRPM, C1M, C3M and C6M; for each of these markers rising levels over 3 months identified subjects with an increased risk of death
 The predictive value of these markers, as shown by the hazard ratios, was consistent with previous results []
 A changing ratio over 3 months of synthesis and degradation markers for type 6 collagen, PRO-C6:C6M, was also predictive of mortality albeit less strongly than C6M alone
 It is possible that the different characteristics of the synthesis and degradation markers may reflect the specific location of individual collagens within the fibrotic lung and their susceptibility to degradation as fibrosis progresses
 Alternatively, as is likely to be the case for P1NP, other anatomical pools of collagen turnover, including bone [27] and liver [15], may dilute the serum signal for individual neoepitopes thus limiting their suitability as markers of IPF severity or disease The absence of reliable and validated short-term measurements that predict disease progression, survival and response to treatment represent a major obstacle in the primary method for monitoring IPF disease progression in both registration clinical trials and clinical practice [28, ]

 ;    remain a gold standard for assessing IPF progression, there are several short-comings of these measurements
 Firstly, they are relatively insensitive to subtle weeks in clinical trials) before disease progression can be reliably determined
 Although a recent study has demonstrated that daily home spirometry is predictive of disease progression within 3 months, there are some potential limitations with this slow decline in FVC making determination of treatment response in individuals almost impossible
 Serum biomarkers, such as those measured in the current study, have the potential to overcome some of these challenges, by providing a minimally invasive, short-term readout that could supplement FVC measurements to give a We have shown that neoepitopes reflecting collagen synthesis and degradation in IPF are informative of prognosis, are able to distinguish progressive from non-progressive disease and provide a 3-month read out of change in disease severity
 The utility of these observations is currently being tested in a randomised placebo control trial of nintedanib in individuals with IPF and preserved lung function (NCT)
 If neo-epitopes can be shown to change with therapy, then these markers may be of use in shortening future clinical trials and for determining A major strength of our study is the prospective longitudinal design, which enabled blood sampling to be standardised and enabled collection of robust outcome data

 ;    such our findings are more translatable to clinical practice than insights derived from clinical trial cohorts
 The main weakness of this current study is that we undertook analysis of synthesis neoepitopes in a single cohort and did not adhere to a discovery-validation design
 However, as this is the only longitudinal study that are aware of, external replication of this study is not currently possible
 We feel that this limitation is offset by our demonstration that degradation neo-epitopes behave in a way entirely consistent with our previous observations, which were performed in discovery, and validation sample sets
 As such we believe that this confirmation of the usefulness of collagen degradation biomarkers provides indirect validation of our findings and supports our conclusions regarding the potential utility of collagen In conclusion, this study demonstrates that collagen type-3 and -6 synthesis biomarkers are elevated in individuals with IPF compared with controls and differ in neoepitopes
 In addition, this study re-confirms the value of a panel of ECM degradation biomarkers that are predictive of disease progression and survival in IPF
 This panel of biomarkers provides informative insights into matrix turnover and prognostic value of change in these biomarkers is discernible within 3 months, providing much needed short-term measurements to assist the identification of at-risk IPF patients, which could be used to supplement physiological assessment to not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
