 ;    Computerized cognitive training programs are becoming increasingly popular and practical for cognitive aging
 Nevertheless, basic questions remain about the benefits of such programs, and about the degree to which participant expectations might influence training and transfer
 Here we examined a commercial cognitive training program (Activate) in a 5-week double-blind, pseudo-randomized placebo-controlled trial Based on a priori power analysis, we recruited 99 healthy older adults 59-91 years of age (M = 
87, SD = 
31; 69 women), assigning them to either the intervention or an active control program (Sudoku and n-back working memory exercises)
 We subdivided both groups into high and low expectation priming conditions, to probe for effects of participants expectations on training and transfer
 We assessed transfer using a battery of standard neuropsychological and psychosocial measures that had been agreed to by the training program developers
 We planned and pre-registered our analyses (on osf
 io)
 The majority (88%) of participants progressed through the training, and most provided positive feedback about it
 Similarly, the majority (80%) of participants believed they were truly training their brains
 Yet, transfer of training was minimal Also minimal were any effects of expectations on training and transfer, although participants who received high expectation priming tended to engage more with their assigned program overall
 Our findings suggest limited benefits of Activate training on cognition and psychosocial wellbeing in healthy older adults, at least under the conditions we certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Subtle decline in several cognitive domains is typical even in healthy aging (Anderson & Craik, 2017; Davidson & Winocur, 2017; Drag & Bieliauskas, 2010; Toepper, )
 To prevent or slow (CCT) represents an attractive alternative to medication and other interventions that may be costly and have serious side effects (National Academies of Sciences, )
 It is therefore unsurprising that older adults are prominent targets of  and subscribers to  commercialized CCT programs (e
 g
, Lumosity, Cognifit, Brain Age; Shah, Weinborn, Verdile, Sohrabi, & Martins, )
  Nevertheless, basic questions remain about CCT
 An obvious one is whether such programs actually work
 When people ask this question, they are usually asking about transfer of training: That is, will training lead to improvement on tasks that were not trained, but that rely on the same underlying cognitive processes as those that underwent training? Answering this question has been difficult due to the poor methodological quality of previous research on CCT
 For example, studies have often suffered from insufficient control conditions  notably, small sample sizes, frequent lack of an active control group, and inadequate consideration of potential placebo effects (W
 R
 Boot, Simons, Stothart, & Stutts, 2013; Green et al, 2019; Motter, Devanand, Doraiswamy, & Sneed, 2016; National Academies of Sciences, 2017; Simons et al, )
 Importantly, cognitive training trials have frequently employed passive (e
 g
, waitlist) controls as a comparison for the training group(s)
 This practice is problematic as it permits only an evaluation of test-retest effects without providing any insight into nonspecific factors related to participating in a program
  Here we report a trial of the commercial CCT program Activate in older adults, in which we addressed many of these limitations, including the largely ignored potential confound of certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 In particular, we aimed to evaluate the real-world practicality of such training by examining transfer effects, beyond expected practice (i
 e
, test-retest) effects (Collie, Although many commercial CCT programs are available (for a partial list and review, see Simons et al, 2016), we selected the Activate web-based program because of its focus on training working memory (WM), sustained and divided attention, inhibition, and visuospatial perception
 Many of these functions decline even in healthy aging (Davidson & Winocur, 2017; Reuter-Lorenz, Festini, & Jantz, 2016; Zanto, Chadick, & Gazzaley, )
 Specifically, the Activate games are divided into four categories, targeting: i) spatial WM; ii) visual pursuit and category sorting; iii) visual pursuit and inhibition; and iv) pattern completion (i
 e
, determining the image that best fits into In our view, the Activate program had two advantages: First, the training is adaptive
 In other words, the program adjusts for individual performance on each task, remaining at a certain level of difficulty as long as participant accuracy and response times continue to improve at a certain rate
 The program only increases level of difficulty once performance has reached a plateau, rather than advancing to the next level after a predetermined number of correct trials
 This approach allows participants to master each task at a given level of difficulty before moving on to subsequent levels
 Researchers have argued that such adaptive training methods are particularly likely to produce transfer of training (Heinzel et al, 2014; Lovden, Backman, Lindenberger, Schaefer, & Schmiedek, 2010; Morrison & Chein, )
 Second, the Activate program had already shown promise of transfer in older adults with depression, with training reported to reduce depressive symptoms and measurably improve cognitive control (as indexed by the Trail-Making and Stroop certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 A recent report further demonstrated the potential of Activate to improve childrens performance on executive function measures in the classroom setting (Kavanaugh, Tuncer, & Wexler, )
 Despite these promising preliminary reports, no other evaluations of this program currently exist (Simons et al, )
 Thus, we sought to replicate these previous reports by including the neuropsychological tasks from those studies (i
 e
, Trail-Making and Stroop tests), and came to a consensus with the Activate developers on Much of the CCT literature has been criticized for having relatively low methodological quality (e
 g
, Motter et al, 2016; Simons et al, )
 Perhaps the most serious problems revolve around insufficient control conditions, including lack of an appropriate active control group to distinguish intervention effects from those of placebo or other non-specific factors, and failure to account for participants expectations of training outcomes (W
 R
 Boot et al, 2013; Foroughi, Monfort, Paczynski, McKnight, & Greenwood, )
 Previous surveys have suggested that older adults have optimistic expectations of CCT (Rabipour, Andringa, Boot, & Davidson, 2017; Rabipour & Davidson, )
 Thus, what appear to be transfer effects following CCT could, instead, merely represent placebo effects
 To our knowledge, expectations have rarely  if ever  been explicitly addressed in CCT trials (for the few existing examples, see W
 R
 Boot et al, 2013; Foroughi et al, )
 A powerful way to accomplish this is with a balanced-placebo design (Rohsenow & Marlatt, 1981), using a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design and sub-dividing both the treatment and placebo control groups such that half of participants in each group are told they are in the treatment condition and the other half told they are in the placebo control group
 Such a design helps one tease apart the true effects of the intervention from those of expectations

 ;    Here we examined a 5-week CCT program in healthy older adults actively seeking preventative cognitive interventions
 Using a balanced-placebo design, we aimed to elucidate the potential influence of such expectations on cognitive performance following participation in CCT
 We took particular care in our study design and data collection to ensure: i) reasonable statistical power; ii) use of a dynamic CCT program adaptive to participant performance; iii) use of an active (rather than less-rigorous passive) control condition (Redick, 2015; Shipstead, Redick, & Engle, 2010), comprised of a computerized program that would believably pass as cognitive training; iv) control of potential expectancy-mediated placebo effects (W
 R
 Boot et al, 2013; Green et al, 2019); v) use of consensus transfer measures that the developers of the CCT program agreed should reflect the cognitive processes being trained by their exercises, and that are standard measures used in both clinical and experimental studies, including in previous evaluations of the Activate program; vi) replication and extension of previous findings on Activate improving executive function in older adults (Morimoto et al, 2014), and of our own work on older adults having higher expectations of CCT (Rabipour & Davidson, 2015); and vii) double-blind design

 This interaction between assigned group (see below) x time (pre vs
 post training)  and, in particular, between time and training program  would provide the strongest evidence of Activate having specific transfer The study was a double blind randomized controlled trial (registered at clinicaltrials

 assigned to one of two expectation priming conditions: i) High expectation priming, in which participants were told they would receive a type of CCT known to improve performance; and ii) Low expectation priming, in which participants were told they would receive a type of CCT with no known benefits
 We then assigned participants to receive one of two programs: the We followed a pseudo-randomization procedure, aiming to balance the age and sex of participants across groups as best as possible
 Importantly, our expectation priming conditions and comparison of two separate CCT programs enabled blinding of participants with respect to their experimental condition
 To avoid divulging the nature of the study and potentially skewing the results, participants who entered the study with a friend or family member, or who were referred to the study by a past participant, were assigned to the same group
 To maintain blinding for researchers, we ensured that those examining participants would not be present during the training sessions and would have no contact with participants outside the pre-and post-training Both CCT programs comprised five 40-minute training session per week, over five weeks
 The 25 sessions each involved two 20-minute periods of training, separated by a brief break (i

 Each week, participants were instructed to complete a minimum of four home sessions in addition to one lab session, carried out in a small group setting at the University of Ottawa main campus (i
 e
, where several participants would complete their training together in the same room, on individual computers)
 The rationale for the weekly lab sessions twofold: First, the supervised lab sessions helped us ensure that participants were adhering to the correct training protocol and were not experiencing any issues related to the program or understanding of the training tasks
 Second, previous research has suggested that older adults benefit from CCT to a greater extent when completing the program, at least in part, in supervised group sessions conducted at a center (Lampit, Hallock, & Valenzuela, 2014; Wadley et al, Dividing the home and lab sessions in this manner permitted us to balance between convenience and quality control
 Similarly, we selected the 5-week time frame to promote practicality and minimize participant attrition, while permitting a reasonable amount of training (i
 e
, 1000min or 17h), comparable to other training studies and plausibly leading to transfer (e
 g
, Kavanaugh et We administered behavioural assessments at baseline and following completion of the CCT program
 We also performed a partial long-term follow-up assessment, wherein we asked participants to complete select questionnaires six months following the completion of the program
 At the time of this long-term follow-up, participants were contacted via telephone to provide final comments on their experience and perspective on the effects of the program via an In order to maximize intrinsic motivation and avoid possible performance decrements associated with receipt of extrinsic rewards (Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Shah, & Jonides, 2014), participants received no monetary or other compensation for participation in the CCT program

 We received ethical approval to conduct this study from the Research Ethics Boards at the University of Ottawa and the Bruyre Research Institute
  Participants rated their expectations of CCT effectiveness using the Expectation Assessment Scale (EAS), a validated questionnaire (Rabipour, Davidson, & Kristjansson, 2018) we have previously used to measure and prime expectations with written messages implying that the intervention is either highly effective or not expected to produce any meaningful change (see Rabipour, Andringa, et al, 2017; Rabipour & Davidson, )
 We administered the EAS on three occasions: i) at baseline; ii) after participants received the expectation priming messages (High or Low); and iii) after completing the 5-week CCT program
 Participants rated their expectations of outcomes on a scale from 1-7 (1 = completely unsuccessful, 2 = fairly unsuccessful, 3 = somewhat unsuccessful, 4 = neutral/I have absolutely no expectations, 5 = somewhat successful, 6 = fairly successful, 7 = completely successful)
 We probed expectations on seven cognitive domains: i) general cognitive function; ii) memory; iii) concentration; iv) distractibility; v) reasoning ability; vi) multitasking ability; and vii) performance in everyday activities

 Specifically, the games are divided into four categories based on targeted cognitive functions: i) spatial WM (two games); ii) visual pursuit and category sorting (one game); iii) visual pursuit and inhibition (two games); and iv) pattern completion (one game)
  The Activate intervention aims to account for individual differences in performance on each task: each task remains at a level of difficulty as long as participant accuracy and response times continue to improve, rather than advance after a predetermined number of correct trials
 The program increases level of difficulty only once performance reaches a plateau
 Originally created to enhance school performance in children with impulse-control impairments, the program has more recently been applied to older adults and appears to reduce depressive symptoms as well as executive dysfunction in patients with geriatric depression (Morimoto et al, 2016; Morimoto et During each session, participants were presented with a choice of three possible games
 The selected game was played for five minutes, after which the program terminated the game and presented participants with a new choice of three games
 Once participants completed four 5-minute game blocks (i
 e
, 20 minutes of training), the program automatically logged participants out
 We asked participants to complete two 20-minute training periods in immediate succession (with the possibility of a brief break in between), at least five different days per week, resulting in five weekly 40-minute sessions in total Although participants were able to select which set of games to play throughout each session, the program limited choice if participants strongly favoured certain games over others, to ensure roughly equivalent amount of training The active control program comprised non-adaptive computer games with no unifying theme

 ;    Participants had a choice of two game types: Sudoku or single n-back WM exercises
 We selected these games based on popular conceptions that they broadly improve cognitive functions (Walter R
  Boot et al, 2016), coupled with little empirical evidence supporting this notion (Shipstead, Redick, & Engle, 2012; Souders et al, )
 Unlike the intervention groups, participants assigned to the active control condition selected games entirely at their own discretion for each session
 We nevertheless encouraged participants to split their sessions evenly between Sudoku puzzles and n-back games
 Similar to the Activate training, participants were automatically logged out of the game portal after 20 minutes of task engagement, and were asked to complete two 20-minute training blocks in immediate succession (again, with possibility of a For the Sudoku puzzles, participants had the option to select easy, medium, hard, or evil levels, as per traditional Sudoku
 While we wanted to ensure adequate engagement with the Sudoku puzzles, we also sought to further reduce the possibility that this control program would enhance cognitive function or benefit participant performance on untrained tasks
 Thus, based on pilot testing, the Sudoku puzzles included in all levels beyond easy were, in reality, randomized to generate an easy-level puzzle on 80% of trials, and a puzzle of the selected level on the remaining 20% of trials
 Moreover, the evil level was, in reality, equivalent to hard (i
 e
, we did not actually include any evil level Sudoku puzzles in our program)
 Notably, because the control program was intended solely as a comparison rather than training activity, we prioritized minimizing difficulty while maintaining engagement
 Our analyses of these data reflect the level of Sudoku participants actually completed, rather than the level they selected
  For the n-back tasks, participants had the option of selecting 2-, 3-, or 4-back tasks
 (Redick & Lindsey, 2013), whereas our goal was to evaluate far transfer effects
 The type of n-back was randomized to comprise: i) a randomly generated string of letters and numbers; ii) a certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Due to technical issues with our database, we were unable to retain data regarding level of n-back for the majority of our participants; we analyzed We included screening measures of global cognition and language function at baseline as potential discriminating variables in our subsequent analyses
 We assessed global cognition using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief cognitive screening tool sensitive to mild declines in cognitive function (Nasreddine et al, )
 Based on advice from our colleagues, we also used the 15-item Boston Naming Test (Lansing, Ivnik, Cullum, & Randolph, 1999) as a screen for language function in our final 53 participants
  As indicators of transfer, we assessed performance on commonly used neuropsychological tests and subjective reports of cognition, quality of life (QOL), and affect
 Here we focus on the neuropsychological tests (for the other data, see supplemental files)

 The digit span task, a subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, is an index of WM capacity
 For the forward digit span (FDS) task, a measure of short-term recall, participants repeat a string of numbers that the examiner reads aloud; in the backward digit span (BDS) task, an index of WM capacity, participants recite the string of numbers in the reverse order
 In the present study, participants completed both the FDS and BDS tasks, but only scores for the BDS were included in our analyses as a measure of executive function (Glisky, Polster, & Trail Making Test (TMT)
 The TMT requires participants to draw a straight line between numbers (Trail A) and alternating numbers and letters (Trail B) in sequential order, as quickly as possible
 The time taken to complete each trail provides a measure of visuospatial capacity, executive control, and cognitive flexibility (Kortte, Horner, & Windham, )
 Here we administered both Trails A and B, but included only Trail B time for our final analyses, as per previous studies of Activate (Morimoto et al, 2016; Morimoto et al, )
 Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) & Animal Naming Test
 The COWAT measures letter fluency (LF) with the generation of words that begin with a given letter within 60 seconds

 The animal-naming test, administered immediately after the COWAT, is a measure of semantic fluency that requires participants to name as many animals as possible in 60 seconds
 Scores represent the total number of admissible words reported and appear sensitive to age-related changes in verbal fluency

 One of the most commonly used measures in cognitive psychol-ogy, the Stroop task (Stroop, 1935) measures attention, processing speed, inhibition, and executive control
 The test proceeds in three timed parts of 45 seconds each: In the first part, which measures reading speed, the participant is given a list of colour words and must read as many words as possible within the allotted time
 In the second part, which measures colour-naming speed, the participant must name the ink color of printed Xs as quickly as possible
 In the final part  the interference condition  the participant must quickly name the color of the ink in which the colour words are written, without reading the words themselves (e
 g
, say blue when seeing the word green written in blue ink)
 The version used in the present study contains 120 words per part; scores in each part of the test are combined to create an interference score
 Because it is brief, requires very little education, and is not culturally biased, this test is a useful screen for neuropsychological deficits
 Older adults appear to have slower interference scores, which may reflect decreased efficiency of inhibitory processing Letter-Number Sequencing
 In a subset of our participants (n=69), we additionally explored performance on letter-number sequencing, a subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale

 All participants improved somewhat on the neuropsychological and psychosocial transfer measures over time, but training on the Activate program yielded no greater improvement on the transfer measures than the control training
 Similarly, the high expectation priming condition led to no greater improvement (on training or As in our previous work (Rabipour, Andringa, et al, 2017; Rabipour & Davidson, 2015), here we found that older adults were largely optimistic about CCT outcomes before they began the study
 Moreover, ratings at the outset of the program suggested that our expectation priming (i
 e
, via the EAS) had successfully raised or lowered participant expectations
 Following completion of the program, however, participants were more uncertain about the effectiveness of the CCT in improving cognitive outcomes, with ratings closer to the neutral score in all experimental Participants assigned to the Activate CCT adhered to the program and improved in three out of four of the games training domains, including visual pursuit & category sorting, visual pursuit & inhibition, and pattern completion
 The relative lack of improvement in the spatial WM exercises may reflect the restricted range of these game levels, which represented list length remembered, rather than a combination of correct responses and speed, as with the other categories

 Interestingly, participants assigned to the Sudoku and n-back exercises reported that they tended to select a larger number of hard Sudoku grids over time, indicating motivation to challenge themselves further

  We examined amount of logged playtime for both the Activate and control games (see Figure 3 and supplemental files) because this was the closest comparison we could make between the two programs
 Note, however, that we cannot be certain that the amount of time recorded for the control games consistently reflected engagement in the task, rather than the game remaining open in a web browser after a participant finished, due to reported glitches with the auto-logout
 This may explain the relatively large variance for several of the control games
 This issue did not Participants assigned to the high expectation priming conditions spent more time on one of the four Activate games, compared to their counterparts who received low expectation priming
 This suggests that participants in the high expectation conditions may have been more motivated to participate in the program, and may have contributed greater effort throughout the training sessions, at least on some games, compared to those in the low expectation conditions
 Nevertheless, lack of significant differences on the training tasks suggests that any possible effects of motivation and effort were minimal, and did not meaningfully contribute to certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Although participants provided positive feedback, we did not find any effect of expectation priming or of the CCT program on our transfer measures of cognitive or psychosocial function We recruited a self-selected sample of relatively high-functioning older adults, some of whom who were concerned about their cognitive health and likely to partake in cognitive training on their own
 In this regard, our sample is representative of CCT subscribers
 Had we recruited more low-functioning older adults or people with psychiatric conditions (e
 g
, as in Morimoto et al, 2016), we might have found transfer of training
 Some promising findings have been reported in people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), although even in that group the literature is inconsistent (e
 g
, Butler et al, )
 One recent high-quality study reported improved memory and strategy use in people with amnesic MCI following eight weekly sessions of group-led cognitive training (Belleville et al, )
 Nevertheless, there is currently no conclusive evidence that cognitive training can prevent or delay the onset of MCI or other forms Although an assessment of strategy use was beyond the scope of this study, it is possible that some participants developed or obtained (e
 g
, from a friend or family member) more effective strategies on how to complete the games
 For example, at post-assessment, a number of participants reported repeating items to be remembered out loud, assigning names to specific repeated stimuli, or placing the cursor in strategic locations in anticipation of a response
 This may have limited the benefits of the cognitive training
 Similarly, because a large portion of the training was completed from home, we were unable to control for environment during home training sessions, or monitor the potential use of external aids (e

, other computing software) to certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Regarding the Activate training, one possibility for the relative lack of an expectation effect is the subtlety of our priming messages
 Although ratings on the EAS appeared to change consistently in the predicted direction in hypothetical and anticipatory scenarios, the messages might be insufficient to alter perceptions when participants have actually undergone an intervention
 We elected not to use a more overt or repeated priming strategy to avoid divulging the nature of our expectations on outcomes is difficult, and the most appropriate approach remains debated (Green et al, 2019); it is therefore possible that using other forms of media (e
 g
, verbal messages or pre-recorded videos) would provide more potent expectation priming
 Despite these potential considerations, a recent study using different expectation priming and assessment methods also found little effect of an expectation manipulation (Tsai et al, )
 One thing to keep in mind in future work is that participants can be quite sophisticated in their ability to recognize or infer the subtleties of experimental design: Many of ours were actively engaged in learning about cognitive aging in their leisure time and participated in research studies as a way to remain informed and involved
 Consequently, many stated at the outset or at follow-up that training effects can be nuanced, and that both achieving and measuring transfer can be difficult
  Although we found no significant expectation or training effects on cognition here, we might have under other conditions
 For example, it is possible that longer periods of training would lead to measurable effects

 ;    Nevertheless, the creators of Activate agreed that our training schedule and timeline were reasonable, reaching the minimal 1000 minutes of training recommended to commercial subscribers to detect performance changes
 Moreover, increasing either of these parameters (i
 e
, length or frequency of training) would also increase the risk of participant dropout
 Offering booster sessions at a pre-determined time interval (e
 g
, several months or a year following completion of the program) might help maintain or even enhance training effects (Rebok et al, )
 Nevertheless, this solution is unlikely to have altered outcomes in the present study given the lack of any immediate benefits
 Moreover, although we conducted a 6-month follow-up, we were unable to analyze these data due to low response rate
 Such low response rates suggest that Our null findings may also have resulted from using sub-optimal transfer measures
 Although we selected our transfer tasks carefully, based on evidence from the literature as well as consensus with the creators of the Activate program  researchers and medical professionals at Yale University  it is possible that the behavioural measures were not refined enough to detect small behavioural effects or changes at the neurological level
 For this reason, we have begun a follow-up trial of the Activate program using identical training and control conditions, but with different behavioural tasks as well as electrophysiological outcome measures
 In addition, as with all subjective measures, it is possible that responses on our self-reports of expectations, subjective memory, and wellbeing were unrepresentative (e
 g
, if participants simply told us what they believed we wanted to hear; i
 e
, demand characteristics)
 However, reported expectation ratings replicated our previous findings, and the subjective questionnaires we administered are Finally, although we conducted an a priori power analysis to determine the minimal required sample size, any effects of this training could be smaller than anticipated and therefore would be certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Increasing the number of participants would enable further exploratory analyses, examining the potential influence of individual factors (e
 g
, differences in baseline performance, mood, subjective perceptions of performance and function, permitted us to evaluate program-specific effects with a larger sub-sample; these effects were The present study is the first to directly examine expectations of CCT outcomes, including neuropsychological and psychosocial transfer measures, in the lab setting
 By priming participants to have either high or low expectations of training at the outset, we sought to tease apart effects of training from those of expectations of CCT in older adults
  Moreover, we incorporated many of the best practices recommended for high quality intervention research
 Crucially, studies rarely account for psychological influences such as expectations of outcomes (Green et al, 2019), a factor we directly evaluated and manipulated experimentally
 Examining such factors is particularly important for clinical populations, where placebo effects are known to affect outcomes (Benedetti, Carlino, & Pollo, 2011) and where participants may have more to lose compared to healthy populations
 Interestingly, evidence suggests that the placebo effect is weaker, and potentially non-existent, in people with certain forms of dementia (e
 g
, Alzheimers; Benedetti et al, )
 Expectancy-related placebo effects may therefore represent less of a confound in cognitive training trials in this population
  Our findings replicate previous reports that older adults have high expectations of CCT outcomes (Rabipour & Davidson, )

 ;    Nevertheless, our 5-week trial of a commercially available CCT program indicated little effect of training program, or of expectations, on cognitive performance or subjective perceptions of cognition and wellbeing
 Our findings may reflect the specific parameters of this study, and do not imply that all CCT programs  even other versions of Activate  are ineffective
 Nevertheless, these results join with others in suggesting caution regarding the effectiveness of such short-term computerized programs on cognitive and behavioural outcomes (e
 g
, Kable et al, 2017; Wentink et al, 2016; for a review, see Simons et al, )
  Given the widespread appeal of CCT as an affordable and accessible form of cognitive enhancement in both healthy and clinical populations, understanding the potential impact of expectations and of program design is imperative to assessing the practical value of such interventions
 Thus, although we found few effects of expectations here, future studies of cognitive intervention should account for participant expectations using a validated tool such as the EAS
 Optimizing intervention design and harnessing the potential positive effects of expectations can also be useful in the home, clinic, or other settings
 Eventually, this understanding may inform the development of more effective approaches towards enhancing cognitive function and optimizing clinical interventions for the treatment or prevention of S

 ;    We included subjective measures in addition to our objective tests to permit a more compre-hensive analysis of potential training-related improvements on untrained tasks and general Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ)
 The MMQ (Troyer and Rich, 2018) is a meta-memory questionnaire that includes scales of contentment or satisfaction (i
 e
, feelings regarding memory performance), ability (i
 e
, self-appraisal of memory capabilities), and strategy (i
 e
, reported frequency of memory strategy use)
 Self-report of memory may be an important predictor of cognitive decline (Reid and Maclullich, )
 Nevertheless, both healthy older adults and those with memory disorders can report inaccurate beliefs about memory and aging  which may reflect negative cultural stereotypes  and poor evaluation of their own memory (Troyer and Rich, )
 Such inaccuracies may lower expectations, reduce effort on everyday Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)
 The PSQI is a brief scale measuring sleep quality
 Studies suggest that sleep quality may deteriorate in healthy older adults, independent of medication use or the presence of other physical or psychological conditions (Buysse et al, 1991; Nebes et al, )
 Poor quality of sleep has been shown to associate with greater risk of Subjective Age Questionnaire

 Studies suggest that older adults feel older after immediately performing memory tests (Hughes et al, 2013), and that perceived age may correlate with cognitive function (Stephan et al, )
 We sought to determine whether this pattern would persist in our sample or, conversely, whether perceived age would decrease after completing the cognitive intervention
 We used a computerized version of the scale, asking participants to indicate their perceived age in each category by dragging the cursor to the appropriate location on a line denoted only by a 0 and 120 on either end
 The relative location of the cursor determined subjective age
  Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-)
 The PHQ-9 is a brief questionnaire that assesses the presence and severity of depression
 PHQ-9 reports correlate with mental and general health, as well as social and physical functioning (Kroenke et al, )
 We included the PHQ-9 in our final 71 participants based on advice from our colleagues, as a more sensitive substitute for the Social Engagement Questionnaire (SEQ)
 The SEQ measures indices of social engagement, including social activity, social network size, and social support (Krueger et al, )
 We included this measure in our final 53 participants based on feedback from our colleagues, and slightly adapted the form under the guidance of Kristin Krueger, who initially developed the Short Form Health Survey (SF-)
 The SF-36 measure of health-related QOL is reliable in older adults (Hayes et al, )
 The questionnaire categorizes the items into nine scales, At the post-training assessment, we asked participants to complete a satisfaction questionnaire for feedback regarding their perceived experience during the intervention
 On a scale from 1-7 (1 = very strongly disagree, 2 = strongly disagree, 3 = disagree, 4 = neutral/neither agree nor disagree, 5 = agree, 6 = strongly agree, 7 = very strongly agree), participants rated the degree to which they found the experience: i) enjoyable; ii) challenging; iii) frustrating; iv) certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Variability in these measures, however, may moderate the effects of cognitive training (e
 g
, people with low ratings of affect or QOL may benefit from CCT to a greater extent; Morimoto et al, )
 Although we did not find large changes in these outcomes, future studies with greater sample sizes may consider analyzing these variables as mediators or participants seemed to enjoy the Sudoku and n-back exercises more than the Activate games, and more participants assigned to those exercises believed the program was genuinely training the brain compared to participants who completed Activate training
 Moreover, we found greater enjoyment and engagement, as well as lower boredom in participants who believed the program had genuinely trained their brain
