  Pancreatic-derived proinsulin is cleaved into two peptides: the active insulin hormone and C-peptide
 Measuring both blood insulin and C-peptide together can estimate the contributions of insulin secretion versus insulin clearance[]
 C-peptide is not subject to the same stringent clearance mechanism of blood insulin, and it is possible to take advantage of this divergence in the mechanisms of hormone clearance to determine the specificity of insulin clearance versus the disappearance of co-secreted C-peptide or general mechanisms of clearance for other peptides
 Insulin clearance is a key regulator of circulating insulin levels[]

 In obese patients assessed for insulin resistance, the magnitude of lower insulin clearance coincided with a progressive increase in levels of blood insulin[]

 Here, we define a role for the intestinal microbiota in regulating insulin clearance during prolonged diet-induced obesity in mice

 HFD-fed mice had higher fasting insulin and a greater increase in blood insulin concentration during the oral glucose challenge (Figure C)
 C-peptide was elevated both in the fasted state and during the oral glucose challenge in HFD-fed mice compared to chow diet-fed mice (Figure D)
 Antibiotic treatment attenuated the increase in blood insulin, but not C-peptide, during the oral glucose challenge (Figure 1C, D)

 Together, these data support a model in which the intestinal microbiota changes during Our data show that antibiotics improve insulin clearance in mice fed HFD for a prolonged period, such as 12 or 37 weeks, but not during short-term HFD feeding (i

 Aging alters the composition of the gut microbiome and promotes inflammation and insulin resistance[]
 To investigate if aging contributes to defects in insulin clearance, we tested insulin clearance in chow-fed mice that were 4, 10, or 21 months of age
 Although body mass increased with age (Figure 3A), insulin clearance was unaltered in aged mice (Figure B)
 Thus, our data support a model where defects in insulin clearance in mice fed a HFD for 12 weeks or longer occurred independently of aging
 These data are concordant with a previous report that demonstrated aging did not alter insulin clearance in 3- and -The microbiota from HFD-fed mice is an independent and transmissible factor that To investigate a causative role for the intestinal microbiota in regulating insulin clearance, we colonized germ-free mice for 6-8 weeks with the microbiota from conventional donor mice fed either a chow or HFD containing 45% of calories from fat (Figure A)

  On day 45 of colonization, germ-free recipient mice were challenged with human insulin (1 U/kg) and tested for insulin clearance (Figure C)
 At this time, all recipient mice were being fed chow diet
 There was no difference in insulin clearance between Chow-R and HFD-R mice (Figure C)
 Surprisingly, there was also no significant difference in the microbial composition between Chow-R and HFD-R mice fed a chow diet, as measured by the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index (Figure D)
 We have previously used this 45-day colonization protocol to cause transmissible differences in the intestinal microbiota and glucose metabolism of germ-free recipient mice colonized with microbes, but donor mice were fed a more obesogenic HFD that contain 60% of calories from fat[]
 In the current experiments used donor mice fed a HFD with 45% of calories derived from fat and the absence of an overt microbial phenotype may explain why there was no difference in insulin clearance
 It was also possible that subtle differences in the microbiota existed between the Chow-R and HFD-R groups, but a dietary stress in the recent mice was required to unmask the phenotype
 To test this hypothesis, we switched all recipient mice from a chow diet to HFD for 2 weeks and repeated the human insulin (1 U/kg) challenge
 Based on the data in Figure 2B, which show that 2 weeks of HFD feeding is insufficient to cause defective insulin clearance, we predicted that this intervention should not alter insulin clearance unless an underlying microbial phenotype was present

 These data suggest that the microbes in HFD-R predisposed mice towards defective insulin clearance, which manifested upon the stress of HFD feeding
 Importantly, this transmissible microbiota effect on insulin clearance was unlikely due to differences in body mass between Chow-R and HFD-R mice, as these groups differed in body mass both on chow diet and HFD (Figure B)
 -diversity analysis confirmed that the microbial populations of Chow-R and HFD-R mice were different after 2 weeks of HFD feeding (Figure F)
 Thus, the stress of HFD feeding revealed differences in the composition of microbiota of Chow-R versus HFD-R mice, which resulted in defective insulin clearance in the HFD-R mice
 We also tested C-peptide clearance in colonized germ-free Chow-R and HFD-R mice after 2 weeks of HFD using a human C-peptide injection (50 g/kg, i

 C-peptide clearance was not altered in HFD-R relative to Chow-R, demonstrating that the microbiota of HFD-fed mice does not alter clearance of a protein co-secreted with insulin (Figure G)
 Our findings show that the microbiota of lean mice is sufficient to protect mice from obesity-induced microbe-transmissible defects in insulin clearance
 Our findings also indicate that microbial and dietary factors synergize to impair To identify microbial taxa that correlate with impaired insulin clearance during diet-induced obesity, we compared the fecal microbiome characteristics in Chow-R and HFD-R mice at day 45 (Figure 4D) and after 2 weeks of HFD feeding (Figure 4F) using a pairwise Wilcoxon test of all taxa (collapsed to the genus level)

 The relative abundances of 32 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed between Chow-R and HFD-R, on either day 45 or Three clusters of taxa can be delineated in the feces of Chow-R and HFD-R mice
 First, a cluster of 7 taxa shows lower relative abundance in HFD-R mice versus Chow-R mice, when both groups of mice were fed chow diet (see Figure 5A  2 black boxes on the heat map)
 These lower abundances persisted when both recipient groups were switched to HFD
 Since HFD-R mice did not display defective insulin clearance when fed chow diet (Figure 4C), these differences are unlikely to account for the changes in insulin clearance
 The second cluster shows a group of 5 taxa whose relative abundances were only increased when HFD-R mice were fed HFD (see Figure 5A  purple box on the heat map)
 These taxa show small to moderate differences between Chow-R and HFD-R fed chow diet, but these taxa were clearly increased in HFD-R mice fed HFD
 The third cluster shows the most dramatic shift in relative abundances related to defective insulin clearance (see Figure 5A  green box on the heat map)
 These 9 taxa were very low or below detectable levels in the Chow-R group, irrespective of diet
 In the HFD-R group, these taxa were low or absent when mice were fed chow diet, but these 9 taxa significantly increased in relative abundance when HFD-R mice were switched to HFD, which is the To understand the phylogenetic relationship between the taxa identified in these clusters, we created a phylogenetic tree of the 16S rRNA genomic sequences for all taxa detected in the recipient germ-free mice (Figure 5B, and enlarged circular dendrogram in Supplemental Figure was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 Most taxa from clusters 2 and 3, highlighted in purple and green, respectively, are closely phylogenetically related
 Four members of cluster 3 are from the Clostridiaceae family and 6 of its 9 members cluster tightly
 One member of cluster 3, from the Enterococcaceae family, shares similarity with two members of cluster 
 Of the 14 taxa highlighted in clusters 2 and 3, only two members, from the Enterobacteriaceae and Coriobacteriaceae family, are located on more distal nodes
 Notably, no bacterial taxa significantly decreased with the emergence of the insulin clearance defect
 Changes in taxa associated with cluster 1 are not good candidates in the search for microbes that could drive defective insulin clearance, as the levels of these taxa were comparable across the HFD-fed Chow-R and HFD-R mice
 However, microbes identified in clusters 2 and 3, which are phylogenetically similar, are potential candidates for driving A consortium of five bacterial taxa predicts changes in insulin clearance  We next performed Pearson correlations of the relative abundance of each taxon from clusters 2 and 3 (see Figure 5A) to the AUC from the insulin clearance test performed in Figure 4E (Supplemental Figure )
 We focused only on the germ-free mice colonized with HFD microbiota (HFD-R) after 2 weeks of HFD feeding because this is the condition that had impaired insulin clearance relative to Chow-R mice
 In this way, a positive correlation indicates that increased relative abundance occurs in concert with decreased (i

 worse) insulin clearance
 Nine out of 14 taxa positively correlated with degree of insulin clearance (Table 1), although only two of the independent correlations were statistically significant

 These correlations suggest that the taxa contained in cluster 3 are the best candidates for driving microbe-induced defects in insulin clearance
 To identify the minimum consortium of microbes that can predict impaired (i
 e
 lower) insulin clearance, we performed a multiple linear regression of the taxa relative abundance versus insulin clearance in HFD-R mice after 2 weeks of HFD feeding
 Input into the model was based on taxa correlation rank from Table 
 Relative abundances of each taxon were added to the model from the highest to the lowest correlate
 Before input into the multiple regression model, we performed a Pearson co-correlation analysis of the relative abundance of the 14 taxa to identify pairs that are colinear (Figure C)
 A strong positive correlation existed between the abundances of 3 members of Clostridiaceae (f) taxa that are ranked 2, 3, and 4 in Table 
 Thus, the relative abundances of these 3 taxa were averaged to create a single input into the multiple linear regression model
 The model that best explained the variance in insulin clearance in the HFD-R, high HFD-fed, mice contained the top 5 taxa from the Pearson correlations: Enterococcaceae (f), 3 members of Clostridiaceae (f), and Peptostreptococcaceae (f) (Table )
 In this case, 92% of the variance in the insulin clearance AUC was explained by these 5 taxa
 Thus, a small consortium of taxa that was selectively increased in the HFD-R mice fed HFD for 2 weeks explains the variance in insulin clearance

 Microbe-induced changes in insulin clearance did not alter the kinetics of C-peptide levels, indicating that the microbiota induced an effect specific to insulin rather than a co-secreted endocrine factor or general effect on peptide Gut microbiome composition and host genetics have been shown to alter insulin secretion
 Consistent with our results, where we found that 3 members of the Clostridiaceae family correlated with changes in insulin clearance, previous work that focused on insulin secretion found that Clostridiaceae showed the highest correlation with insulin levels[]
 It appears that changes in the relative abundance of members of the Clostridiaceae family are positioned to alter insulin dynamics in the host
 We also found that increased Enterococcaceae were part of the small cluster of taxa that corelated with impaired insulin secretion
 This result is consistent changes in Enterococcaceae regulating insulin, since intermittent fasting lowers blood insulin and glucose and improved insulin sensitivity, coincident with a decreased relative abundance of Enterococcaceae in obese, diabetic, db/db mice[]

 Recipient mice colonized with microbes were compared after 6 weeks on chow diet and then after 2 weeks of HFD feeding
 Fold change in the relative abundance of each taxon was calculated relative to the median level across the 28 samples and plotted in the heatmap
 Three clusters of taxa were identified based on differences between Chow-R and HFD-R groups (cluster 1 = 2 black boxes, cluster 2 = purple box, cluster 3 = green box on the heatmap)
 Statistical analysis was performed using pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test
 Correction for multiple hypothesis testing (FDR) was calculated using the Benjamini-B) Phylogenetic tree of the 16S rRNA genomic sequences of all the taxa detected at a minimum of 10 reads in all the recipient germ-free recipient mice
