tDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that delivers constant, low electrical current resultingin changes to cortical excitability and prior work suggests it may enhance motor learning
 We evaluate forthe first time the potential of tDCS, coupled with motor skill training, to accelerate the development oflaparoscopic technical skills
 In this pre-registered, double-blinded and sham-controlled study, 60 healthysubjects were randomized into sham or active tDCS in either bilateral primary motor cortex (bM)or supplementary motor area (SMA) electrode configurations
 All subjects practiced the Fundamentalof Laparoscopic Surgery Peg Transfer Task during a pre-test, six 20-minute training sessions, and apost-test
 The primary outcome was change in laparoscopic skill performance over time, quantified byimprovement in performance according to a seconds-per-object calculated score accounting for errors
Sixty participants were randomized equally into the three training cohorts (active bM1, active SMA,sham)
 The active groups had significantly greater improvement in performance from pre-test to post-testcompared to the sham groups (108 vs 76 seconds, p = 
 )
 Both bM1 and SMA active cohorts hadsignificantly greater improvement in learning (p < 
01), achieving the same skill level in 4 sessionscompared to the 6 sessions required of the sham cohort
 The SMA cohort had more variability inperformance compared to the bM1 and control cohorts
 Laparoscopic skill training with active, bM1 orSMA, tDCS exhibited significantly greater learning relative to training with sham tDCS

 ;    COX et al, TDCS FOR LAPAROSCOPIC SKILLS TRAINING, OCTOBER 2018 The field of surgery has continued to evolve over time with technological advances, work hourrestrictions, and emphasis on patient safety []
 This evolution has driven surgical residenciesto focus on simulation and competency-based training to target technical skill developmentin a safe, controlled environment prior to patient interaction []
 The importance of thistraining paradigm has been exemplified by the American Board of Surgery requiring that allgeneral surgery residents pass the one-time, simulation-based certifications in Fundamentals ofLaparoscopic Surgery (FLS) and Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery (FESTM) [9, ]
 Thedevelopment of these basic technical skills requires the removal of residents from the bedsidein order to achieve repetition of training within the simulation lab []
 Therefore, it isimperative that new technologies and training techniques are developed symbiotically to expeditethe time-consuming development of basic technical skills in the simulation lab
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation techniquethat delivers constant, low electrical current via saline-soaked electrodes on the scalp to modifyneuronal excitability in the underlying cortex []
 Anodal current has been shown to increasecortical excitability and facilitate spontaneous neuronal firing []
 Numerous studies suggest thattDCS to motor cortex, in some cases coupled with simultaneous motor skill training, may enhancemotor learning in healthy individuals [1923] as well as faster motor-system recovery followingstroke in clinical populations [24, ]
 While a recent consensus paper on tDCS and motorlearning described promising results, it also highlighted a pressing need for prospective, pre-registered, hypothesis-based studies to improve the transparency and replication of this approachso that the potential of these interventions may be rigorously established []
 The ease withwhich tDCS can be implemented and tolerated, paired with the potential for lasting changes incortical excitability and associated motor learning, gives this approach the powerful potential toaccelerate the development of surgical technical skills [27, ]
 Additionally, the safety profileof tDCS has been well described with parameters feasible for implementation within a surgicalOnly one prior study has been published on the application of tDCS within surgery []
 In thatstudy, Ciechanski and colleagues applied anodal tDCS to 22 medical students performing a neu-rosurgical tumor resection task resulting in improved efficiency and effectiveness of performance

 The applicationof tDCS within general surgery training, targeting fundamental and generalizable skills necessaryto pass required technical skill assessments, has yet to be investigated
 Additionally, given thattDCS has not previously been applied in a bimanual surgical skill task, the optimal electrodeTherefore, the current study aimed to test the efficacy of tDCS during laparoscopic skilltraining to determine if it has the capacity to accelerate technical skill acquisition
 We electedtDCS parameters to be in the range of those previously reported to affect motor skill training
Since the optimal electrode configuration is not known, we evaluated two separate electrodeconfigurations, each targeting the motor system (bilateral primary motor area and supplementalmotor area)
 We hypothesized active tDCS would lead to faster and larger learning gains relativeto sham tDCS while performing the FLS Peg Transfer Task, and we evaluated the exploratoryhypothesis that the two active placements would differ in their effects
 We selected the SMA targetdue to its functional role in motor planning and execution, as well as bimanual coordination;prior tDCS studies have shown that stimulation of the SMA can increase performance on simpleThis double-blinded, randomized, and sham-controlled study was approved by the DukeHealthy adults with the ability to provide consent and follow directions were included in thestudy

 In the three instances where a pre or post-tests was not completed, the first repetitionStudy data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)Subjects completed a questionnaire consisting of baseline characteristics, prior surgical skillexperience, and personal behaviors which was repeated at the beginning of each visit
 Baselinecharacteristics included age, sex, ethnicity, race, and handedness
 Prior experience with eitheropen or laparoscopic surgery was obtained
 Personal behaviors included self-identification as anathlete, musician, video gamer, or artist in addition to servings of caffeine consumed and hoursVideos of each study visit were recorded using the Argus Science Frame Grabber (ArgusScience, LLC, Tyngsborough, MA)
 This system digitizes the analog signal directly from thecamera located within the FLS box trainer
 Each video was reviewed and scored at a later dateby a single study team member (MLC) with surgical experience to ensure internal consistency
Errors were defined as 1) drops of the object outside the field of view and 2) imprper transfers(transfer on a drop, transfer with the wrong hand, resting the object during transfer)
 These errorswere penalized by deducting either 3 (drop out of field-of-view) or 1 (improper transfer) fromTime-to-completion and errors committed were recorded for both pre- and post-tests
 Dataobtained from each 20-minute training session included number of full repetitions completed,number of individual objects moved, and errors committed
 An overall score was calculated bysubtracting the penalties accrued from errors from the total number of objects moved (Figure )
Finally, seconds-per-object were calculated for the pre-test, six training sessions, and post-testin order to have all longitudinal assessments on the same measurement scale for analysis
Baseline characteristics, personal behaviors, and prior surgical skill data were compiled andanalyzed

 Given the safety and ease of administering tDCSalong with these promising preliminary results, this novel technique could be a useful andAll general surgery residents utilize deliberate practice within the surgical simulation lab inorder to pass the national, standardized FLS curriculum allowing for board eligibility
 However,the amount of time allotted for training is restricted by the maximum 80-hour work week
Our results suggest trainees could achieve faster and greater learning with the application oftDCS during practice sessions
 Subjects training with active tDCS reached the same level oftechnical skill in roughly two thirds the time as compared with sham tDCS
 This translates toabout 40 minutes less total training time when using active tDCS, a savings that could likelybe compounded when factoring in training on all five FLS tasks
 Collectively, the active tDCScohorts improved an average of 31 seconds more per repetition of the Peg Transfer Task comparedto the sham cohort
 This is a highly meaningful amount considering a total completion time of48 seconds is considered expert proficiency in this particular task []
There is only one prior study utilizing tDCS within the field of surgery []
 In that study,Ciechanski and colleagues applied unilateral, anodal tDCS within neurosurgery skills trainingusing a simulated tumor resection model
 They concluded tDCS safely enhanced simulation-based neurosurgical skill acquisition with larger gains appreciated in the lower skill participants
A strength of their study included a retention test at 6 weeks post-training which revealed noskill decay for either training group
 Unfortunately, the tDCS intervention was fairly limited withonly a 24-minute training session consisting of 8 task repetitions
 The current study applyingtDCS within general surgery skill training utilizes a reliable and validated model in the FLSPeg Transfer Task, with substantially more accrued training time
 Our methodology includeda training curriculum designed to prevent an early plateau in performance and allow enoughtraining over time for the development of sufficient learning curves to determine the effect ofour intervention
 These studies together support the rationale to continue evaluation of tDCS asan augmentation to technical skill training within the surgical simulation lab
Other strengths of our study include sham-control, comparison of two electrode configurations,E-field simulation, and use of a device permitting complete double-blinding of subjects andinvestigators to active versus sham conditions

 ;    COX et al, TDCS FOR LAPAROSCOPIC SKILLS TRAINING, OCTOBER 2018 Limitations of this study include the potential that pre-test differences in performance may haveinfluenced the results
 While not statistically significant, the sham groups had better performanceat baseline, which may have contributed to less change in performance due to ceiling effects
 Abaseline difference was not anticipated given the overall sample size of 60 individuals and randomgroup assignments
 Nonetheless, future studies may wish to adopt a stratified randomizationOf note, the learning curve of the SMA cohort had more variability compared to the bMcohort
 This likely contributed to the lack of significant differences when considering learningin the absence of pre-test and post-test performance
 The SMA electrode configuration includescathodal placement over the frontal cortex which could theoretically impair subjects attention orcognitive control []
 This possibility, and the optimal electrode configuration, current strength,duration of stimulation, and timing of stimulation relative to manual-skill training merits furtherThis was a pilot study with no prior investigation to allow for a power calculation to determinesample size
 Therefore, 20 subjects were randomized into each cohort in concordance with priortDCS research studies []
 The current study included both right handed (n = 53) and lefthanded (n = 7) subjects, but the anode and cathode electrodes were placed in the same positionregardless of handedness
 Given the bimanual nature of the task future studies may wish toquantify the lateralized effects of anodal and cathodal stimulation or use unipolar motor systemmontages
 Finally, the current study utilized a single simulation task leaving the generalizabilityof this intervention yet to be determined
 However, tDCS did provide a training advantage, anddexterity utilized in the Peg Transfer Task also applies to other surgical skills including open,Moving forward, future studies will be needed to replicate these findings, and determineif similar benefits can be gained with surgical residents who have already achieved a higherbaseline level of surgical knowledge and skill compared to the studied cohort
 In addition,translation of these findings to a commercially available tDCS device would also allow morefeasible implementation into the surgical skills laboratory, allowing training without researchsupervision
 While outside the scope of the current study, tDCS could be useful to accelerateremediation programs for trainees found to be outliers in regards to their technical skills
