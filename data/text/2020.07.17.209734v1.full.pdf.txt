 ;    Comorbid type 2 diabetes poses a great challenge to the global control of 28 tuberculosis
 Here we assessed the efficacy of metformin (MET); an anti-diabetic 29 drug, in mice infected with a very-low dose of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
 In 30 contrast to diabetic mice, infected non-diabetic mice that received the same 31 therapeutic concentration of MET presented with significantly higher disease burden
 32 This warrants further studies to investigate the disparate efficacy of MET 33 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases with an estimated 41 annual mortality of 
5 million and nearly 
7 billion latently-infected people 42 (Mtb), the causative agent of TB, can be treated with long-term antibiotic therapy, 44 emergence of drug-resistant strains and increasing incidence of comorbid conditions, 45 such as diabetes mellitus (DM), pose a great challenge to TB eradication
addition to the evaluation of new and existing repurposed anti-TB drugs, there has 53 also been an increased interest in non-antimicrobial host-directed therapies (HDTs) 54 which often target host immune responses with the potential to shorten and improve 55 protein kinase (AMPK)-activating anti-diabetic drug found to be associated with 59 intracellular growth of Mtb and improve the efficacy of first-line anti-TB drug; 61 experiment, MET failed to enhance the potency of current anti-TB treatment regimen 63 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

  76 C57BL/6 male mice housed under specific-pathogen free (SPF) conditions were 79 randomly divided into two groups for dietary interventions
 One group was given ad 80 libitium access to an energy dense diet (EDD; 23% fat, 19% protein, 
5% dextrose 81 and 
5% fibre), while the second group received an isometric quantity of standard 82 rodent diet (SD)
 Thirty weeks following diet intervention, mice were assessed for 83 curve (AUC) calculated from glucose tolerance test (GTT) was used to confirm the 85 Mtb H37Rv were cultured in 10% ADC enriched Middlebrook 7H9 broth (BD 89 logarithmic cultures were harvested, washed in sterile PBS and stored in 15% 91 Mice were infected with a very-low aerosol dose (10-20 CFUs) of Mtb H37Rv using a 95 Glas-Col inhalation exposure system in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory

 98 Seven days post aerosol Mtb challenge, treatments were initiated by administering 101 MET and INH (both from Sigma) alone or in combination (MET+INH) to mice in 102 drinking water delivering ~500 mg/kg and ~10 mg/kg, respectively (
25 mg/ml MET 103 in drinking water delivers a dose of approximately 250 mg/kg to micebottles containing drugs were changed every 4-6 days
   105 At designated time points, mice were sacrificed and blood was collected in Z-gel 108 tubes (Sarstedt)
 Coagulated blood was spun and serum samples were filtered using 109 Right lung lobes were homogenized in sampling bags containing 1 ml of sterile PBS/ 114

 ;    Following 30 weeks of diet intervention (Figure 1a), mice fed with EDD presented 149 with a significantly increased body weight  (Figure 1b), elevated fasting blood 150 glucose levels (Figure 1c) and impaired glucose tolerance as reflected by AUC 151 control mice were subjected to downstream experimental procedures
   153 To investigate whether metformin could restrict the growth of Mtb and enhance the 156 efficacy of the first-line anti-TB drug INH, we infected non-diabetic control and T2D 157 mice with a very-low aerosol dose of Mtb H37Rv which closely mimics the human 158 TB

, 160 10 mg/kg INH sterilized Mtb infection in almost all animals (Figure 2b) thus, 161 combination therapy with 500 mg/kg MET did not further enhance the efficacy of INH 162 in our experimental settings (Figure b)
 Both INH and MET+INH treatments were 163 also accompanied by significantly lower lung immunopathology (Figure 2c and S)
 164 Interestingly, MET-treated T2D mice had a significantly lower overall bacterial 165 burden (~
5-log reduction compared to untreated T2D; Figure b)
 Strikingly, in 166 demonstrated a substantially increased lung Mtb burden (Figure 2b) and unchanged 168 This disparate efficacy of MET in non-diabetic and T2D mice resulted in a ~2-log 170 difference in lung Mtb burden

 In addition, Singhal and colleagues reported 179 that MET treatment was also associated with reduced LTBI prevalence and 180 no significant association between LTBI and TB/DM patients taking MET was found 182 has the propensity to improve the overall treatment outcome when used with existing 184 concentration of MET significantly improved the disease outcome in our T2D mice
 186 However, MET did not enhance the sterilizing effect of INH
 These discrepant 187 findings could be due to differences in analysis time points (35 vs 45 days p
 i
) 188 and/or reduced dose of INH (5 vs 10 mg/kg) used previously
lung bacillary loads and lung immunopathology among non-diabetic mice that 190 received the same therapeutic MET dose indicate diminished anti-TB immunity in 191 these mice
