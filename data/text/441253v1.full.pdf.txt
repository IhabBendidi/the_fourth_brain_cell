 ;    Background and Purpose: For stroke rehabilitation, task-specific training in animal models and human rehabilitation trials is considered important to trigger inherent neuroplasticity, promote motor learning, and functional recovery
 Little is known, however, about what constitutes an effective dosage of therapy
 Methods: This is a parallel group, four arm, single blind, phase I, randomized control trial of four dosages of upper extremity therapy delivered in an outpatient setting during the chronic phase after stroke
  Participants were randomized into groups that varied in total dosage of therapy (i
 e
, 0, 15, 30, or 60 hours)
 Seven hundred and four participants were assessed for eligibility, 50 were eligible to enroll, 45 were randomized, 44 participated and 41 completed the study
 Planned primary analyses used linear mixed effects regression to model baseline to post-intervention changes in the Motor Activity Log-Quality of Movement rating (MALQ) and the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) time score as a function of therapy dosage
 A series of hierarchical models were constructed using the MALQ and WMFT
 Results: We observed a significant dose response curve: the greater the dosage of training, the greater the change in MALQ, with the dose by week slope parameter of 
0045 (MAL/hour/week; p = 
0011; 95% CI = [
0019; 
 ])
 Over the 3 weeks of therapy, this corresponds to a gain of 
81 in MALQ for the 60 hour dose
 Conclusions: For mild-to-moderately impaired stroke survivors, the dosage of a patient-centered, task specific motor therapy was shown to systematically influence the gain in quality of arm use in the natural environment, but not functional capacity as measured in the laboratory
 We highlight the importance of recovery outcomes that capture arm use vs

 ;    A controversial issue in stroke rehabilitation is the effect of  rehabilitation dose 
 Clinical trials demonstrate that motor therapy delivered in the subacute to chronic phase can effectively increase spontaneous use and function of the affected limb for patients with mild-to-moderate impairments
2  Little is known, however, about what constitutes an effective dosage of therapy
3,4  Two recent phase II RCTs, the VECTORS trial in the acute setting5, and the Dose-Response trial in the chronic setting,6 showed that an increase in dosage of task practice did not result in an increase in functional capacity
 Given the discrepancy between functional capacity and use,7 and the alignment of arm use with patient preferences,8 it is important to understand the efficacy of rehabilitation dose on arm use in everyday tasks
  With the widespread clinical and research implications, evidence about meaningful outcomes and therapy dosage is particularly needed
9   Two important factors in the design of dose-response studies in rehabilitation are: 1) dosage or number of hours of active therapy provided, and 2) behavioral interventioni
 e
 the task practice protocol
9,10  For this phase I study, we chose four dosages (i
 e
, active control, low, moderate, high), and a patient-centered behavioral intervention that was especially designed to enhance arm The primary aim is to test the dosage of task-specific practice that is needed to achieve meaningful recovery of the arm and hand in chronic stroke survivors
  Here, we report the The data that support the findings reported here are available from the corresponding author on This was a parallel group, four arm, single blind, phase I, RCT of four dosages of arm and hand practice administered in the outpatient setting during the chronic phase after stroke

 Therapy was provided in three weeklong bouts of four consecutive visits each separated by one month (train-wait-train, Figure )
  All participants signed an informed consent that was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Southern California, Health Sciences Participants were screened to ensure they met the inclusion criteria: 1) diagnosis of ischemic or intraparenchymal hemorrhagic stroke without intraventricular extension, 2) stroke onset at least 5 months prior, 3) age 21, 4) UE Fugl-Meyer motor and coordination score (UEFM) 19-60/66, and at least a 1 on finger mass extension/grasp release, 5) preserved cognitive function to provide informed consent, and 6) judged medically stable to participate
 Participants were excluded if: 1) prior neurologic or orthopedic condition that limited arm/hand use prior to stroke, 2) diminished pre-stroke independence (Barthel Index score < 95, 3) severe arm/hand sensory impairment or neglect, 4) major depressive disorder, 5) severe interfering pain, 6) passive range of motion restrictions: shoulder flexion < 90, shoulder abduction < 90, shoulder external rotation < 45, elbow extension > 20 from full extension, forearm supination-pronation > 45 from neutral, wrist extension < neutral, MCP and IP extension > 30 from full extension, 7) enrolled in rehabilitation or drug intervention, 8) lives too far from training site, 9) received injected or oral Seven hundred and four participants were assessed for eligibility; of those, 50 were deemed eligible to enroll, 45 were randomized, and 44 participated in the intervention (See Participants were randomized into one of four groups within four strata by severity and chronicity

 ;    were mild and those with 19-40 moderate
12  Chronicity stratification was based on stroke onset; those 5 months to 
5 years post-stroke were early and those >
5 years were late
  The intervention was based on the Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP), described in detail elsewhere
11,13 In essence, ASAP is a personalized program of task-oriented training, that incorporates elements of skill acquisition, and capacity building (i
 e
, impairment mitigation), provide the context for practice
 ASAP is especially designed to enhance arm use and to foster transfer of meaningful skills from clinic to home/community environment
 Importantly, task practice, favors development of high-quality, skilled movements rather than high volumes of repetitions
 Therapy was delivered by three physical therapists trained and standardized Primary outcome measures included the MALQ rating and WMFT time score
 The MALQ is a valid and reliable patient-reported outcome measure, consisting of a semi-structured interview in which participants recall and rate the quality of movement of the paretic arm for 28 activities of daily living performed outside the laboratory
14 The laboratory-based WMFT time score is a valid and reliable measure of motor performance for 15 hierarchically arranged arm and hand goal-directed tasks
15 Each of these assessments were administered bi-weekly in the month before training (baseline Test 1, 2), and, for each of the three 1-week training bouts, the morning of training day 1 and 3 days following each training bout (Figure )
 Trained and standardized For planned primary analyses, we used linear mixed effects regression (LMEs) to model changes in MALQ and WMFT during treatment as a function of dosage group (0, 15, 30, and 60 hours), similar to Lang and colleagues
6  Compared to repeated-measure ANOVA, LME is the proper choice of statistical method, notably because LMEs allow: 1) flexible modeling of individual trajectories over time, thereby minimizing the effects of measurement noise, 2) model building certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    and comparison that uses time as a continuous variable or a categorical variable, 3) preservation of data from all participants for whom one or more assessment point may be missing, and 4) to capture the high variability in lesion, impairment, spontaneous recovery, and responsiveness to For each of the primary outcomes (MALQ and WMFT), we developed two types of dose response models in which dose was treated either 1) as a continuous variable or 2) as a categorical variable
 Because training was given in three 1-week bouts, each spaced by one month, we studied the effect of training by concatenating the three training bouts (therefore using Tests 3, 4, 6, and 8, see Figure )
 The test of a significant dose response relationship is given by the significance of the fixed effect coefficient of the interaction term, dose x week, in the continuous model
 The coefficients are in units of MALQ and WMFT (log transformed) change per week, per hour for continuous models, and in units of MALQ and WMFT change per week In secondary analyses, we consider three co-variates in model development based on previous research: age, 17,18 chronicity, 19 and concordance
 6  We also tested for effects of baseline for each dependent variable (using the average of MALQ or WMFT from baseline Tests 1 and )
 For nested models, choice of co-variates, random effects, and random-effects covariance structures were based on the Log-likelihood ratio test
 For non-nested models, comparison was based on minimum Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), which provides a measure of quality of fit by minimizing fitting error and penalizing the number of model parameters
 Residuals were examined for normality and the presence of outliers
 Statistical analyses were performed with R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), with the lmer functions of the Finally, to verify our assumption that concatenating the three 1-week training bouts does indeed represent a true dose response relationship, we confirmed that there was no overall change in primary outcomes between bouts
 For this, we used similar models developed to test a certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 For both testing periods, and for both outcomes, the fixed effect parameter of week and dose x week was not significant
 The dynamics of the response, including the train-wait-train intervention, and follow-up period are the focus of a secondary outcome Data from 41 participants who completed the study were included
 Demographic and clinical profiles are presented in Table 
 Generally, there were no baseline group differences in non-study relevant demographic and clinical characteristics, with the exception of MALQ
 Participants were evenly allocated into groups with respect to severity (i

 ;    (lines); note how this simple dose-response model, with only three fixed effect parameters (see Table 2; left column) provides an overall excellent fit to the data
 The continuous dose MALQ model reveals a significant dose response curve (Table 2; left column): the greater the dosage of training, the greater the change in MALQ, with the dose by week (dose_cont:week in Table 2) parameter of 
0045 (MAL/hour/week; p = 
0011; 95% CI = [ 
0019 - 
 ])
 Given the slope, the corresponding mean total MALQ increase for 60 hours was 
27 per week on average, and therefore 
81 in three weeks (Figure )
  In contrast, the effect of week was not significantly different from zero, indicating that there was no testing effect (p = 
 )
 In addition, note that the simple dose regressor was not included as an effect in the final model, indicating that the groups were relatively well balanced for MALQ (despite larger baseline MALQ for the 30-hour group, Table )
 The corresponding dose-response curve over the three weeks of training is shown by the red line in Figure 
  The categorical dose MALQ model (Table 2; right column) shows that the dose response is largely driven by changes in MALQ for the 60-hour group, as the dose_60:week coefficient is significantly different from the 0 dose week parameter (mean  SE: 
31 
079; p = 
 )
 The mean total MALQ increase over 3 weeks for a 60 hour dose compared to the active control corresponds to 
93 (Figure )
 In addition, the dose_15:week coefficient is also significantly different from the 0 dose week parameter (i
 e
 the constant in Table 2; p = 
 )
 Comparison of the continuous dose model to the categorical model in Figure 3 shows that the change in MALQ as a function of dose is approximately linear, with a less-than-linear increase for the 30-hour The final model using the WMFT (log transformed) for both continuous and categorical doses WMFT ~   week : dose + week + dose + (1|sbID), certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    where (1|sbID) is the random intercept
 The continuous dose model reveals no significant dose response curve for the WMFT (Table )
 The dose x week interaction parameter was not significant (p = 
60), showing no differences in the change of WMFT time score between dosages
  The effect of time (week) in the active control group was not significantly different from zero, although approaching significance (-
045, p = 
 )
 Similarly, the categorical model shows that no dose of ASAP improved WMFT compared to the active control group, as In secondary analyses models, we included age, chronicity, concordance, and the corresponding baseline outcome measures
 For neither MALQ nor WMFT models, were age, chronicity, or concordance significant modifiers of either the intercept or dose response-curve (all p > 
 )
  Our primary outcome findings demonstrate that the higher the dosage of ASAP, the greater the change in Motor Activity Log-Quality of Movement over three spaced training bouts, (~4 months) in chronic stroke survivors
 The average magnitude of overall change in MALQ for the 60 hour group (i
 e
, 
81) is clinically meaningful, particularly given the chronicity of this cohort
23  This is the first reported dose-response effect for motor therapy in chronic stroke survivors with mild-to-moderate motor impairment
 However, only one of the two primary outcomes were responsive to dosage
 Dosage modified the participation-level outcome, a measure of arm and hand use, but not the activity-level outcome, a measure of functional The recent phase II RCT sought to determine the dose-response of task specific arm/hand training in people at least 6 months after stroke
6 A large number of practice trials were administered, but the investigators found little evidence that dose/number of repetitions or active therapy time made a difference

 ;    Considerable controversy prevails in the clinical research community as to what constitutes a meaningful outcome measure in the context of human clinical trials in rehabilitation
10,24,25,26  Recent efforts to develop consensus in the field are underway
27  Importantly, for this phase I RCT, we were particularly interested in how distinct aspects of recovery are affected by dosage
 Most task-specific training programs are designed to target a specific construct of importance for recovery
28  In secondary analyses, Lang and colleagues examined participation level outcomes using the SIS-hand29 and COPM30 (performance and satisfaction), but there again, found no effect of therapy dosage
6  Interestingly, 90% of their participants perceived a meaningful change, attributed to therapy; this perception, however did not correspond to an ARAT change score
 By design, ASAP targets skilled (high quality) paretic arm use (participant-chosen use) in the natural environment
11,31  Theoretically, it is through continued use in the natural environment that the associated gains in functional capacity are more likely to emerge, long-term
32,33  From this perspective, it is not surprising here, that the immediate effects of dosage were evidenced by gains in arm and hand use, outside the laboratory
 ASAP emphasizes skilled arm use in the natural environment rather than artificial task demonstration performed as fast as An alternative and complementary explanation for the discrepancy in findings between our two primary outcomes is the possibility that ASAP therapy effectively reduced non-use behavior directly through its collaborative, patient-centered approach, but had only indirect, and perhaps lesser effects on functional capacity
 This idea is consistent with results of the ICARE RCT to Our study has limitations
 While there was a dose response for quality of arm use, the 30-hour group may have benefited somewhat less from the intervention because relative to the three other dosage groups, baseline MALQ was higher
 Further, the 30-hour group was less disabled (though not statistically so) on other baseline metrics (i
 e
, SIS hand, UEFM, and WMFT), perhaps warranting a smaller response to dosage
 Because of the relatively small cohort, we chose to limit number of stratification factors in controlling baseline differences
