 ;    The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, a newly emerged coronavirus first identified in 2019, is the pathogenetic agent od Corona Virus Induced Disease (COVID)
 The virus enters the human cells after binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor in target tissues
 ACE2 expression is induced in response to inflammation
 The colon expression of ACE2 is upregulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), highlighting a potential risk of intestinal inflammation in promoting viral entry in the human body
 Because mechanisms that regulate ACE2 expression in the intestine are poorly understood and there is a need of anti-SARS-CoV2 therapies, we have settled to investigate whether natural flavonoids might regulate the expression of ACE2 in intestinal models of inflammation
 The results of these studies demonstrated that pelargonidin, a natural flavonoid bind and activates the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) in vitro and reverses intestinal inflammation caused by chronic exposure to high fat diet or to the intestinal braking-barrier agent DSS in a AhR-dependent manner
 In these two models, development of colon inflammation associated with upregulation of ACE2 mRNA expression
 Colon levels of ACE2 mRNA were directly correlated with TNF mRNA levels
 In contrast to ACE2 the angiotensin 1-7 receptor MAS was downregulated in the inflamed tissues
 Molecular docking studies suggested that pelargonidin binds a fatty acid binding pocket on the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV2 Spike protein
 In vitro studies demonstrated that pelargonidin significantly reduces the binding of SARS-CoV2 Spike protein to ACE2 and reduces the SARS-CoV2 replication in a concentration-dependent manner
 In summary, we have provided evidence that a natural flavonoid might hold potential in reducing intestinal inflammation and ACE2 induction in the  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 24, 
 ;     The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused identified in the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019 []
 The SARS-CoV2 virus entry into host cells is mediated by interaction between the spike (S) glycoprotein, that assembly into an homotrimeric complex protruding from the viral surface, with two functional subunits: the S1 subunit contains a specific motif, the receptor-binding domain (RBD), that is responsible for binding to ACE2, while the S2 subunit is essential for fusion of the viral and cellular membranes [2] Thus, targeting the interaction of spikes RBD with ACE2 might hold potential for the treatment of Following a similar approach, it has been suggested that modulation of ACE2 expression could also be of interest in reducing SARS-CoV2 entry in target cells [-]
  The expression of ACE2 vary greatly among human tissues
 In the normal lung, ACE2 mRNA is mainly expressed by type I and II alveolar (AT1 and AT2) epithelial cells and endothelial cells [8, ]
 However, it has been shown that the expression of ACE2 in the lung increases in response to inflammation or exposure to interferon IFN- []
 In normal individual, ACE2 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the gastrointestinal system, in particular in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon, although the functional role of this peptidase in intestinal epithelial cells remains portly elucidated []
 Furthermore, similarly to the lung, the intestinal expression of ACE2 is modulated in response to intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel expression of Ace2 is reduced in the ileum of patients with active Crohn disease, an elevated colonic expression of ACE2 mRNA has been reported in ulcerative colitis patients with active inflammation and severe disease [-]

 ;    with reduced morbidity of IBD patients from COVID19, these data establish a relation between the levels of colonic ACE2 expression and beneficial effects exerts by anti-those diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to the general populations []
 Despite these data raise interest on ACE2 as potential target in COVID19 and IBD, the mechanisms involved in ACE2 regulation in the intestine are only partially understood
 Further on, it is unclear whether ACE2 expression could be modulated with dietary factors that might have also utility in reducing inflammation
   The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that Although AhR was originally described as a xenobiotics sensor, it is now well physiological ligands []
 Similarly, to other nuclear receptors, in the absence of a ligand, AhR resides in cytoplasm as a component of a chaperone complex []
 The AhR is widely expressed by cells of innate/adaptive immunity [19] but it is also expressed at high levels by intestinal epithelial cells where it is essential for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier and therefore for regulating the Pelargonidin is a water soluble anthocyanidin that is widely diffuse in nature as glycosylated derivatives and that is responsible for the red/orange colours of berries such as raspberries and strawberries, as well as blueberries and blackberries []
 While, similarly to other anthocyanins, pelargonidin is thought to be beneficial for human health [23-25], controversies exist over the doses needed to reach these effects, along with poor systemic bioavailability and unclear mechanism(s) of action

 In the present study we have investigated the potential of the natural pelargonidin in regulating ACE2 expression in colon in models of intestinal inflammation caused by exposure of wild type and AhR-/- mice to a high caloric intake and intestinal irritants
 The results of these studies show that not only a dietary agent might regulate the expression of the ACE2 in the colon but also inhibit the interaction of SARS-CoV2s spike protein with ACE2, providing a potentially useful clues in the  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 24,

 As shown in Figure 1A, pelargonidin was found effective in we found that pelargonidin transactivated AhR with a relative potency, expressed as Pelargonidin rescues from intestinal inflammation in TNBS-induced colitis in mice and intestinal inflammation in a mouse model of colitis
 We first performed a dose finding experiment by administering pelargonidin at a dose of 1, 5 or 10 mg/kg in a mouse model of TNBS-induced colitis (Figure )
 Clinical data and analysis of the macroscopic and microscopic features of the colon showed for doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg of pelargonidin a dose-dependent effect with the lowest dose exerting only mild beneficial effects
 However, the 10 mg/kg dose, contrary to expectations, showed intermediate effects between the 1 and 5 mg/kg dose
 Because these data suggest that 5 mg/kg of pelargonidin was fully effective in reversing signs of intestinal inflammation we used this dose to further investigate the mechanism of action of pelargonidin on intestinal immunity
 For this purpose, we induced a colon inflammation by administering TNBS to Ahr+/+ and Ahr-/- mice

 In wild-type mice, however, the severity of wasting disease and intestinal inflammation induced by TNBS was reversed by treatment with pelargonidin as measured by lower body weight lost, lower CDAI and by assessing the macroscopic and microscopic feature of the colon (Figure A-C)
 In this mouse model of colitis, we found a much greater upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression than that found in the mouse model of HFD-F (Figure 3E-I); Il-1 was up-regulated 20 times in the colon of TNBS-treated mice in comparison to 2 folds in mice subjected to HFD-F compared to nave mice (Figure G)
 Furthermore, a five fold increase in Tnf- mRNA was detected in the TNBS model in comparison to mice fed a HFD-F (Figure H)
 These changes were consistent with a very robust increase with in Ace2 gene expression (7-fold in comparison to wild type mice)
 Changes in Ace2 expression associated with robust decrease in Mas expression (Figure 3E, F)

 The anti-inflammatory effect exerted by pelargonidin also resulted in a strong reduction of Ace2 mRNA expression
 The correlation analysis between Il-1/Ace2 and Tnf-/Ace2 confirmed that there was a statistical correlation between the expression of the two pro-inflammatory cytokines and Ace2 (Il-1/Ace2 P value =

 Il-6 up-regulation was much higher in Ahr-/- macrophages compared to polarization but only in wild-type macrophages, while it had no effect on Ahr-/- macrophages, underlining the role of the AHR receptor in the mechanism of action  Taking into consideration obesity pandemia and that exposure to high caloric intake promotes a state of intestinal sub-inflammation, and that obesity is a well-defined risk factor for development of severe COVID19, we have first tested the effects of pelargonidin in a mouse model of a high-fat/high-sugar diet [-]
 In this model, Ahr+/+ and Ahr-/- mice were treated with exposed a chronic high caloric [26] intake by feeding them a diet enriched cholesterol and fructose (HFD-F) for 8 weeks
 Starting from the second week (day 8) an experimental group of mice for each genotype was treated with pelargonidin daily
 As shown in Figure 5, mice exposed to chronic high caloric intake gained significantly more body weight than mice feed a normal chow diet, and they had significantly higher BMI at the end of the study mice with 5 mg/kg/day pelargonidin for 7 weeks protected against body weight gain and resulted in a lower BMI in comparison to mice feed an HFD-F alone (Figure A-abrogated in Ahr-/- mice (Figure A-C)
 We have therefore focused our attention on intestinal inflammation
 The histological analysis of the colon showed no major robust increase of intestinal permeability in the mice exposed to HFD-F (Figure 5D,  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 24,

 Treating mice with pelargonidin restored the normal colon permeability in wild-type mice, but had no beneficial effects in Ahr-/- mice which exhibited much more severe changes in permeability than in Ahr+/+ mice (Figure 5D, E)
  Elevated colonic ACE2 levels have been detected in the colon of IBD patients and are between Ace2 expression and colon inflammation in IBD patients []
 We have therefore investigated the expression of Ace2 and Mas in the colon and compared them with colon profiles of various cytokines (Figure F-J)

 expression of both Il-1 and Tnf-, but only in Ahr+/+ mice
 In wild-type mice exposure to the anthocyanin also reduced the expression of Ace2, bringing it back to the value measured in untreated wild-type mice, while exerted only a slight effect on the expression of Mas mRNA (Figure F-J)
 To investigate whether there was also in this mouse models with a mild inflammation in the colon, a direct correlation between analyses between Il-1 and Ace2 and between Tnf- and Ace
 As shown in Figure 5K and L, the colon levels of the two cytokines were positively correlated with Ace2 expression in both Ahr+/+ and Ahr-/- mice

 Administration of pelargonidin reversed this pattern in a  Since ACE2 represents the host receptor used by the SARS-Cov2 virus to invade cells, and reducing the expression of ACE2 might represent an interesting host defense mechanism against virus invasion
 In this context we also investigated whether pelargonidin was able to reduce the binding of the viral Spike protein on pelargonidin to bind several pockets suggested in previous studies: i) the hydrophobic pockets on the -sheet core of the RBD [42], ii) the fatty acid (FA) pocket identified by Toelzer et al [33, ]
 and finally, iii) the flavonoids binding pocket suggested by Allam et al []
 All docking calculations were performed using Glide software package
 The scores of the best poses highlighted a marked preference of the results obtained in the FA pocket (best docking score -
7 kcal/mol), with respect to the results obtained in the hydrophobic pockets on the -sheet core of the RBD (best docking score -
2 kcal/mol) or in the pocket proposed by Allam (best docking score -

 Studies of IBD patients have shown that a direct correlation exists between the severity of colon inflammation and the expression of ACE2 [12, 13, ]
  These data are consistent with previous findings [10, 46] demonstrating that ACE2 gene expression is increased in human bronchial epithelial cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 as a response to inflammatory cytokine stimulation including interferon IFN-
 In the colon of patients with active IBD several pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-, TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 are up-regulated []
 In line with these data, we wanted Ace2 expression in the colon in a mouse models of IBD and mouse model of high caloric intake
 Obesity is a clinical condition with a high prevalence in the most industrialized countries and it is now known that it involves a state of sub-inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract [48, 49] and it is a well-defined risk factor  ACE2 represents the host receptor used by the SARS-Cov2 virus to invade cells
 Two recent studies [50, 51] have shown that the virus might infect the human gut, and therefore the modulation of Ace2 expression in the gastrointestinal tract represents an interesting research area
 The data we have obtained in the two mouse models of intestinal inflammation strongly support the notion that upregulation of ACE2 in colon is due to the induction of state of inflammation characterized by contrast to ACE2 the expression of the Ang 1-7 receptor Mas, was markedly downregulated in these models (Figure 3 and )
 In the TNBS model the levels of colon cytokine were increased by 5-20 folds and the expression of ACE2 mRNA was induced by 7-fold in comparison to naive mice (Figure E)
 The state of mild inflammation present in the colon of mice fed with HFD-F induces an increase in the expression of Il-1 and Tnf- by 2 times, while the expression of Tgf- was markedly  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 24, 
 ;    reduced (Figure H-J)
 Moreover, in the colon of animals subjected to a high-calorie diet, the expression of ACE2 doubled while that of MAS was halved when compared to that in mice fed a chow-diet (Figure 5F, G)
 These data establish a direct correlation  In both mouse models we have found that values of R squared indicated a close correlation between the expression of Ace2 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine Tnf-
 These data are in agreement with the reducing effect on ACE2 expression in the colon of IBD patients exerted by therapy with anti- TNF- [12, ]
 Confirmation of the direct regulation of ACE2 expression exerted by TNF- was given by the in vitro experiment on human intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco-)
 Indeed, the data obtained by us showed that the exposure of intestinal epithelial cells to TNF- is able red plant foods, including berries, grapes or cabbage, have been used in the traditional medicine in the treatment of a number of human alignments [53, ]
 Pelargonidin display a several biological activities, the most prominent being those related to their anti-oxidant effects
 We have confirmed in this study that pelargonidin exerts anti-inflammatory effects in intestines in mouse models of IBD and obesity through the interaction with the AhR
 Treatment with pelargonidin reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the colon in both models of intestinal inflammation, alleviating the disease (Figure 2, 3 and )
 Furthermore, treatment with pelargonidin restored ACE2 expression to the level measured in the colon of naive mice (Figure 3E and Figure F)
 The beneficial effects exerted by the compound were abrogated in the absence of AhR confirming the functional relevance of the receptor in mediating the anti-inflammatory activities of this flavonoid (Figure 4, )
 In vitro studies also confirmed that pelargonidin might directly inhibit ACE2 induction caused by exposure of human intestinal epithelial cell line to  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 24, 
 ;     The regulatory effects of pelargonidin on the intestinal ACE2 might be of relevance in the context of SARS-CoV2 infection, since high levels of ACE2 are compatible with an increased risk of SARS-CoV2 uptake by the inflamed colon []
 Importantly, in addition to ACE2 regulation, we have shown that beneficial effects of Indeed, we found that pelargonidin not only reduces the interaction between ACE2 and the Spike protein of the SARS-Cov-2 but also reduces the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 to infect Vero E6 cell line, a monkey kidney epithelial cell line used to molecular mechanisms involved in preventing the binding of SARS-CoV2 virus to its receptor identifying the fatty acid binding pocket in the RBD as the putative binding  In summary (Figure 8) we shown that the natural flavonoid, pelargonidin, reverses ACE2 induction in rodent models of inflammation and this effect is interaction affecting the virus uptake and replication

 Pelargonidin down-regulates Ace2 expression and inhibits binding of the SARS-Cov-2 virus on the host cell ACE2 receptor
 Inflammatory stimuli lead to the release of TNF- which binds to its receptor present on epithelial cells
 The activation of TNF- receptor induces an increase in IkB phosphorylation by IKK, which is then degraded releasing the p50/RelA dimer that migrates to the nucleus where activates the transcription of several genes including Il-6 and Ace
 Pelargonidin exerts a protective effect with an Ahr-dependent and an Ahr-independent mechanism
 The compound activates the Ahr receptor which blocks NF-kB translocation into the nucleus by sequestering the RelA subunit and thereby inhibiting the expression of Ace
 Pelargonidin also directly inhibits the binding of the SARS-Cov-2 virus to the ACE2 receptor
 This double action, together with the anti-inflammatory activity, inhibits the entry of the virus into cells
