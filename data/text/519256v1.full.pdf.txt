 ;    Background: Poor efficacy and effectiveness of the pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) component in intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) has been demonstrated in several studies
 The reasons for this are unclear, but may be due to impaired replicative fitness of pH1N1 Methods: In an open-label, prospective, observational, phase 4 study, we evaluated the impact of updating the pH1N1 component in the Russian-backbone trivalent LAIV from Cal09 in -17 (n=118) to an A/Michigan/45/2015-like strain (A/17/New York/15/5364, NY15) in 2017-18 (n=126), on shedding and immunogenicity in Gambian children aged 2-4 years old
 The study Findings: Cal09 showed impaired nasopharyngeal shedding compared to H3N2 and influenza B, along with sub-optimal serum antibody and T-cell responses
 Following the switch to NY15, a significant increase in pH1N1 shedding was seen, along with improvements in seroconversion and influenza-specific CD4+ T-cell responses
 Viral kinetics in vitro mirrored these findings, with NY15 showing greater replicative ability than Cal09 in human nasal epithelial cells

 ;    Interpretation: Our results suggest that the pH1N1 component switch in LAIV may have overcome problems in prior formulations
 LAIV effectiveness against pH1N1 should therefore improve in upcoming influenza seasons
 Our data also highlight the importance of evaluating replicative fitness, in addition to antigenicity, when selecting annual LAIV components and There are concerns regarding the protection against pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza from live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)
 Reduced effectiveness against pH1N1 of LAIV compared to inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in the United States (US) (Ann Arbor-backbone LAIV; Medimmune) since 2013-14 resulted in the Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices removing their recommendation for LAIV use in

2 In these studies, both formulations contained haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from pH1N1 A/California/07/2009-like (Cal09) viruses
 Why protection conferred by the pH1N1 component in LAIV has been suboptimal is unclear
 Potential reasons include pre-existing immunity, poor viral replicative fitness or competition from other co-formulated strains, all limiting pH1N1 take and The findings in Senegal are particularly pertinent as the burden of influenza in Africa is high, with influenza-related hospitalisations in children <5 years approximately three-fold higher than in Europe

 While an inverse relationship was evident for H3N2 and B/Vic between baseline HAI titre and shedding, this was not evident Cal09, where low shedding is predicted even in seronegative children
 In contrast, NY15 shedding was inversely related to the magnitude of the baseline HAI titre
 Logistic regression also showed no associations between shedding and pre-vaccination T-cell response or HA-specific mucosal IgA for Cal09 (table S)
 Similarly, no significant association between T-cell response or IgA and shedding was observed for H3N2 or B/Vic, after adjusting for baseline HAI titre (table S)
 A lower nasopharyngeal viral load was seen at D2 and D7 for all three strains in baseline seropositive compared to seronegative children given the 2017-18 formulation (figure 3E), further emphasising the In seronegative children, shedding at D2 was seen in

 Although the magnitude of CD8+ responses was generally higher, LAIV-induced responses were predominantly CD4+ (figures 4C, 4D, S6, S)

1) The impact of shedding on immunogenicity was explored using H3N2 data, as the largest sample size immunised with the same antigen and with T-cell data available
 Seroconversion and T-cell responses were highest in children with shedding at both D2 and D7 (figures 5A and B)
 Multivariable logistic regression showed a significant impact of this prolonged shedding on the odds of seroconversion (figure 5D, table S9) and CD4+ T-cell response (figure 5E, table S)
  No such relationship was seen with IgA responses (figures 5C and 5F, Table S)
 Baseline HAI titre and induction of an H3 HA-specific CD4+IL-2+ response also increased the odds of seroconversion
 Similar findings were observed in B/Vic and NY15 pH1N1 datasets, albeit with We demonstrate limited shedding,  in vitro Cal09 replication, and low immunogenicity following the 2016-17 LAIV in Gambian children, providing an explanation for the lack of efficacy observed in the RCT from neighbouring Senegal2 Following the switch to NY15, a significant increase in replication was observed, along with improved serum humoral and cellular immunogenicity
 No competitive inhibitory impact of enhanced pH1N1 replication was seen on H3N2 or B/Vic replication or immunogenicity
 Our data also demonstrate that shedding for a longer duration is important for immunogenicity and that viral replicative fitness should be considered alongside antigenicity when selecting vaccine strains
 These data represent the first reported LAIV immunogenicity data from African children to date
 They make a case for further studies of LAIV efficacy in Africa, but are also of relevance to the use of LAIV in other settings

 ;    A recent study of Ann-Arbor LAIV showed improved shedding and HAI seroconversion with an updated A/Slovenia/2015 pH1N1 strain
20 Parallel findings in two distinct paediatric cohorts, using two different LAIVs, provide strong support for Cal09 replicative fitness being culpable for recent problems
 Our finding that limited Cal09 shedding is unlikely to be due to pre-existing immunity further supports this and argues against the notion that reduced LAIV effectiveness in the US may have been due to repeated vaccination in previous years
21 In an earlier study using the Ann-Arbor LAIV, pre-pandemic seasonal H1N1 shedding was found to be higher than for H3N2 or influenza B
22 Why pH1N1 Cal09 replication is impaired is uncertain
 HA or NA residues must be responsible, as the remaining six viral gene segments in LAIV are consistent between Cal09, NY15 and H3N2 strains
 Differences in Cal09 HA thermostability, sialic acid receptor binding and pH sensitivity are potential explanations for the lower replication observed
1 These phenotypes are important for optimal replication in the human URT
 In particular, URT pH in children may be lower than for adults23 and have a deleterious impact on replication of viruses with labile HA
 The pH1N1 virus first crossed into humans in 2009 and has subsequently circulated as a human seasonal virus
 During this time, changes in HA stability and receptor binding properties may have adapted the virus to replicate better in the human URT
24 Thus, the more recent HA from A/Michigan/45/2015-like viruses of 2015 could have We were able to mirror our findings in a primary hNEC model
 These cells display a mildy acidic apical surface environment akin to that seen in the human URT
 This strategy may represent a practical method for evaluating vaccine virus replication prior to strain choice
 As cell lines traditionally used to culture influenza viruses (e
 g
 MDCK) may not truly reflect replication in the URT, these subtleties were previously under-appreciated

 While seroresponse (the traditional correlate of protection post-IIV) is modest, LAIV also induces mucosal IgA and T-cell responses
 In our cohort, T-cell responses were elicited in a larger percentage of children than mucosal or serum antibodies, highlighting the importance of assessing cellular immunity in LAIV studies
 Using the 2017-18 formulation, a CD4+ IFN-g+ and/or IL-2+ T-cell response was seen in 55% - 68% of children to the influenza antigens tested, with approximately 80% showing a response to HA and/or MNP (figure S)
 LAIV has been shown to provide protection in the absence of humoral immunity26 and T-cell-mediated Unlike serum antibody and T-cell responses, we did not see a significant increase in mucosal IgA response with NY
 This is in keeping with findings after one dose of the updated Ann-Arbor LAIV, although a better response was seen after two doses

 We were also unable to confirm viral shedding with an LAIV-specific RT-PCR in all participants due to lower sensitivity compared with the HA-specific RT-PCR
 However, by conducting the study outside of peak influenza season and baseline screening for influenza by RT-PCR, it is unlikely that our results were affected by wild-type influenza infections
 Our shedding data at D2 are also similar to those reported from Senegal using with RT-PCR and not culture, we are unable to confirm to what degree shedding reflected viable viruses
 Finally, an important unanswered question from our study is whether NY15 and related pH1N1 strains will result in improved LAIV effectiveness
 Data from the 2017-18 UK season estimates the vaccine effectiveness (Ann-Arbor LAIV) to be

 Overview of participants who received the 2016-17 northern hemisphere (NH) Russian-backbone LAIV formulation (A) and 2017-18 NH formulation (B)
 All visits were within protocol-defined windows: +1 day for day 2 (D2) visit, +7 days for day 7 (D7) visits  and +7 days for day 21 (D21) visits
 In the 2016-17 cohort, all (118/118) D2 visits were 2 days post-LAIV, 115/118 of D7 visits were 7 days post-LAIV (3 were 8, 12 and 14 days post-LAIV) and 112/118 of D21 visits were 21 days post-LAIV (5 were 22 days post-LAIV and 1 was 25 days post-LAIV)
