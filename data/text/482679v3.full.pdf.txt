 Inclusion criteria were: age of 65-75 years, Mini-Mental State Examination score >25, absence of serious medical conditions
 Eligible subjects were randomly allocated to either receive 100/25mg L-dopa/benserazide (n=32) or placebo (n=31) prior to each of twenty cognitive training sessions administered during a four-week period
 Participants and staff were blinded to group assignment

 Significance
 The results put constraints on the hypothesis of a key role of the deteriorated dopaminergic system in age-related decline of learning abilities, and speak against early pharmacological interventions in older healthy adults to improve cognitive functions by targeting the dopaminergic system
  Our findings also raise concerns about usefulness of novel L-dopa-and present an urgent need to carefully investigate the cognitive outcomes of early pro-certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    dopaminergic interventions in clinical populations often receiving substantially larger doses of Age-related cognitive decline and dementia are serious public health problems with devastating impact on the quality of life of individuals, their caregivers, but also on healthcare in general The current total worldwide cost of dementia is about a trillion US dollars a year and is expected to double by 2030 ()
 Whilst pharmacological treatment approaches have been unsuccessful, recent studies have demonstrated that combining cognitive training with exercise and a healthy diet can affect cognitive functioning in at-risk older people ()
 Both exercise and dietary nutrients have been put forward as enhancers of neurobiological plasticity (3, 4), and may therefore increase effectiveness of cognitive training
 One of the mechanisms through which exercise and diet are thought to modulate brain plasticity is through their action on dopaminergic neurotransmission (5, )
 Indeed, several independent lines of basic research have demonstrated the involvement of dopamine signaling in learning (7-11) and neurobiological plasticity (12, )
 Furthermore, plasticity has been shown to be reduced in healthy aging (14) and linked to changes with beneficial effects on cognitive performance and learning in healthy adults (7, 8, -)
 We aimed to bridge the knowledge gap between clinical and basic sciences by isolating and studying the role of dopamine system in learning and neurobiological plasticity in a sample of older adults drawn from the general population
 In order to systematically implement this in the experimental setting, we designed the present randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial centred on transfer effects of working memory training to fluid intelligence (19, 20), which was selected as a primary outcome that may pick up task-independent training effects on working memory ability due to the important role that this ability plays in solving fluid intelligence task ()

 Age, sex, and the score on Ravens Progressive Matrices were used as stratifiers
  The randomisation was conducted using label shuffling with post-hoc non-parametric tests for the stratifiers and was run separately for each of the five waves using an R-script available at lebedev (RBTII repository)
 All participants and all staff involved in administering the drug, cognitive training, and outcome assessments were masked to group assignment
 To achieve masked drug administration, orange juice was mixed with L-dopa or administered as placebo
 This was prepared and labeled by a nurse who was not involved in any other aspect of the study
 The study implemented an intervention period of four weeks, with five visits each week (~
5 hours per visit, Monday-Friday), resulting in a maximum total of 20 intervention visits
 All procedures were identical for the intervention group and the control group
 Upon arrival, participants were given orange juice (with or without 100/25 mg of L-dopa/benserazide, trade name: Madopark Quick mite

 The time window between the administration of the orange juice and the start of the cognitive training (45 min) was aligned with expected peaks in drug concentrations and effects
 Similarly, total visit duration (
5 hours) was motivated by drug elimination curves, according to which plasma concentrations of the drug are negligible 
5 hours after the administration of L-dopa in combination with peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor ()
 Dose selection was motivated by the results from two longitudinal studies completed in the healthy younger population that demonstrated positive effects of the drug on learning and good tolerability (7, )
 The cognitive training was designed according to the current recommendations in that it was adaptive in nature, targeted more than one construct (updating and switching), and promoted process-based as opposed to strategy-based improvements by including several training tasks and varying stimuli sets ()
  The protocol incorporated three exercises: one focused on the ability to flexibly switch between different tasks (task-switching) and two others on the ability to continuously maintain and update mental representations (running span and n-back)
 Study outcomes included cognitive measures and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data collected in five behavioural and one MRI session in the week The primary behavioural outcomes were: (1) spatial fluid intelligence, as a latent variable (see Statistical Analysis) measured by the Ravens Progressive Matrices, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, and the BETA-III matrix reasoning test; and (2) verbal fluid intelligence, as a latent variable measured with the Analogies Task from Berlin Intelligence Structure Test, Syllogisms, and the Verbal Inference Test from the ETS Kit (See Supplement S1 for complete list)
 Selection of the primary outcomes was motivated by previous literature suggesting a possibility that working memory training can produce improvements in measures of fluid Secondary cognitive outcomes were measures of working memory, episodic memory, and task switching ability
 Structural brain imaging data were collected as a further secondary outcome

 For detailed description, see study protocol In order to quantify effective concentrations of the investigated drug, subjects blood samples were collected in the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-treated tubes at the first and last cognitive training visit, approximately 30-40 minutes after completing the training, to evaluate plasma levels of L-dopa and homovanillic acid
 Plasma separation was performed within 4-5 hours via a 30-minute centrifugation at g

70, and an alpha level (threshold for statistical significance) of

 The main analysis used an implementation of structural equation modeling with latent change score modeling (25) to test the effect of L-dopa versus placebo on the outcomes of cognitive training (see Supplement, Figure S2 and Table S)

 Latent variables were formed similarly for pre- and post-test assessments based on shared variance from multiple tests measuring each specific construct, and a latent change score, which related changes in this way, by forming a latent variable out of several tests, has the advantage of reducing the influence of measurement error and task-specific variance on the outcome measure, certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    We did not find evidence for beneficial effects of exogenous augmentation of dopaminergic neurotransmission on cognitive performance and learning in healthy older adults
 On the contrary, subjects receiving L-dopa improved less on visuospatial fluid intelligence, a primary outcome of the training intervention, after four weeks of working memory training compared to those who received placebo treatment
 Subjects receiving L-dopa also progressed worse during training when compared to placebo subjects
 The observed between-group differences in visuospatial fluid intelligence were still statistically significant 6 months after the intervention
 The groups also demonstrated opposite direction of structural changes in a midbrain region, overlapping with the template location of substantia nigra, which is a key regulatory region rich in dopamine neurons involved in learning and plasticity (28, )
 Specifically, the control group exhibited increases of grey matter volume in this region whereas the group that received L-dopa Although post-hoc, we interpret our results to suggest that the exogenous administration of the dopamine precursor may have perturbed a balanced dopaminergic system that previous studies has shown to be involved in training-related effects on performance ()
 This was also plasma concentrations of the drug observed in the active group
 The differential volumetric changes in the dopamine-rich region further support this interpretation
 Thus, whilst our results are not at odds with basic science that clearly implicates dopamine in learning and plasticity (10, 12, 13), they indicate that exogenous administration the dopamine precursor is rather negative than beneficial for the dopaminergic system in the healthy aging brain
 We also note that, despite some positive results from repeated L-dopa administrations on verbal learning domain reported in previous studies of younger adults (7, 16), our negative findings are in line with a recent study that showed detrimental effects of the same L-dopa dose on reward reversal learning in younger and older healthy adults, which were of the same magnitude irrespective of initial cognitive performance and expected baseline dopamine levels ()
 Further studies are clearly needed to pharmacological interventions may have differential effects, especially in the light of recent findings showing clear regional heterogeneity of age-related decline in dopamine receptor More generally, the negative response to pro-dopaminergic medication observed in the present study suggests that cognitive decline in healthy aging is a complex and multifactorial process, a process that appears to result in balanced physiological states, which, whilst being associated certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    with reduced overall self-regulatory capacity (32), still preserve mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity (33-35), which implies that activity within the dopaminergic circuit is regulated by intrinsic feedback loops to maintain optimally balanced levels of the neurotransmitter thereby preventing excessive increases in excitatory activity
 The negative effect observed in the present study appears to be the opposite of what is known as dopamine supersensitivity typically present in dopamine-deficient conditions (-)
 Translating this finding further to clinical and cognitive neuroscience, it is worth noting that although the dopamine system is affected in several ways in aging (15, 18, 31, 39), acute pro-dopaminergic supplementation appears to perturb a balanced system, with negative behavioural consequences
 This is fully in line with the results from positron emission tomography studies showing that despite apparent negative effects of age on dopamine transporters and receptor density in the healthy individuals, its synthesis capacity remains relatively unaffected ()
 It is also consistent with recent evidence indicating that the balance between dopamine release and receptor density is critical for cognitive performance ()
 In age-related neurodegenerative diseases, on the other hand, disruption of the homeostasis has reliably been observed and may even be the core ()
  Thus, it appears clear that aging should not be approached as a disease per se, but rather as a physiological process associated with a gradual decline in many interconnected biological and behavioural capacities
 Maintenance of the aging organism may therefore be best achieved by early investments in healthy lifestyle and multi-modal interventions affecting it (1, )
 Our results warrant more studies about the effects of L-dopa on brain and cognition in clinical populations, which often involve substantially higher dosages and longer time periods
 Indeed, even though dopamine replacement therapy has been shown to be successful for counteracting motor impairment associated with Parkinsons disease, studies that explore its effects on cognition have yielded mixed results (17, )
 The negative effects of L-dopa supplementation on learning and midbrain structures observed in our study present an urgent need to carefully investigate the longitudinal course of brain changes in de-novo Parkinsons patients, for which early dopamine replacement therapy is currently a subject of debates (43, )
  Some important study limitations need to be addressed
 The most important one is the absence of additional control groups not receiving any cognitive training interventions
 This limits interpretation of the results, as with only two groups we cannot unambiguously infer that the between-group differences are driven by the interaction of L-dopa with cognitive training and not by direct and prolonged effects of the drug on cognitive abilities or an interaction with re-test effects (which would still entail effects on learning but of a different kind)

 ;    of L-dopa is fast (blood concentrations are expected to be negligible when the subjects leave the training facility), and all subjects had minimum 24-hour washout period and were medication-free on pre- and post-testing days
 This, however, does not completely rule out a possibility of a cumulative effect on the brain concentrations, which, in turn, may drive the observed detrimental effects on performance
 In this context, it is also worth mentioning that L-dopa concentrations were significantly higher in the active group at the last compared to the first intake
 We interpret this finding as due to accelerated gut absorption of the drug previously reported in animal studies with repeated L-dopa administration ()
 Nevertheless, similar to the main results, the placebo group reached higher difficulty levels over the course of training in all tasks
 We think that these learning-related effects are the most likely explanation of the performance differences at post test, which may also explain why they were still present at long-term follow-up conducted 6 months after the intervention (at a point when differential L-dopa concentration between the groups are It is also important to acknowledge limitations of the MRI-derived measures of grey matter probability
 The differential changes in the midbrain were observed in measures that are derived from T1-weighted images, which are known to be highly sensitive to pharmacological manipulations ()
 We cannot determine whether the observed changes are due to true volumetric changes or whether they are a result of relatively transient changes in for example blood flow
 It is worth noting that the increases observed for the control group in the present study are consistent with previous reports of changes in the dopaminergic system induced by cognitive training ()
 In line with this background, we also hypothesise that the observed effects in the L-dopa group may reflect reactive changes in the dopamine system in response to In addition, even though our literature review indicated that the selected dosage was appropriate to induce the effects of interest with minimal side-effects, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that other drug amounts may lead to different results
 However, a negative and linear correlation between plasma concentrations of the drug and improvements in visuospatial reasoning observed in the active group, as well as absence of any moderating effects of the body-mass index on the aforementioned improvements make this possibility unlikely
 Finally, despite the fact that our study is well-powered and the largest of its kind (7, 16) an additional caution must be advised for making direct generalisations to broader populations, especially to patient We conclude that daily L-dopa supplementation does not enhance cognitive performance and learning during cognitive training in healthy older adults and may in fact have disadvantageous certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 Our findings raise serious concerns about usefulness of novel L-dopa-containing supplements that claim to have neuroprotective and learning-enhancing properties and suggest that caution is needed with regard to early dopamine replacement treatment interventions in neurological disorders, encouraging more rigorous evaluation of their effects on the brain and cognition in populations that often receive the drug in larger doses over long periods
