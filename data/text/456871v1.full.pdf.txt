 ;    Despite significant changes in neonatal care over the last several decades, late onset bacterial 102 sepsis (LOS) is still one of the leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality in 103 developing but also in highly developed countries [-]
 Although LOS is predominantly 104 caused by coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) (36-66% of cases), Gram-negative rods 105 are responsible for about 26-36% of cases [3, ]
  106 The early use of broad spectrum antibiotic regimens remains the cornerstone for the treatment 107 of LOS
 However, which antibiotic regimen should be used is still debatable, as relevant 108 studies were conducted more than 20 years ago, were single centre or single country, 109 insufficiently powered, evaluated antibiotics not in clinical use anymore and had variable 110 inclusion/exclusion criteria and outcome measures [5, ]
 As a result, most antibiotics are 111 prescribed off-label in neonates [7, 8] and treatment guidelines are based on expert opinion 112 rather than on evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCT) []
 As an example of this, 113 we showed that 49 different antibiotic regimens were used for the empiric treatment of LOS 114 in 111 patients across Europe []
 In addition, there is significant variation in antibiotic, 115 including meropenem, dosing in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) []
 The issue is now 116 further complicated by the rise of antibiotic resistance in NICUs worldwide [12] and the 117 Meropenem is a low protein-bound (2%), broad-spectrum carbapenem with activity against a 119 wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including anaerobes and extended 120 has been used off-label in NICUs for more than a decade [16] because of concerns around 122 high rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteria and is now the 123 second most commonly used antibiotic [11, ]

 However, there is serious concern  around selection of carbapenem-resistant Gram-126 The safety and effectiveness of meropenem was recently evaluated in a single arm study 128 including 200 infants < 91 days with suspected or confirmed intraabdominal infections
 In this 129 study, however, only 11% of patients received meropenem as monotherapy and only 15% 130 (29/200) had positive blood cultures
 The study demonstrated that meropenem was well 131 tolerated and efficacious []
 Meropenem was included in the European Medicines Agency 132 priority list of off-patent drugs for which studies in neonates are requested 133 The general aim of the study was to suggest the appropriate use of meropenem in settings 136 with low and medium level multi-drug resistance
 Thus, the efficacy and safety of meropenem 137 with a predefined standard of care (SOC) regimen for the treatment of LOS in patients 138 admitted to NICU were compared
 The distribution of LOS-causing microorganisms and their 139 antibiotic susceptibility, relapse- and new infection rates, short term outcome of LOS and 140 NeoMero-1 was a randomised, open-label study conducted in 18 NICUs in Estonia, Greece, 145 Italy, Lithuania, Spain and Turkey []

 ;    have shown that the mortality was low with both antibiotic regimens and the efficacy of 409 meropenem was similar to commonly used SOC combinations based on a complex composite 410 primary endpoint in the FAS population
 If only patients with culture proven LOS were 411 analysed the efficacy of meropenem was significantly greater than that of SOC in general but 412 there were no differences between study arms if Gram-positive and Gram-negative sepsis 413 were evaluated separately
 Furthermore, patients randomised to meropenem had a shorter 414 duration of antibacterial therapy than those randomised to SOC
 The two study arms were 415 similar in terms of adverse events and acquired perirectal colonisation by CRGNO
  416 The NeoMero1 study differed from previous studies in LOS in many ways
 First, it was a 417 multicentre study including countries with low to moderate antibiotic resistance rates 418 previous single center and/or national studies [5, ]
 Second, the demanding inclusion 420 criteria resulted in recruitment of a very sick patient population (e
 g
 55% mechanically 421 ventilated, 35% with BW of <1000g) compared to previous studies []
 Third, only 2% of 422 patients were ineligible (did not have LOS) and altogether 52% had culture proven LOS as 423 opposed to 15% in a recent study of complicated intraabdominal infections []
 Fourth, 424 NeoMero1 had an ambitious primary endpoint that in addition to resolution or significant 425 improvement of clinical and laboratory criteria, did not allow any changes of allocated 426 therapy such as deviations from fixed treatment duration, dosing and/or addition of another 427 antibiotic, in contrast to more liberal or less specific endpoints in previous studies [5, ]
 428 The most intriguing finding of this study, in comparison to others, was a relatively low 429 success rate in terms of the composite primary endpoint in both study arms (23% in SOC vs
 430 32% in meropenem), while mortality rates were much lower than in previous studies of LOS 431 and in a recent Egyptian study comparing conventional and prolonged infusion of meropenem 432 []
 The low efficacy rate was mainly driven by the modification of allocated therapy and 433 not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    most of all by its fixed duration of 8 to 14 days
 The effect of the latter was clearly 434 demonstrated in the post-hoc analysis in which reducing the allowed treatment duration by 435 just one day (from 8 to 7 days) improved the success rate from 32% to 48% in the meropenem 436 and from 23% to 27% in the SOC arms
 We believe that this was due to the clinicians 437 decision to stop antibiotics earlier than the pre-defined duration, presumably because they felt 438 that clinically the sepsis episode had resolved and the infant had recovered
 The optimal 439 duration of antibiotic therapy in LOS is not known []
 440 In contrast to previous studies, we did not find an association between carbapenem use and 441 CRGNO colonization [-]
 Of note, our study was an RCT with strict inclusion criteria, in 442 contrast to previous retrospective and/or observational studies which included all patients 443 without restriction [25, 27, ]
 We should emphasize that the relatively short duration 444 (median of 9 days) of meropenem treatment in the NeoMero1 study may be relevant
 For 445 example, Clock et al (2016) showed in an observational study that perirectal colonisation 446 with Gram-negative multi-drug resistant bacteria was associated with >10 days of meropenem 447 In line with previous studies, meropenem was well tolerated and all AEs in this very sick 449 patient population were well balanced between study arms []
 Seizures, previously reported 450 to be related to meropenem treatment [29], were seen in higher numbers in the meropenem 451 arm but due to very low numbers no meaningful conclusions can be drawn
 452 The study had a few limitations
 First, it was an open label study with the risk of investigator -453 induced bias when evaluating the primary endpoint or changing allocated therapy
 An open 454 label design was selected because meropenem monotherapy was to be compared with a 455 combination of comparator agents

 ;    ethical perspective
 We also note that the most appropriate targets for meropenem are Gram-458 negative microorganisms, especially those resistant to other antibiotics like ESBL or AmpC 459 producing organisms
 Despite the demanding inclusion criteria, that well discriminated 460 between patients with and without LOS, these criteria performed poorly in distinguishing 461 between cases caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms; about half of the 462 recruited patients still had Gram-positive infections
 As long as rapid and reliable methods or 463 biomarkers, which allow differentiation between different species, are not available, 464 recruitment of mixed population into similar studies is unavoidable
  To target antibiotic 465 therapy more precisely, rapid and reliable tests that enable identification of microorganisms 466 and/or their antibiotic resistance, and biomarkers that differentiate between infections and 467 NeoMero1 is the first adequately powered RCT for LOS since the 1970s [5, 6] but several 469 outstanding issues require further studies to be done
 For example, the question of best 470 treatment options for LOS in developing countries and/or in areas with high antibiotic 471 resistance rates was not addressed as 92% of microorganisms were susceptible to meropenem 472 and 72% at least to one component of SOC
 As shown by us, RCTs in LOS treatment are 473 challenging due to a vulnerable population and lack of validated disease criteria and endpoints 474 [5, 6, ]
 There is an urgent need for cooperation between academia, pharmaceutical industry 475 and regulators in innovating clinical research in neonatology, including defining alternative 476 and more feasible study designs (e
 g
 pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, rather than solely 477 clinical endpoint based designs, enabling modelling/simulation and extrapolation from studies 478 in adults) [6, ]
 It is critical to provide efficacy data for those infected with organisms 479 covered specifically or exclusively by study antibiotics (e
 g
 ESBL or AmpC producing 480 not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    We have also shown that the LOS criteria developed by an European Medicines Agency 482 expert group [5] were able to discriminate well between patients with and without LOS, but 483 further improvement and validation of these criteria is needed before adopting and 484 implementing them into clinical trials
 Indeed, other definitions have been published, which 485 use fewer clinical and laboratory parameters, but to the best of our knowledge, these have not 486 been tested or used in large RCTs []
 The recent STROBE-NI consensus for reporting 487 neonatal sepsis trials should help with this in the future []
 488 Conclusion: In predominantly premature critically ill infants with LOS in Europe, 489 meropenem treatment was not superior to SOC in terms of success at TOC, short-term hearing 490 disturbances, safety or mortality
 However, meropenem monotherapy resulted in slightly 491 shorter treatment duration
 Meropenem did not lead to enhanced colonization with CRGNOs
 492 We recommend that meropenem should be reserved for seriously ill premature neonates with 493 suspected or proven Gram-negative LOS, especially in NICUs in which microorganisms 494 We would like to thank all patients and their parents participating in this study
