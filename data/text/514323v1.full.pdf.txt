 ;    BackgroundHypertension (HTN) is a known risk factor for heart failure (HF), possibly via 2 the mechanism of cardiac remodeling and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)
 We studied how 3 much blood pressure (BP) change and evolving LVH contribute to the effect that lisinopril, 4 Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) data
 ALLHAT participants with available 7 serial ECGs and BP measurements were included (n=29,892; mean age 674 y; 32% black; 56% 8 men): 11,008 were randomized to chlorthalidone, 5,967  to doxazosin, 6,593  to amlodipine, 9 and 6,324  to lisinopril
 Evolving ECG-LVH, and BP-lowering served as mediators
 Incident 10 symptomatic HF was the primary outcome
 Linear regression (for mediator) and logistic 11 regression (for outcome) models were adjusted for mediator-outcome confounders (demographic 12 and clinical characteristics known to be associated both with both LVH/HTN and HF)
  13 ResultsA large majority of participants (96%) had ECG-LVH status unchanged; 4% 14 developed evolving ECG-LVH
 On average, BP decreased by 11/7 mmHg
 In adjusted Cox 15

 After full 17 adjustment, evolving ECG-LVH mediated 4% of the effect of doxazosin on HF
 Systolic BP-18 lowering mediated 12% of the effect of doxazosin, and diastolic BP-lowering mediated 10% 19 effect of doxazosin, 7% effect of amlodipine, and borderline 9% effect of lisinopril on HF

1 HTN triggers cardiac 4 remodeling and development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), leading to subclinical organ 5 damage, which evolves to clinically manifest HF, and ultimately, death
 The beneficial effect of 6 antihypertensive treatment on HF risk is well-known,3 and reflected in the 2017 ACC/AHA 7 Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in 8 Adults
4 HTN treatment is associated with an approximately 20-25% reduction in risk of incident 9 The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial 11 (ALLHAT)6 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial designed to 12 compare cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in high-risk antihypertensive patients assigned to the 13 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) lisinopril, the calcium channel blocker (CCB) 14 amlodipine, and the -blocker doxazosin, in comparison to a thiazide-type diuretic 15 (chlorthalidone)
 Incident HF was a pre-specified ALLHAT outcome
 The rationale for the 16 ALLHAT hypothesis was based on the previous demonstrations that ACEIs and CCBs are more 17 effective than diuretics in reducing left ventricular mass index, measured by echocardiography
7 18 Contrary to expectations, the ALLHAT showed that chlorthalidone was superior to amlodipine, 19 lisinopril, and doxazosin in preventing HF

 The extent to which the effect of a CCB, ACEi, and an -blocker (as compared to a 1 diuretic) on incident HF is mediated by evolving LVH and blood pressure (BP) lowering per se 2 remains unknown
 This study aimed to quantify the extent to which the effect of lisinopril, 3 amlodipine, and doxazosin (as compared to chlorthalidone) on incident HF is mediated by 4 evolving LVH and BP lowering
 We hypothesized that evolving ECG LVH and BP lowering are 5 mechanisms behind previously observed differences in the rate of incident HF in hypertensive 6 ALLHAT participants randomized to lisinopril, amlodipine, and doxazosin, in comparison to 7 For this study, we used the ALLHAT dataset, publicly available from the National Heart, 10 Lung, and Blood Institute, via BioLINCC
 The study was reviewed by an Oregon Health and 11 Science University Institutional Review Board and determined that it did not require further 12 review due to the de-identified nature of publicly available dataset
  13 The ALLHAT design and rationale have been described previously
6 Briefly, ALLHAT 15 enrolled adults age 55 and above, with HTN and at least one risk factor [documented coronary 16 heart disease (CHD), type II diabetes mellitus, LVH on ECG or echocardiogram, smoking, high-17 density lipoprotein (HDL) < 35mg/dL, or ST-T ECG changes indicative of ischemia]
 18 Symptomatic HF patients or those with LVEF <35%, patients with recent myocardial infarction 19 In this study, we included ALLHAT participants with available assessment of evolving LVH 21 status, and dynamic BP changes

  2 ECGs were recorded at the study sites at baseline and biannually during follow-up
 4 Minnesota coding13 of serial ECG changes (Table 1) was performed in the ECG core center at 5 the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis by reviewers who were blinded to treatment 6 assignments
 Minnesota codes 3-1 and 3-3 are high left R amplitude patterns (relevant to LVH) 7 as measured on the next to last complete normal beat
 Code 3-1 was coded if any of the 8 following 3 criteria are present: (1) R amplitude >26 mm in either lead V5 or V6; (2) R 9 amplitude >20 mm in any of leads I, II, III, or aVF; (3) R amplitude >12 mm in lead aVL
 Code 10 3-3 was coded if one or both of the following two criteria is present: (1) R-wave amplitude >15 11 mm but 20 mm in lead I; R-wave amplitude in V5 or V6 plus S or QS amplitude in V1 >35 12 Serial ECG changes were assessed during follow-up, which required at least two ECGs
 LVH 14 was examined in clinic (non-hospital) ECG recordings
 The Minnesota Code allowed for 15 objective classification of evolving LVH over time by setting limits to the percentage of change 16 in voltage that occurs in serial ECGs (Table )
 At the first step, it was determined in which lead 17 the most severe 3-code occurred
 Code 3-1 was considered more severe than Code -
 If both 18 ECGs had the same 3-code, the follow-up record determined which lead to use to compare with 19 the reference ECG
 If the 3-code occurred in different leads, the following hierarchy was used to 20 determine which lead to compare: V5 /V6 (whichever R-amplitude is higher)>I>II>III> aVL
  21 Evolving LVH (Table 1) was coded as either significant progression (including newly 22 diagnosed ECG-LVH), or significant resolution (including complete resolution of ECG-LVH)

 To 6 calculate achieved BP lowering during the trial, we subtracted baseline BP from the BP obtained 7 at the latest in-trial study visit available at year 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 from baseline, thus obtaining 8 estimates of the greatest BP control
 In addition, we conducted sensitivity analyses with three 9 other definitions of BP lowering
 By subtracting baseline BP from the BP obtained at the next in-10 trial study visit available, we obtained estimates of the fastest BP control
 We also divided the 11 greatest and fastest BP control estimates by the baseline BP, obtaining relative greatest and 12 Incident symptomatic congestive HF as defined by the ALLHAT investigators was a primary 15 outcome in this study
 Diagnosis of symptomatic congestive HF required the presence of both: 16 (1) Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or dyspnea at rest, or New York Heart Association class III 17 symptomps, or orthopnea, and (2) rales, or ankle edema (2+ or greater), or sinus tachycardia of 18 120 beats/minute or more after 5 minutes at rest, or cardiomegaly by chest X-ray, or chest X-ray 19 characteristic of congestive HF, or S3 gallop, or jugular venous distention

1 years follow-up in 7 doxazosin group, and 
0 years in other 3 groups, there were 2,049 incident HF outcomes, 8 Overall, 58,366 serial ECG changes were evaluated
 ECG-LVH resolution was observed in 11 about 2% of participants, and in another 2% ECG-LVH progressed (Table )
 The majority of 12 participants had no evolving ECG-LVH changes
 ALLHAT participants with evolving ECG-13 LVH were more likely black males, current smokers with lower BMI, but less likely having 14 CHD/MI history
 As expected, baseline ECG-LVH was more frequent in participants with 15 resolving ECG-LVH
 Baseline LVH by echocardiogram was similar in all 3 groups, and was 16 very infrequent (-%)
 Participants with resolving LVH by ECG were more likely diabetic, less 17 likely to have been treated before the onset of the trial, and achieved the greatest degree of BP-18 lowering in-trial Incident HF was significantly more frequent in participants with evolving 19 ECG-LVH (Table )

 Q1, Q2, and Q3 of the 5 fastest BP-lowering were -28/-1610/6 mmHg, -7/-45/3 mmHg, and +14/812/6 mmHg, 6 accordingly
 Hispanic ethnicity, previously untreated HTN, higher baseline levels of SBP/DBP 7 (Figure 3) and baseline ECG-LVH were associated with greater SBP and DBP lowering in-trial 8 (Table )
 In contrast, presence of diabetes was associated with a SBP increase of nearly 2 9 mmHg
 Older age was associated with greater SBP-lowering but slight DBP-increase
 History of 10 CHD/CVD did not affect the degree of BP-lowering in-trial Compared to chlorthalidone, 11 doxazosin was associated with significant SBP increase (by nearly 2 mmHg), whereas 12 amlodipine was associated with significant SBP and DBP decrease
 Lisinopril was associated 13 with greater DBP (but not SBP) lowering than chlorthalidone (Table )
 Participants in the 14 doxazosin arm who developed HF had the greatest degree of BP-lowering (both SBP/DBP) in-15 trial (~6/2 mmHg lower than by diuretic), which contrasted with overall weak BP-lowering 16 As expected, age, ethnicity, history of HTN, CHD, and CVD, as well as ECG-LVH were 19 associated with increased risk of HF (Table )

  3 The association of in-trial BP changes with HF was non-linear (Figure )
 Both large 4 decrease and poor control of BP were associated with incident HF, but large decrease in BP had 5 a stronger effect than poor BP control on both primary and secondary outcomes (Table )
 A 6 similar association of SBP-lowering with incident HF was observed in three out of four treatment 7 groups (Figure )
 In the amlodipine treatment group, SBP change was not associated with 8 incident HF (Pinteraction=

 A noticeable U-shaped association of DBP-change with 9 incident symptomatic HF was observed in the amlodipine and chlorthalidone treatment groups 10 (Figure 8), whereas poor DBP control in the lisinopril and doxazosin treatment groups was not 11 In fully adjusted analyses, evolving LVH mediated 4% of the effect of doxazosin on HF 14 (Table )
 Both direct and mediated pathways contributed to the increased HF risk in doxazosin 15 arm

 The effects of 1 amlodipine and lisinopril on HF were entirely independent of SBP changes
 2 DBP-lowering mediated 10% of the effect of doxazosin, and 7% of the effect of amlodipine, 3 and 9% of the effect of lisinopril on HF
 In fully adjusted analyses (Table 5) mediation of the 4 effect of lisinopril lost statistical significance
 Both direct and mediated pathways had the same 5 Sensitivity analyses with different definitions of BP-lowering provided similar results (Table 7 )
 The fastest SBP-lowering mediated ~13% of the effect of lisinopril on HF
 8 The main finding of our study is that the evolving ECG-LVH and BP-lowering explain up to 10 13% of the HF-preventive effect of diuretic chlorthalidone, as compared to the preventive effect 11 of antihypertensive treatment with the alpha-blocker doxazosin, the ACEi lisinopril, and the 12 CCB amlodipine
 This finding highlights the notion of HF as a complex multifactorial condition, 13 and underscores importance of the use of diuretics for HF prevention, which targets mechanisms 14 that are largely independent of BP-lowering and evolving ECG-LVH
  15 HTN is the major risk factor of HF, associated with 2-3 fold increased HF incidence in 17 observational cohort studies
17 However, RCTs HTN treatment is associated with only 20-25% 18 reduction in HF risk
 Our study provided consistent findings: BP-lowering mediated only up to 19 13% effect of antihypertensive medications on incident HF
 Such disconnect between a risk 20 factor and effect of its modification is traditionally explained by poor BP control, irreversible 21 damage of the heart over long-time risk exposure, insufficient awareness of HTN, and 22 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Our study findings suggest that in 1 order to achieve the most effective HF prevention, BP-lowering should not be the only criterion 2 of HTN treatment effectiveness
 Moreover, as different antihypertensive treatments have 3 different mediators, different criteria of effectiveness (beyond BP-control) should be developed 4 Our study showed that mechanisms by which the thiazide diuretic chlorthalidone prevented 7 HF were not restricted to BP-lowering and prevention of LVH
 The mechanisms responsible for 8 favorable effect of chlorthalidone on HF prevention in HTN persons are unknown

18 Better understanding of the mechanisms 11 behind the effect of chlorthalidone on HF may lead to new drug formulations, specifically 12 Longstanding HTN and LVH can start a devastating cascade that leads to HF via myocyte 15 growth, oxidative stress, and fibrosis
19 While antihypertensive drugs have been shown to reduce 16 and even reverse LVH, this study showed that reduction in ECG-LVH increased the risk of HF, 17 as compared to patients who remained free from LVH
  18 In the current study, evolving LVH mediated only 4% of the effect of doxazosin on HF

21 Differences between LVH measured by ECG vs
 LV mass measured 1 by imaging modalities 21 reflect true differences between the cardiac anatomy and the 2 substrate, which is associated with sudden cardiac death and incident HF independent of LV 4 mass and BP control -
 Additional ECG measures of electrophysiological substrate should be 5 considered as potential mediators of antihypertensive treatment effect on HF
 For example, sum 6 absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST) was shown associated with HF hospitalization or death in 7 MADIT II study
25 Longitudinal changes in global electrical heterogeneity (GEH) were 8 beyond evolving LVH (e
 g
 using SAI QRST and GEH) may improve understanding of 10 mechanisms, responsible for HF development in the setting of HTN
 11 Our findings are largely consistent with previous ALLHAT results and conclusions
27 13 Previous analysis of attributable risks due to BP-lowering28 concluded that effect of amlodipine 14 on incident HF was BP-independent, whereas BP-lowering only partially explained the effect of 15 lisinopril on HF
 In our adjusted mediation analysis, effect of both amlodipine and lisinopril on 16 HF was entirely independent of SBP, whereas DBP-lowering mediated 7% effect of amlodipine 17 and 9% effect of lisinopril
 Interestingly, we observed opposite directions of the direct effect of 18 doxazosin (increased HF risk), and SBP-lowering-mediated effect of doxazosin (reduced HF risk 19 by %)
 DBP-lowering mediated 10% effect of doxazosin, and had the same direction with the 20 direct effect of doxazosin
 As doxazosin remains a viable HTN treatment option for men with 21 benign prostatic hyperplasia, complex effects of BP-lowering on incident HF should be taken 22 into account for patients on doxazosin
