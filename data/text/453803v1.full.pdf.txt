 ;    patient were analyzed by ultra-deep sequencing to an average of 35,000X of the coding regions RESULTS The cohort consists of a quarter of benign lung diseases and three quarters of cancer patients with all histopathology subtypes
 64% of the cancer patients is at Stage I
 Gene mutations detection in tissue gDNA and plasma ctDNA results in a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of %
 When ctDNA assay was used as the test, the sensitivity was 69% and specificity %
 As for the lung cancer patients, the assay detected 63%, 83%, 94% and 100%, for Stage I, II, III and IV, respectively
 In a linear discriminant analysis, combination of ctDNA, patient age and a panel of serum biomarkers boosted the overall sensitivity to 80% at a specificity of %
 29 out of the 65 genes harbored mutations in the lung cancer patients with the largest number found in TP53 (30% plasma and 62% tumor tissue samples) and EGFR (20% and 40%, respectively)
 CONCLUSION Plasma ctDNA was analyzed in lung nodule assessment and early cancer detection Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, accounting for an estimated 
6 million deaths each year globally ()
 The prognosis of lung cancer is dependent on the stage of diagnosis, with 5-year overall survival rate decreasing dramatically from stage IA (85%) to stage IV disease (6%) (2, )
 This makes it clearly a winning strategy to screen and diagnose lung cancer earlier to Current method for lung cancer screening is low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) ()
 The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality for LDCT compared with X ray and a 
7% all-cause mortality reduction ()
 However, the imagery technique often results in indeterminate nodules (6) and the false positive results lead to unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures and increased deaths from avoidable surgeries ()
  Traditionally, biopsy is used to determine malignancy of lung nodules
 This approach has significant limitations as being difficult or even impossible

 ;    biofluid samples, so called liquid biopsy, are promising and urgently needed in the thoracic clinic, as demonstrated in thyroid nodules assessment where a number of molecular tests are available ()
 In pulmonary nodule malignancy assessment, there is also the report of blood proteomics In theory, ctDNA is exquisitely specific for an individual's tumor as by definition somatic mutations are identified by their presence in tumor DNA and absence in matched normal DNA
 This bypasses the issues related to the false-positivity encountered with other biomarkers, such as protein biomarkers
 This specific and promising early detection method has garnered tremendous attention for cancer in general and lung in particular (,)
 The growing interest has drawn attention from international societies such as IASLC that has issued statement regarding liquid biopsy in the management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ()
 Early detection of cancer by blood test was shown possible even with microscopic tumor proceeding radiography ()
 Most recently, a preliminary analysis of early to mid-stage (stage I-III) lung cancer patients as part of the Circulating Cancer Genome Atlas (CCGA) pan-cancer study In addition to mutation analysis, ctDNA epigenetics has also been evaluated and researched for early cancer detection
 The studies examined DNA methylation regulation (15) or the hypermethylation of the promoter regions of genes (16) for the potential biomarkers of lung In this study, we report a multi-center clinical trial result on ultra-deep sequencing in patients that undergo surgical resection either benign nodules or with different stages of lung cancer
  The clinical trial (ClinicalTrialgov NCT03081741) at four Tier A hospitals in China recruited patients with lung occupying diseases to be treated by surgery
 Patients with benign lung nodules or cancers of Stage I to III planned for surgical resection were eligible for inclusion (Table S)

 ;    biological samples (two tubes of 10mL peripheral blood prior to surgery collected in a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) BCT blood collection tube (Streck, Omaha, US) and 10 slides of formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues from surgery), and related clinical data including serum biomarkers were collected
  The above collected DNA samples were analyzed by our proprietary Sec-Seq technique as described previously ()
 Briefly, blood sample were processed to separate the plasma from blood cells by centrifugation
 cfDNA, gDNA of WBC and FFPE were extracted using QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Aid Kit, DNA mini kit, DNA FFPE Tissue kit, respectively (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
 The concentration of extracted DNA was measured using Qubit 
0 dsDNA high-sensitivity assay (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
  Capture probes were designed for 65 cancer-associated genes covering 241kb genomic regions (Table S2) and synthesized by IDT (MI, USA)
 Indexed libraries were constructed using KAPA HyperPlus Kit (KK)
 Barcoding was employed to reduce noise
 Post-capture multiplexed libraries were amplified with Illumina backbone primers for 16 cycles of PCR using 1 KAPA HiFi Hot Start Ready Mix and sequenced on Illumina Horizons Partners Spike-in control (Horizon, Cambridge, UK) was used in a serial dilution (from 
0005 to 1) using the wild-type reference genome and the provided reference standard
 Reference variants include EGFR (L858R, T790M), KRAS (G12D), NRAS (Q61K, A59T) and PIK3CA (E545K), or NA12878 (12 mutations) Reads with quality score <30 or havinh > 5% of positions differ from the rest of the reads targeting the same region were removed
 The results were then mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) using BWA (v
 
 -r)
 We used the start mapping positions, the length and the dual barcode on both side of merged paired-end fragments to form reads groups amplified from every primary cfDNA molecules and Variant calling for single nucleotide variation (SNV) or insertion/deletion (INDEL) was performed using samtools mpileup tool (v
 
 )
 For ctDNA samples, a variant was selected as a candidate somatic mutation when (1) two distinct paired reads (each redundantly sequenced at least three times) contained the mutation, (2) effective reads depth >500 (captured primary cfDNA molecules > 500) and (3) the certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    The variants were called by SnpEff (v
3o), and annotated by COSMIC (v85), ExAc, ClinVar, and 1000 Genome
 The following variants were eliminated: (1) intergenomic or intronic (except for splicing junction); (2) synonymous; (3) variant allele frequency (VAF) <
2% in ctDNA or <1% in FFPE samples
 Previously reported and confirmed pathogenic mutations in the clinical samples of lung cancer of all human races Data were summarized using descriptive statistics
 Fishers exact test was used to compare any two subgroups
 Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare median age between any two subgroups (Stage Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed on improving mutation analysis
 The model considers the age of the patients, ctDNA mutations, and the serum biomarkers
 It was developed using the 10 fold cross validation by dividing the samples into training and validation subsets
 The test sensitivity and In total, 192 patients with pulmonary space occupying lesions (136 malignant and 56 benign) pathologically diagnosed and surgically treated were included in this analysis
 These patients were recruited from 4 clinical sites: Xiangya No

 ;    For the benign lesions, the most common diseases diagnosed are pneumonia (n=14, 25%), tuberculosis (n=12, 21%), pulmonary fibrosis (n=4, 7%), and necrosis granuloma (n=3, %)
  Lung cancer distribution was 87, 29, and 17 in Stages I, II and III, respectively

 For ctDNA, the average sequencing depth is 35000 with 1350 unique In total, 312 occurrences and 274 unique somatic mutations were found in 29 genes from either plasma ctDNA or tissue DNA in 120 cancer and 5 benign cases
 No mutations were found in 14 In the benign lesions, 2 out of 56 patients (
6%) had 4 non-driver gene mutations in ctDNA, and Among the lung cancer patients, 88% (120 out of 136 patients) were found to harbor at least one mutation in ctDNA or tumor tissue
 When analyzed by stage of cancer, the class, that is whether driver or non-driver mutation, and number of mutations increase as the stage advances (Figure Mutations were found in 9 known lung cancer genes of ALK, BRAF, EGFR, HER2, KRAS, MET, NRAS, PIK3CA, and ROS1 (Fig

 ;    The most commonly occurred mutation is EGFR L858R (found in 24 samples) followed by EGFR exon 19 deletion (in 15 samples)
 The largest number of mutations was found in a patient who Concordance is defined as at least one gene mutation is the same in both the plasma ctDNA and the FFPE tumor tissue gDNA of a patient
 When completely no mutations were found in both the blood ctDNA and tissue gDNA, it is also considered as concordant of the two samples
 Among the 136 malignant cases, the overall concordance rate is %
 Among the concordant patients, 35 of them share at least one mutation in blood and tissue samples, and 15 of them had no mutations in either the ctDNA or tissue samples
 Concordance was higher in the driver genes, %
 The shared mutation rate increases as the stage of the cancer advances: 32%, 78%, 50%, and 67% at Stage I, II, III, and IV, respectively (Figure S)
 A panel of six serum protein tumor biomarkers was also analyzed which has a sensitivity of 51% with a specificity of 83% (Table )
 These markers include NSE, CYFRA 21-1, CEA, ProGRP, CA-125, and SCC
 When the most sensitive marker of CYFRA 21-1 was considered alone, the sensitivity In comparison, the profiling by ctDNA showed a higher sensitivity in detecting lung cancer
 The sensitivity increases as the stage advances and ctDNA outperform the serum biomarkers in all The mutation profiling classifies the lung nodules from benign to malignant (Figure )
 The benign samples harbor very little to no mutations
 The cancer patients have increasing level of mutations both in terms of category and numbers as stage progresses

 ;    For lung cancer detection, the overall sensitivity of plasma ctDNA was 68% at the specificity of %
 Slightly higher detection rate was observed in tissue DNA which reached 78% (Table )
 According to cancer stages, the sensitivity rate is 60%, 69%, 94%, and 100% for Stage I, II, III, and We further conducted a linear discriminant analysis where patient age, smoking status, and serum protein markers were considered (Figure S)
 The combined model of ctDNA mutations and serum biomarkers improved the sensitivity and specificity to 80% and 99% respectively Lung cancer screening recommended by the guidelines targets populations at high risk of developing lung cancer, such as patients aged above 55 years, heavy smokers and having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and with family history of lung cancer
 In general, by definition of 50  500 mm3 (19), screening by imagery techniques could result in about 30-40% indeterminate nodules that need to be further evaluated
 In our cohort, we have >60% nodules in this size range making it an urgent need for malignancy assessment
 Our patient population drawn from major hospitals in southern and central China has a median age of 
5 years, just above the threshold for lung cancer screening
 The clinical outcome confirmed the age as a risk factor for lung cancer: the median age of the patients with benign nodules (
1 years) was about ten years younger than those having lung cancer (median age of Smoking status and family history were not significantly different between the benign and the malignant cases in our cohort
 One possible explanation could be that the impact of smoking should be considered more broadly than tabaco smoking alone
 For example, the time spent on Chinese style cooking could be a potential risk
 Unfortunately, no such data were collected
 As a proxy, however, the gender distribution difference could be explored since female usually spends certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 While we have more male patients in the cancer group (about 60%), the opposite is true for the benign group which has less (about %)
  It is reported that tumor burden of lung cancer corresponds to its size ()
 Our data confirms that the size of the nodule relates to malignancy and progression
 The average tumor size increases from 22mm in Stage I to 38mm in Stage II and to 50mm in Stage III (Table )
 However, there is no significant difference between a benign nodule and that of the Stage I cancer (Table The concordance rate between tissue and corresponding plasma ctDNA also reflects the challenge of early cancer liquid biopsy
 Our study is heavy in Stage I patients (64%, Table 2) which has a rate of 32% and causes the overall rate of %
 The rate increases as stage advances  up to the highest of 78% and the average of Stage I-III is %
 In CCGA, a set of 73 early to mid-stage (stage I-III) lung cancer samples showed a similar rate of 59% (CI = 47-70%) ()
 In another very small study of 31 paired lung cancer tissues and plasma DNA samples with 10,000-fold ctDNA sequencing depth, the concordance of mutation between tumor tissue DNA and ctDNA was merely 
9% ()
 Ours is more like CCGA in that we both sequenced ctDNA to the depth >,X
 Another meta-analysis has also put the pooled sensitivity in the range of 60%s ()
 The gene mutations shared between the plasma ctDNA and the FFPE tumor tissue increase as the lung cancer stage advances
 This is in alignment with the previous report that Stage IV tumor has the highest concordance (23), as well as that as the tumor is getting larger, the amount of DNA fragments it sheds into the blood stream will increase (,)
  Although somatic mutations showed strong feasibility of detecting malignancy and staging the cancer by plasma ctDNA, there more factors to be considered
 Therefore, combining clinical and genomic features improved the test performance as shown by our LDA modeling (Table )
 Integrated classifiers have also been explored in terms of plasma protein biomarkers such as the Liquid biopsy starts moving into cancer clinics in therapy selection (26, reviewed in )
 For early detection of lung cancer, one study involving 60 NSCLC patients, 40 COPD patients and 40 healthy controls showed that serum cfDNA concentrations and integrity may be valuable ()

 ;    study identified 17 miRNA species in the exosomes of the blood that are differentially expressed in cancer (both NSCLC and SCLC) and controls ()
 The potential use of ctDNA for early detection There are, however, a number of limitation and challenges
 First of all, the sample sizes of the early detection studies are usually small especially the number of healthy controls
 Second, ctDNA amount correlates with cancer stage ()
 Therefore, the consensus is that ultra-deep sequencing of 40,000X is required to detect the low frequency mutations in the 10mL blood
 Finally, the less than expected driver mutation concordance between ctDNA and tumor DNA may reflect genetic heterogeneity and indicate tumor evolution (32) suggesting that other types of Some biomarkers for lung cancer in blood can be present in patients without identifiable radiological nodules and thus precede the apparition of these nodules
