 We performed

 Both -HESS and multiple MR methods consistently showed a putative causal effect of type 2 diabetes on cataract, with estimated liability-scale MR odds ratios (ORs) at around

 ;    Type 2 diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in East Asians1, and cataract is a major cause of vision impairment among patients with type 2 diabetes
 Previous studies2, 3 have revealed a strong phenotypic association between type 2 diabetes and cataract for East Asians
 For instance, Foster et al conducted a cross-sectional study of 1,206 Singapore Chinese and found patients with diabetes had higher risks for obtaining cortical cataract
 Another Asian population-based study recruited 10,033 participants and identified diabetes as a significant risk The phenotypic association between type 2 diabetes and cataract could be partially explained by their shared genetics4, 
 As pieces of evidence for disclosing their shared genetics, Lee et al4 analyzed a Hong Kong Chinese cohort and found cataract is common in patients with type 2 et al5 identified multiple candidate genes that had significantly different expression levels in the type 2 diabetes patients with higher Lens Opacities Classification System (LOCS) score (i
 e
, a system used to grade age-related cataract6), comparing to the patients with zero or minor LOCS score
 However, the magnitude of the genetic association between type 2 diabetes and cataract remains unclear, as does the problem of whether their genetic association Traditional methods estimate the shared genetics by comparing the concordance between monozygotic and dizygotic twins7, and establish causal conclusions using the randomized (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    controlled trials (RCTs)8, a widely accepted gold standard for causal inference
 However, these methods are occasionally limited or impracticable due to their own methodological weakness, such as the laborious data collection process and unethical study design
 With the development of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) during past decades, some alternatively feasible statistical methods have been proposed to estimate the shared genetics between focal traits directly using the GWAS summary data
 For instance, Bulik-Sullivan et al10 developed a technique named linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) to estimate the contributions of polygenic genetic effects for a focal trait (i
 e
, single-trait heritability) and the magnitude of shared genetic overlap underlying two traits (i
 e
, cross-trait genetic correlation)
 Shi et al11 extended LDSC and proposed heritability estimation from summary statistics (-HESS), a method to quantify the local single-trait heritability and cross-trait genetic correlation from approximately LD-independent genomic regions
 For pair of traits with significant genetic correlation, Mendelian randomization (MR)12 methods are capable of inferring the potential genetic causal relationship between traits using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instruments
 To further investigate any putative functional genes underlying the susceptibility to a trait, Zhu et al13 proposed summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR), which is an approach to identify gene expressions in an association with a target trait, by integrating GWAS summary data with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) summary data
 In this study, we leveraged the large East Asian population-based GWAS summary statistics of type 2 diabetes and cataract from BioBank Japan Project (BBJ)14 to comprehensively investigate the shared genetics between the two diseases
 We applied LDSC, -HESS, and (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    seven MR or MR-equivalent approaches to estimate the genetic correlation, local genetic correlation, and potential genetic causality between type 2 diabetes and cataract, respectively
 We also conducted SMR to the single-trait GWAS (i
 e
, type 2 diabetes, cataract) and cross-trait GWAS meta-analyses of type 2 diabetes and cataract to explore candidate genes involved in the causality between two diseases
 A brief overview of our study is summarized in Fig
 
 We downloaded the GWAS summary statistics of type 2 diabetes15 and cataract16 from the BBJ and genotype data from ~200,000 Japanese individuals (
10% male; average baseline age at 
70 for men and 
50 for women)
 Both type 2 diabetes and cataract were diagnosed by physicians
 The GWAS of type 2 diabetes was generated using a fixed-effect inverse-variance meta-analysis via METAL17, comprising 36,614 cases and 155,150 controls of four Japanese ancestry-based cohorts
 The GWAS of cataract was generated from 24,622 cases and 187,831 controls using a linear mixed model via SAIGE18, adjusted by age, sex, and top five principal We applied LDSC10, 19 to estimate the liability-scale heritability (h2) of type 2 diabetes and cataract as well as their genetic correlation (rg)
 GWAS summary statistics were filtered according to the HapMap3 reference

 ;    had minor allele frequency <
01, or located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region (chromosome 6: 28,477,79733,448,354) due to the complicated LD structure in this region
 The LD scores were pre-computed based on the 481 East Asians in 1000 performed to estimate the liability-scale h2 of type 2 diabetes and cataract, assuming the population and sample prevalence at 
50%15 and 
10%15 for type 2 diabetes, and 
09%22 and 
59%16 for cataract, respectively
 Bivariate LDSC was utilized to estimate the genetic correlation (i
 e
, rg) between type 2 diabetes and cataract with and without a constrained intercept, which is designed to reduce the bias from population stratification
 A significant rg To explore whether type 2 diabetes had significant genetic overlap with cataract in some specific independent genomic regions, we performed -HESS11 to estimate the local genetic correlations between type 2 diabetes and cataract according to the hg19-based 1000 Genomes East Asian reference
 A total of 1,439 approximately LD-independent genomic regions (with the exclusion of the MHC region)23 were utilized in our analysis
 The regions were excluded if the estimated local single-trait heritability was negative because of the insufficient study power
 The estimated local genetic correlations were divided into four regional types: 
 the regions harboring significant type 2 diabetes-specific SNPs (i
 e
, type 2 diabetes-specific); 
 the harboring shared SNPs significantly associated with both type 2 diabetes and cataract (i

 ;    intersection); and 
 other regions (i
 e
, neither)
 Three GWAS p-value thresholds, 510-8, 110-5, and 110-3, were used to define the significant SNPs
 For these four regional types occupied by more than 10 regions, we calculated the mean and standard error of local genetic correlations within each type
 A potential causal effect of type 2 diabetes on cataract is suggested if the average local genetic correlation at type 2 diabetes-specific regions and respectively
 The opposite is true for inferring potential causal effect of cataract on type 2 diabetes
 Besides, the existence of pleiotropic effect may be implicated if there is a non-zero The causal relationship between type 2 diabetes and cataract was evaluated by six MR weighted mode model28, and the causal analysis using summary effect estimates [CAUSE]29) and one MR-equivalent latent causal variable (LCV) model
 Multiple methods were employed because they have different assumptions on horizontal pleiotropy, a term defined as the instrumental SNPs with effects on both exposure and outcome through non-causal pathways
 Horizontal pleiotropy is a potential confounding factor for inferring causality and can be divided into uncorrelated pleiotropy if the instrumental SNPs influence exposure and outcome via independent mechanisms, and correlated pleiotropy if the instrumental SNPs affect exposure and outcome through shared factors

 ;    methods are expected to effectively minimize the impact of horizontal pleiotropy31 from Among the seven methods, IVW measures the causal effect by integrating ratios of variant effects (ratio estimates) between exposure and outcome, assuming a balanced uncorrelated pleiotropy (with mean zero) and no correlated pleiotropy
 MR-Egger assumes no correlated pleiotropy and a non-zero uncorrelated pleiotropy, which adds an extra intercept compared to IVW to represent the magnitude of uncorrelated pleiotropy
 GSMR assumes the presence of uncorrelated pleiotropy and excludes such effect by outlier removal using heterogeneity in dependent instrument (HEIDI) approach
 The weighted median model assumes the proportion of pleiotropic (both uncorrelated and correlated) instrumental SNPs is less than half, and calculates the causal effect using the weighted median of the SNP ratio
 The weighted mode model greatly loosens the assumptions on uncorrelated and correlated pleiotropy and measures the causal effect only from the most frequent (the mode) SNP set with consistent effect
 At least 10 independent instrumental SNPs are required for maintaining study power using these five genome-wide significant (GWAS p-value<510-8) SNPs that are also merged with outcome GWAS, and then clumped by LD r<
05 within 1,000 kb window using PLINK version 
932 according to the reference genome of 1000 Genomes East Asian
 If the number of independent instrumental SNPs was less than 10, we selected the proxy instrumental SNPs by relaxing the exposure GWAS p-value threshold to 110-5 to maintain study power

 CAUSE29 is a method that is more powerful and sensitive to identify the causality from uncorrelated and correlated pleiotropy compared to other models
 CAUSE increases MR detection power by recruiting more approximately independent instrumental SNPs with GWAS p-value <110-3 and pruned by LD r2 <
 
 CAUSE also provides an expected log pointwise posterior density (ELPD) test to compare the overall fitness among a causal model (i
 e
, instrumental SNPs act on exposure and outcome through a causal pathway and shared factors), a sharing model (i
 e
, instrumental SNPs act on exposure and outcome only through shared factors), and a null model (i

 SMR leverages GWAS and eQTL summary statistics to explore the association between gene expression and a target disease or trait using a MR equivalent analysis
 SMR further utilizes HEIDI-outlier test to check if the significant association between gene expression and the target trait/disease is due to the causality (i

 As shown in Table 1, the estimated SNP-based liability-scale h2 for type 2 diabetes and cataract constrained LDSC intercept, suggesting the mild inflations in both diseases GWAS

 As shown in Fig
 2B, regions harboring type 2 diabetes-specific SNPs were identified with average local rg significantly higher than zero
 In reverse, regions harboring cataract-specific SNPs showed a non-significant average local rg close to zero
 Therefore, the distribution of local rg revealed by -HESS suggested a potential putative causal relationship of type 2 diabetes on cataract
 Besides, the average local rg from the intersection regions harboring shared significant SNPs with GWAS p-value<110-3 was estimated at

 Application of seven MR or MR-equivalent methods consistently detected a causal effect of detailed in Table S
 In reverse, there was no or modest evidence for a causal effect of cataract on type 2 diabetes

 3, six MR methods provided consistent evidence for a causal effect of type 2 diabetes on cataract with estimated liability-scale ORs ranging from 
07 to 
13, under the assumption of the population prevalence at 
50% of type 2 diabetes and 
09% of cataract, respectively

 ;    approximately 
06 to 
17 times of risks for developing cataract compared to healthy individuals
 Besides, LCV provided a GCP at 
87 (p-value=
5410-9), suggesting that the strong genetic correlation between type 2 diabetes and cataract can be largely explained by the causality of type 2 diabetes on cataract
 Remarkably, our putative causality of type 2 diabetes on cataract was less likely to be influenced by the horizontal pleiotropy because of the close-to-zero MR-Egger intercept (-
002, p-value =
47) and the better model fitness of causal model (with non-significant effects of correlated pleiotropy [=-

 ;    single-traits
 These genes likely play crucial roles in the casual effects of type 2 diabetes on To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the genetic correlation and explore the potential causality between type 2 diabetes and cataract specifically using East Asian population-based GWAS summary statistics
 Our results have highly enriched our current knowledge on the shared genetic architecture between type 2 diabetes and cataract
 Previously, researchers preferred to define co-occurrence of cataract and diabetes as a single outcome (i
 e
, diabetic cataract) and explored its genetics straightforwardly
 For example, Lin et al5 performed a GWAS using 758 Chinese cases with type 2 diabetic cataract and 649 healthy controls and identified 15 independent genome-wide significant SNPs, which are associated with blood sugar regulation and cataract development
 Another study37 recruited 2,501 Scottish cases and 3,032 controls and found a significant role of rs2283290 in triggering diabetic cataract
 Instead of using a single GWAS dataset with a small number of diabetic cataract patients, we leveraged large population-based GWAS summary statistics of type 2 diabetes and cataract, which is more powerful and provided robust evidence supporting the Using -HESS, we identified six genomic regions with a significant local genetic correlation between type 2 diabetes and cataract

 ;    effect of type 2 diabetes on cataract, any SNPs or genes that are located within such regions and associated with type 2 diabetes and/or cataract risks are of great interest to understand the mechanisms underlying the regions
 Therefore, we collected information from a total of 254 SNPs in ClinVar39 and genes in Malacards (supported by trustworthy sources or Cochrane based reviews40) for further analyses (Table S)
 We identified gene HNF1B (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1; Chromosome: 17: 36,046,43436,105,096) and two SNPs (i
 e
, rs121918673 within gene HNF1B) that located within the significant genomic region on chromosome 17: 34,395,06136,495,389 and reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes41, 
 In contrast, no SNPs or genes located in the -HESS estimated significant genomic regions were found to be associated with cataract risk
 Additionally, this result revealed a large proportion of shared genetics between type 2 diabetes and cataract were from the type 2 diabetes-specific regions
 These findings provided further evidence that the strong genetic correlation between type 2 diabetes and cataract is due to the type 2 diabetes-specific variants
 Application of seven MR and MR-equivalent methods provided consistent results for a causal effect of type 2 diabetes on cataract
 Our findings raise an important clinical concern in prevention and early-diagnosis of cataract in patients with type 2 diabetes
 We provided theoretical basis at genetic level for suggesting that assessing the development and severity of type 2 diabetes is likely yielding new targets for early-diagnosis of cataract, while further studies are required to pinpoint the potential aetiology underlying type 2 diabetes and cataract

 ;    We also tried to replicate our findings in the European cohort using the European indicated a non-significant genetic correlation between the two diseases according to either European or East Asian reference (see Table S)
 This result suggests the shared genetic variance between type 2 diabetes and cataract in East Asians may have strong genetic heterogeneity compared to Europeans
 Future investigations are required for a better To identify any blood-based biomarkers that may contribute to the causal effect of type 2 diabetes, we performed the multi-trait-based conditional & joint analysis (mtCOJO)44 to adjust both type 2 diabetes and cataract GWAS on each blood-based biomarker and then conducted post-mtCOJO MR analysis on adjusted type 2 diabetes and cataract GWAS (see Supplementary note, Table S7-9, and Fig
 S-)
 We found that HbA1c (i
 e
, Hemoglobin A1c) may be involved in the causality of type 2 diabetes on cataract, standing in line with previous RCTs showing the impact of glycemic control on the prevention of ocular complications-
 However, this result was possibly caused by the high genetic correlation between HbA1c and type 2 diabetes (rg=
57 and 
84 with and without constrained intercept) which may greatly decrease the heritability of type 2 diabetes and thus reduced the genetic correlation and putative causal relationship between type 2 diabetes and cataract
 Future investigations should focus on this finding with the recruitment of a larger sample size

 ;    We identified two candidate functional genes MIR4453HG and KCNK17 that are likely relevant to the genetic causality between type 2 diabetes and cataract
 Interestingly, both genes described a significant association with single-trait type 2 diabetes due to linkage (i
 e
, not passed HEIDI-outlier test), and then showed a more significant association with cross-trait type 2 diabetes and cataract due to causality or pleiotropy, further suggesting that cataract is likely an outcome triggered by the genetic mutations of type 2 diabetes
 MIR4453HG is an IncRNA gene and located nearby some risk genes that have been reported to be associated with blood protein level (gene ARFIP148) and lipoprotein cholesterol levels (gene TRIM)
 Both traits are highly relevant to the risk for type 2 diabetes50,51 and cataract52,53 
 KCNK17 encoded a protein in the family of potassium channel
 The mutation of KCNK17 may cause the abnormal opening of potassium channels and is associated with cardiovascular diseases (e
 g
, ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage)54, which are known to be involved in the susceptibility to both type 2 diabetes55 and cataract
 These results provided novel insights on the genetic mechanisms underlying the causality between type 2 diabetes and cataract
 Further wet-lab experiments were required to approve the roles of these two genes in increasing cataract risks in Our study has several limitations
 First, the heritability of cataract was tiny with an estimate less than 2%, which may bias the estimate of genetic correlation between type 2 diabetes and cataract
 Nevertheless, this effect should be negligible as the heritability of cataract is significantly different from zero
 Secondly, the number of instrumental SNPs using cataract (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    as exposure is less than 
 Instead, we selected the proxy instrumental SNPs with p-value <110-5, which may violate assumptions of some MR methods (e
 g
, GSMR)
 However, the MR effects of these MR methods are highly consistent with CAUSE, suggesting the feasible application of using the proxy instrumental SNPs
 Thirdly, due to the limitation of our statistical models, we did not investigate the genetic contributions of the MHC region on the susceptibility to co-morbid type 2 diabetes and cataract, which possibly underestimated the In summary, we provide robust evidence for a strong genetic association between type 2 diabetes and cataract, and a putative causal effect of type 2 diabetes on cataract particularly in East Asians
 Lower expression of two novel candidate genes MIR4453HG and KCNK17 were identified to be possibly involved in the causality between type 2 diabetes and cataract
 Our results provided theoretical fundament at the genetic level for improving early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of cataract in type 2 diabetes patients in clinical practice
