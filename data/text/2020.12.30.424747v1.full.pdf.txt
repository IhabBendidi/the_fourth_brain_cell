 ;    Here we report the isolation by selective breeding of two sublines of Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice exhibiting a significant difference in the incidence of autoimmune type 1 diabetes (TD)
 Whole genome sequencing of the NOD/NckH (high T1D incidence) and NOD/NckL (low T1D incidence) revealed the presence of a limited number of variants specific to each subline
 Treating the age of T1D onset as a quantitative trait and using automated meiotic mapping (AMM), enhanced susceptibility in the NOD/NckH subline was unambiguously attributed to a recessive allele of Dusp10 which encodes a dual specificity phosphatase
 The causative effect of the mutation was verified with a high level of confidence by targeting Dusp10 with CRISPR/Cas9 in NOD/NckL mice: in these animals a higher incidence of diabetes was observed
 Expression of wild-type Dusp10 correlated with higher levels of surface PD-L1 in (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    Type one diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by T lymphocytes reactive with the insulin-producing -cells of the islets of Langerhans ()
 The etiology is only partially understood though compelling data point to the involvement of both genetic and environmental factors (-)
 The disease occurs spontaneously in Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice
 The inbred strain NOD/Shi was first established in Japan in 1980 (5), and from it different colonies were established over the world, including our own in Paris, hosted at the Hpital Necker since 1986 (NOD/Nck)
  Rupture of self-tolerance in NOD mice is evident at 3 weeks of age
  Progressive infiltration of the islets of Langerhans by mononuclear cells (i
 e
 insulitis) begins at this time, eventually causing the selective destruction of -cells that precedes the advent of hyperglycemia, by 3 months of age
  By this time approximately 70% of the insulin-secreting -cell mass has been destroyed ()
 The incidence of T1D, as assessed by the advent of glycosuria and hyperglycemia, varies among the different colonies of NOD mice a feature considered to be largely but not exclusively due to differences in the breeding environment and In this study, we took advantage of a restart of our NOD/Nck colony from a single pair of mice
 In breeding the colony, we noted as we had in the past that disease incidence widely differed between litters; an observation easy to monitor because the number of pups in NOD litters often ranges from -
 The difference was more apparent in male mice whose disease incidence rarely exceeds 50% at 40 weeks of age than in females that show a higher disease incidence (-%)
 We decided to explore whether this phenotypic variation could be maintained in sublines of NOD/Nck mice generated through brother-sister breeding from litters presenting high or low T1D incidence
 We initially established 5 distinct sublines which we followed for 3 consecutive generations (Fig
 1a-b, Supp Fig a)
 We subsequently concentrated on two of these sublines showing the most significant difference in T1D incidence
 These we named NOD/NckH (for High incidence) and NOD/NckL (for Low incidence) (Figure )
 The phenotypic variation was stably maintained for over 30 generations in these 2 sublines raised in a specific pathogen free (SPF) environment, as assessed by regularly comparing T1D incidence and age of T1D onset at equivalent generations (Figure a)

 ;    Furthermore, we confirmed that the difference in T1D incidence in a group of NOD/NckH and NOD/NckL mice re-derived from embryos frozen at generation 7 was comparable to that of the autoimmune process in the NOD mouse showed a clear time-shifted difference in the kinetics of events that occurred earlier in NOD/NckH as compared to NOD/NckL mice
 This was the case for the progression of insulitis (Figure 3a) and also the enumeration of diabetogenic lymphocytes in spleen, pancreatic lymph nodes and peripheral blood assessed by interferon gamma (IFN) ELIspot and tetramer staining respectively (Figure b,c,d)
 Of note, the class I MHC tetramer complexed with the NRP mimotope (NRP-V7) that detects circulating pathogenic CD8+ T cells specific for IGRP confirmed its value as a sensitive marker to predict T1D advent in individual mice (Figure 3e) ()
 However, no intrinsic abnormality in the in vivo functional capacity of diabetogenic T lymphocytes or regulatory CD4+FoxP3+ T lymphocytes was observed using adoptive transfer (data not shown)
 Similar timing of islet antigen presentation was observed in NOD/NckH and NOD/NckL mice as assessed by a well-established method:  an identical capacity of diabetogenic cells expressing the transgenic BDC

 At generation 7 we sequenced the whole genome of four individuals of each subline to search for specific and apparently fixed genetic variation that might contribute to the phenotypic differences in T1D Sequencing data were generated to an average mapped read depth of 
4X per individual and variants were then called from the alignment against the mm10 reference genome (C57BL/6J; GRCm)
 After filtering, a total of 925 putative variants including 745 single nucleotide variants (SNVs), 146 small indels, and 34 structural variants (SVs), were identified

 ;    Only two variants were present in insulin-dependent diabetes (Idd) genetic regions, a non-coding SNV in Paqr8 and a non-synonymous missense SNV in H-Q
 Of the above-mentioned putative variants, 205 were selected for validation, 117 and 88 from the NOD/NckH and NOD/NckL sublines, respectively, affecting both coding and non-coding regions
 This validation set included 147 SNVs, 21 small indels, and 34 SVs
 118 mutations were validated in 10-15 additional individuals by Ion Torrent sequencing and used for mapping the early T1D onset phenotype observed in the NOD/NckH subline (Supplementary Table )
 Of the 118 validated variants, 31 were predicted to change coding sense, including 16 non-synonymous missense SNVs
 The remaining 15 coding variants were nonsense, stop/start loss, critical splice site mutations, large deletions or duplications, and small indel variants causing a frameshift
 Of 14 SVs that validated via Ion Torrent sequencing, only one was found to be unique to the NOD/Nck sublines, as the rest were also present in the NOD/ShiLtJ genome
 It was also the only SV to exist in a gene coding region
 Transcriptome analysis followed by qPCR validated the 
4 kb deletion on chromosome 9 overlapping with the coding region of the Rp9 gene
 Interestingly, we found that the validated coding mutations were private to either NOD/NckH or NOD/NckL sublines since they were not found in the NOD/ShiLtJ bred To identify causative mutations, we mapped the autoimmune T1D phenotype as a quantitative trait, age of T1D onset, in a large cohort of F2 hybrid mice made by crossing NOD/NckH and NOD/NckL parents and intercrossing their progeny (Figure )
 We combined this traditional breeding approach for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis with a validated method for variant genotyping (Ion Torrent sequencing using barcoded libraries) and software tool (Linkage Analyzer) to identify causative mutations present in the germline of mice concurrent with recognition of variant phenotypes ()
 The program tests the probability of single locus transmission models ()
 For this particular study, a second mode of analysis was developed in which epistatic effects of mutations at all loci were tested to identify modifications of (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    Importantly T1D incidence in F1 hybrids at 40 weeks was intermediate to that of parental F0 NOD/NckH and NOD/NckL mice (Figure a,b)
 Also, T1D incidence in F1 hybrids was similar whether the dam was from one or the other subline indicating that there was no subline-specific parental origin effect on the phenotype transmission (Figure a)
 The F2 progeny were generated from intercrosses of F1 NOD/NckH and NOD/NckL parents of the 24th generation, and included 294 males and 316 females that showed an incidence and age of onset of T1D similar to that of F1 hybrids at 40 weeks (Figure b)
  When single locus linkage analysis was performed using Linkage Analyzer the early age of T1D onset in the NOD/NckH line was mapped to a recessive missense mutation of NOD/NckH origin in Dusp10, encoding the dual specificity phosphatase 10 (DUSP10), also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 5 (MKP5) (Figure )
  Subsequently, an epistatic effect was detected indicating a dominant inhibitory effect of a non-coding polymorphism of NOD/NckL origin in progestin and adipoQ receptor family member VIII (Paqr8) on the Dusp10 variant allele (Figure )
 Importantly, cumulative T1D incidence curves in F2 mice homozygous for both variants strictly reflected the disease incidence curves in parental This Dusp10 mutation is classified as probably damaging with a Polyphen-2 score of 
998 (Figure a)
 The Dusp10 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variant (SNV) changes G to T at missense mutation at position 73 in the protein DUSP10 (Figure b)
  MAP kinase phosphatases (MKP), a family of dual-specificity (phospho-Ser/Thr and phospho-Tyr) phosphatases, are essential regulators in immune responses whose function is evolutionarily conserved
 These enzymes include three domains
  The structures of two of these are known, namely the C-terminal catalytic domain (Residues 330-462 in the M
 musculus sequence PF
20), and the central MAPK binding domain (BD, residues -280 in the M
 musculus sequence, also called Rhodanese-like domain PF00581) is involved in recognizing the target MAP kinase (16, )
 The variant we describe here is localized in an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (from residue 1 to 143, as predicted by Spot-(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    Disorder, alternation of ordered and disordered regions from residue 1 to predicted 140 by We searched and found highly conserved orthologues of Dusp10 in representatives of all vertebrate classes, including the lamprey Petromyzon marinus
 The intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain is less conserved than the central and catalytic domains; nevertheless, a stretch of residues including Cys73 (of the M
 musculus sequence) is completely conserved Zhang et al established C57BL/6 mice homozygous for a robust knockout allele of Dusp10 ()
 Dusp10-deficient cells showed increased innate immune responses; i

 production of greatly enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages upon TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation ()
 Dusp10-deficient CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells produced significantly increased levels of cytokines, which led to much more robust and rapidly fatal immune To generate a second mutant allele of Dusp10 on the NOD/NckL background we used the NOD/NckL males were microinjected to target Dusp
 We focused our attention on male CR#13 carrying modification Dusp10Y86X resulting from the random deletion of a single nucleotide generating a premature STOP codon and potentially leading to a truncated protein with loss of the kinase interaction motif and the phosphatase active site (Figure )
 To reduce the risk of potential off targets effects when generating the CR#13 subline by repeated intercrosses, we first backcrossed the founder to a particular NOD/NckL subline in which the Paqr8 polymorphism, which had never become fixed in the homozygous state by inbreeding, was wild-type
  This eliminated the dominant inhibitory effect of the Paqr8 polymorphism on the NOD/NckH Dusp10 variant allele (Figure )
 CR#13 mice carrying the homozygous putative null Dusp10Y86X mutation showed a T1D incidence similar to that of NOD/NckH and (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    significantly higher than those homozygous or heterozygous for the wild-type allele whose A fundamental issue was to address whether the difference in T1D incidence driven by the identified Dusp10 mutation resulted from an impact on the immune system, or on the target of disease (namely the pancreatic islets)
 To approach this question, we used a strategy described in our laboratory relying on the adoptive transfer of pathogenic T lymphocytes from diabetic animals into newborn syngeneic recipients within the first 3 days of life ()
 Spleen T lymphocytes from overtly diabetic NOD/NckH or NOD/NcKL were transferred into the reciprocal newborn recipients
 Results showed that NOD/NcKL recipients were less sensitive to T1D transfer than NOD/NckH recipients arguing for an impact of the Dusp10 mutation on the islets We performed a comparative transcriptome analysis of several tissues isolated from NOD/NckH and NOD/NcKL mice (Figure a,b)
 Importantly, pancreatic islets of Langerhans from NOD/NckH mice isolated at 3 weeks of age, before onset of insulitis, displayed downregulation of 27 genes compared to those in NOD/NcKL islets, including type 1 interferons (Ifnb), and various interferon signature genes (Irgm1, Irgm2, Ifi47, Ifit1, Ifit2, Ifi202b) and also Cd274 (Figure b)
 The case of Cd274, encoding Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) is particularly interesting
 The PD-1/PD-L1 axis is an important checkpoint in autoimmune diabetes as assessed by the acceleration of T1D observed in NOD mice upon injection of antibodies to PD-1 ()
 This result was validated by qPCR on islets isolated from NOD/NckH and NOD/NcKL (Figure c)
 Immunohistochemical studies in progress show that insulitis, which appears earlier in NOD/NckH mice, is only observed at early stages in islets expressing low levels of PD-L
 This is in contrast with the high PD-L1 expression observed in insulitis-Our results have three major implications
 First, we identified a single non-synonymous nucleotide change in the DUSP10 encoding gene and provide evidence that it directly affects the phenotype of a complex autoimmune disease
 Second, our data illustrate the rapidity of appearance and fixation of de novo germline mutations that can alter a complex phenotype (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    such as T1D, either exacerbating it or accelerating it
 This suggests that the T1D phenotype has a large genomic footprint
  Finally, these findings suggest a new, rapid, and far more precise approach to identifying the missing heritability of T1D and other complex autoimmune diseases, which could be achieved through a forward genetic strategy employing random This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations of European protocols were approved by the Ethical Committee of Paris Descartes University and the French Ministry of Education and Research (PROJET N 2019092612242506  V3 Mice
