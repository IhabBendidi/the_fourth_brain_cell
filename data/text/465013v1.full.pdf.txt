Low Field Magnetic Stimulation is a potentially rapid-acting treatment for depression with mood-enhancing effects in as little as one 20-minute session
 The most convincing data for LFMS has comefrom treating bipolar depression
 We examined whether LFMS also has rapid mood-enhancing effectsin treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, and whether these effects are dose-dependent
 Wehypothesized that a single 20-min session of LFMS would reduce depressive symptom severity andthat the magnitude of this change would be greater after three 20-min sessions than after a single -min session
 In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 30 participants (age 2165) with treatment-resistant depression were randomized to three 20-minute active or sham LFMS treatments with 48 hoursbetween treatments
 Response was assessed immediately following LFMS treatment using the -itemHamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-6), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) and theVisual Analog Scale
 Following the third session of LFMS, the effect of LFMS on VAS and HAMD-6 was superior to sham (F (1, 24) = 
45, p = 
03, HolmBonferroni corrected; F (1, 22) = 
,p = 
03, HolmBonferroni corrected, respectively)
 There were no differences between sham andLFMS following the initial or second session with the effect not becoming significant until after thethird session
 Three 20-minute LFMS sessions were required for active LFMS to have a mood-enhancingeffect for individuals with treatment-resistant depression
 As this effect may be transient, future workshould address dosing schedules of longer treatment course as well as biomarker-based targeting ofnot certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    two-thirds of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) not achieving remission afterthe first trial of antidepressant medications and one-third of patients remaining symptomaticfollowing multiple sequential trials of antidepressant medication []
 Other patients are unableto tolerate antidepressant medications [2, ]
 Although treatments such as electroconvulsivetherapy (ECT) are highly efficacious [46], tolerability of ECT can be low due to potentialcognitive side effects []
 Newer magnetic stimulation treatments such as repetitive transcranialmagnetic stimulation (rTMS) have shown clinical efficacy, reproduced in meta-analyses [],and have a better side effect profile than ECT and many medications
 However, the standardrTMS treatment protocol requires daily 40-minute sessions, continuously for 46 weeks, andLow field magnetic stimulation may offer an alternative to patients who do not remit withtraditional pharmacologic approaches
 LFMS employs the unique magnetic field waveform usedin echo-planar magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging to deliver a low intensity, time-varyingelectric field in the brain (E  1V/m, 1 kHz)
 Unlike TMS, LFMS does not evoke neuronalaction potentials, but has been shown to modulate metabolism in broad regions of humancerebral cortex [11], and to modulate spontaneous neuronal oscillations in rodent slice prepa-rations [12, ]
 LFMS also had significant antidepressant-like behavioral effects in a rodentmodel, reducing immobility in a forced swim test protocol []
 However, mood enhancementhas been equivocal in humans with MDD, with recent single and multi-site randomized controlledtrials missing targets on their primary outcome variables, while showing some positive resultson select secondary outcomes [15, ]
 This is in contrast to somewhat more consistent positivemood-enhancing results for bipolar depression [16, ]
 LFMS may have safety advantages overTMS that could broaden its clinical applicability
 Because it is subthreshold, it does not requireperiodic monitoring of motor threshold
 Therefore, it is likely to be better tolerated than TMS,carry a lower seizure risk, and thus could potentially be administered in an unsupervised setting
The main objectives of this study were to examine the mood effects of LFMS on patients withTRD and to explore dosing in terms of number of treatment sessions
 To this end, we undertook adouble-blind randomized controlled trial of 3 sessions of LFMS for TRD
 We hypothesized thatrelative to participants randomized to the sham condition, measures of mood would be greater innot certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 LFMS treatments were delivered with a prototype LFMS device manufactured byTal Medical (Boston, MA)
 LFMS sessions consisted of a head coil and pulse sequence as usedin proton echo-planar magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging and were 20 min in duration
LFMS exposes participants to magnetic fields of the same magnitude and frequency used inclinical MR-Spectroscopic imaging of the brain
 Sham LFMS consisted of a three-dimensionalspoiled gradient echo sequence of the same duration as active LFMS and which provided auditoryAt the beginning of a treatment session, the participant lay on a flat, padded table andpositioned his head within the open bore of the LFMS device such that his superior orbitalridge aligned with the opening of the bore

 To examine whether mood ratings differed betweenactive and sham LFMS at the conclusion of treatment, we conducted three ANCOVAs (analysesof covariance), with intervention (active, sham) as a between-participants factor and age, sex andbaseline mood rating as covariates
 The three dependent variables were scores for the primaryoutcome variables (HAMD-6, PANAS-Negative, and VAS) post-intervention

Additionally, to address dosing, we asked how early in the course of treatment significant dif-ferences emerge between the mood effects of active LFMS and sham
 We conducted ANCOVAswith intervention (active, sham) as a between-participants factor and age, sex and baseline moodrating as covariates
 The dependent variables were mood scores (HAMD-6, PANAS-Negative, andVAS) during the two mid-intervention (following the second LFMS session) assessment points
Among these tests, the mid-treatment differences between active LFMS and sham did not reachsignificance on HAMD-6, PANAS-Negative, or VAS after correcting for multiple comparisons
For the 24 participants who completed a questionnaire about whether they believed they werein the active LFMS or sham condition, participants were not more likely than chance to correctlyidentify the intervention condition they were blind to (2 =

 ;    require more treatments than bipolar depression for a similar response
 This is in keeping withbipolar depression responding faster than unipolar depression to ECT [29, ]
Mood enhancements were unlikely to be attributable to sham because of the high quality of theshamparticipants from active and sham groups guessed that they received active treatment atchance
 Additionally, the mood-enhancing effect of the sham waned with subsequent treatments,an effect observed in other double-blinded, sham-controlled trials of brain stimulation treatments,The main limitation of our study is the lack of follow-up mood assessments and the shortduration between treatment completion and participant assessments
 This leaves open the possi-bility that the mood-enhancing effects reported here are highly transient, perhaps waning withinhours
 However, the mood enhancing effects observed here for TRD warrant further investigationthat includes follow-up assessments to examine durability
 Further, an enhanced dosing studyof LFMS for TRD, to elucidate the number of sessions required to demonstrate durable moodimprovements is required
 If LFMS were shown to have more sustained effects using such aprotocol, it would be of significant clinical value as this treatment could be delivered with reducedIn addition to the limited mood assessment window, the use of the HAMD-6, althoughconsistent with previous studies of LFMS, was a limitation of this study because of the timeframe it refers to
 Although we changed the time frame from 7 days to 48 hrs, the HAMD hasstill been validated only for the 7-day time period and this may have been a less appropriateassessment than the VAS or PANAS to capture transient effects on mood
In summary, LFMS may be a promising, well-tolerated treatment for TRD with a potentiallyrapid onset of action
 In addition to optimizing the dosing protocol and testing the durability ofthe mood improvments, we need to better characterize the subgroup of patients who respond toLFMS
 Using functional neuroimaging to understand the circuit abnormalities that are predictiveof treatment response has shown great promise for TMS []
 Mapping these abnormalitiesin LFMS responders could eventually help match the treatment to depressed patients most likelyto benefit and will guide advancements in LFMS coil design to optimize treatment [39, ]
