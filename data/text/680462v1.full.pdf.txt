 A hallmark feature of aging is the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass 47 and function that can progress to sarcopenia, which is associated with significant morbidity, 48 mortality, and substantial healthcare costs (Kim and Choi, 2013; Sousa et al, )
 49 Exercise is considered a front line modality to combat age-related muscle decline (Costford 50 et al, )
 However, nutritional strategies may also offer an effective countermeasure to 51 age-associated morbidities and promote healthy muscle aging (Bogan and Brenner, )

 As well as its classical role in redox metabolism, NADsuch as sirtuins, poly-ADPribose polymerases (PARPs), and cyclic ADPribose synthetases 55 that regulate key cellular processes of energy metabolism, DNA damage repair, and calcium 56 Brenner, 2004; Trammell et al, 2016) has emerged as a potential strategy to augment 59 Lavery, )
 A range of physiological stresses associated with depletion of NADNADPH have been ameliorated with NR supplementation in mice including prevention of 62 noise-induced hearing loss (Brown et al, 2014), resistance to weight gain (Cant et al, 63 2012), reduction of blood glucose, hepatic steatosis, and neuropathy on high fat diet 64 (Trammell et al 2016), improvement of cardiac function in genetic cardiomyopathy (Diguet et 65 al, 2018), and prevention of cortical neuronal degeneration (Vaur et al, )

 Thus, whether oral NR can augment the human skeletal muscle NAD availability and signalling appears to occur as part of the aging process in 74 many species (Gomes et al, 2013; Mouchiroud et al, 2013), though there is a paucity of 75 data to confirm that this is the case in human aging
 NR and nicotinamide mononucleotide 76 (NMN) are reported to extend life span (Zhang et al, 2016) and enhance metabolism in 77 aged mice (Mills et al, )
 To date, NR supplementation studies in humans have been 78 reported, focussing on cardiovascular (Martens et al, 2018), systemic metabolic (Dollerup et 79 al, 2018), and safety (Conze et al, 2019) end-points, but have not addressed advanced 80 aging, tissue metabolomic changes, or effects on muscle metabolism and function
  81 Herein, we set out to study if oral NR is available to aged human skeletal muscle and 82 whether potential effects on muscle metabolism can be detected
 We conducted a 21-day 83 NR supplementation intervention in a cohort of 70  80 year old men in a randomized, 84 double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial We demonstrate that NR augments the 85 downregulation of energy metabolism pathways, but without affecting muscle mitochondrial 87  decline is not associated with chronological aging per se in 90 not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 NR was well tolerated 106 and screening for a range of haematological and clinical biochemistry safety parameters 107 (including renal, liver and thyroid functions), revealed no adverse effects (Suppl Table )
 108 No clinical adverse events were reported during the intervention in either phase

 However remarkably, we detected 5-fold increases in 129 the products of NAM methylation clearance pathways; N-methyl nicotinamide (MeNAM; NR 130

  134 In the blood, we measured 15 metabolites from each participant at baseline and following 135 each of the NR, placebo, and washout periods (Figure 1, Suppl Figure 2B, and Suppl 136 Table )
 NR was also detectable in the blood but was not increased compared to placebo at 137 14 h after the last dose of NR (NR

 This is expected 138 as the predicated Cmax for NR is approximately 3 h (Airhart et al, )

 Furthermore, a near 20-fold increase in nicotinic acid riboside (NAR; NR-151

 152 This observation may support the suggestion that NR supplementation leads to  retrograde 153 production of NAAD, nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN), and NAR (Trammell et al 154 )
 However, direct NR transformation into NAR cannot be excluded
 Unlike muscle and 155 blood, NAM was elevated in the urine

 158 The data indicate that oral NR greatly boosts the blood NADOral NR results in downregulation of gene sets associated with energy metabolism in 163 We next assessed NR-mediated transcriptional changes in skeletal muscle
 RNA 165 sequencing followed by differential gene expression (DGE) analysis of muscle biopsies from 166 the 12 participants revealed 690 upregulated and 398 downregulated genes between 167 baseline and NR supplementation at p value <

 This is consistent with the recent discovery that oral NR depresses 175 mitochondrial membrane potential while improving blood stem cell production in mice 176 Pathways upregulated upon NR supplementation prominently belonged to gene ontology 178 categories such as cell adhesion, actin cytoskeleton organization, and cell motility (Figure 179 riboside kinase 2b (Nrk2b) in zebrafish skeletal muscle cell adhesion (Goody et al, )
 181 We next examined all the genes that belonged to the glycolysis, mitochondrial and the TCA 182 cycle pathways and found that they were predominantly downregulated following NR 183 supplementation, whereas 10 control genes sets, of the same size and expression level 184 were not (Figure 2D-F and Suppl Figure A)
 Similarly, we found that the genes belonging 185 to the gene ontology terms actin filament-based process, cell motility, and biological cell 186 adhesion, were mainly upregulated upon NR supplementation (Suppl Figure 3B and C)
  187 In agreement with DGE analysis, quantitative real time PCR showed downregulation of 188 selected genes involved in energy metabolism (Figure G)
 We found no changes in the 189 (Figure H)
 We also verified some of the upregulated targets by quantitative PCR (Suppl 191 Figure 3D), and undertook some immunoblotting validation (Suppl Figure D)
 192 As it has previously been shown that NR increases glycolysis in mouse cardiac cells (Diguet 193 et al, 2018), and because our data do not support an NR-mediated transcriptional 194 upregulation of glycolysis related genes, we examined protein expression levels of glycolytic 195 enzymes in our muscle biopsies and show them to be unchanged after NR (Figure I)

 Therefore, we undertook detailed assessment of muscle 204 respirometry, the gold standard method for the ex vivo assessment of mitochondrial function
 206 No differences were detected between NR and placebo groups in skeletal muscle complex I- 207 and complex II-mediated oxidative phosphorylation and maximal respiratory capacity, with 208 (Figure 3A) and without the prior addition of the fatty acid conjugate octanoyl-carnitine 209 (Figure B)
 In line with this, the activity of citrate synthase, commonly used as a 210 quantitative measure of mitochondrial content (Larsen et al, 2012) (Figure 3C), and 211 mitochondrial copy number (mtDNA) (Phielix et al, 2008) (Figure 3D) were unchanged by 212 NR supplementation

 Hand-grip strength 221 correlates with leg strength, and is used for the diagnosis of sarcopenia and frailty, and is a 222 better predictor for clinical outcomes than low muscle mass (Lauretani et al, )
 A 223 decline in hand-grip strength is observed after the third decade of life (when median peak 224 strength is 51 kg of force in men) (Dodds et al, 2014), dropping to median of

 Data for participants at baseline and following NR or placebo are 241 reported in Suppl Table 
 There were no changes in body weight, blood pressure, lipid 242 profile, fasting glucose and insulin (Suppl Table 1), and HOMA-IR (Figure A)
 A rebound 243 increase in non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) has previously been associated with the 244 nicotinic acid analog, acipimox (van de Weijer et al, 2015), however, NR did not produce 245 this effect in our trial (Figure B)
 Glucose handling was studied using an oral glucose 246 tolerance test with no effect of NR measured in glucose levels during the 2-hour test (Figure 247 C)
 Following the oral glucose load and the consequent insulin stimulation, NEFA levels 248 were appropriately suppressed and no difference in this response was observed between 249 NR and placebo (Figure D)
 We also assessed metabolic flexibility using indirect 250 calorimetry to derive respiratory exchange ratios (RER; calculated as VCO2 expired/ VO2 251 consumed) reflecting whole body metabolic substrate use

 Therefore, we used venous occlusive plethysmography to test forearm muscle 262 blood flow in the participants in a non-invasive manner (Greenfield, Whitney and Mowbray, 263 )
 At fasting, no NR-mediated differences were detected in muscle blood
 Following oral 264 glucose load, muscle blood flow gradually increases, but again with no differences between 265 We then used the arteriovenous difference method (see methods section) to compare 267 substrate utilisation across the forearm muscle (between arterial blood supplying the muscle 268 and venous blood drained from the muscle), with muscle blood flow taken into consideration 269 (Bickerton et al, )
 No differences were detected in O2 consumption (Figure 5B) and 270 CO2 production (Figure 5C) between NR and placebo at the fasting state and in response to 271 oral glucose
 Muscle glucose uptake was increased following oral glucose before gradual 272 decline
 Similar to blood glucose, no changes were observed in muscle glucose handling 273 with or without NR (Figure C)
 Oral glucose reduced lactate production from muscle, again 274 without a difference in response between NR and placebo (Figure E)

 We hypothesized that NR 284 supplementation would reduce the levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines
 We 285 measured multiple inflammatory cytokines (see methods section for details), 10 of which 286 were within the assay detection range (Figure )
 NR significantly decreased the levels of 287 the interleukins IL-6 (Figure 6A), IL-5 (Figure 6B), and IL-2 (Figure 6C), and tumor necrosis 288 factor-alpha (TNF-a) (Figure 6D) compared to baseline
 We detected a statistically 289 significant difference in the levels of IL-2 between baseline and placebo (Figure 6C), and 290 lack of a difference in levels of TNF-a between NR and placebo despite a difference 291 between NR and baseline (Figure D)
 This is seemingly due to NR carry-over effect 292 beyond the washout period, as evident by period effect analysis (Suppl Figure 5A - D), 293 confirming that the cohort randomized to placebo first had no difference in IL-2 between 294 baseline and placebo (Suppl Figure 5C) and there was a difference in TNF-a between NR 295 and placebo (Suppl Figure D)
 No NR-mediated changes were detected in the serum 296 levels of IL-12 (Figure 6E), IL-8 (Figure 6F), interferon-gamma (IFN-g) (Figure 6G), 297 protein-1 beta (MIP-1B) (Figure 6I), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (Figure 299 J)
 Thus, it will be interesting to further investigate depressed IL-6, IL-5, IL-2 and TNF-a as 300 biomarkers and/or mediators of oral NR in rodent models and humans

 Of note, expression of the 394 -consuming enzyme CD38 increases in inflammatory cells with inflammation (Amici et 395 al, 2018), as well as in the blood of aged humans (Polzonetti et al, )
 Supplementing 396  in this context may be a mechanism mediating the NR-induced anti-inflammatory 397 effects
 Though chronic inflammation is a hallmark feature of aging (Singh and Newman, 398 2011), use of NR may yet find utility in other chronic inflammatory disorders such as chronic 399 obstructive pulmonary disease or rheumatoid arthritis and is worthy of further investigation

 Sequencing libraries were prepared using RNA (RIN >7) with the Lexogen Quantseq3 FWD kit
 Libraries were sequenced using HiSeq2000 across 4 flowcells generating 75bp long single ended reads (average read depth of 6-10M/sample, which is higher than the 4M reads / sample required for analysis for this type of library)
 All samples were prepared and sequenced as a single pool
 Trimmomatic software (v

sh script (Bbmap suite) were used to trim the ILLUMINA adapters, polyA tails and low quality bases from reads
 Trimmed reads were then uniquely aligned to the human genome (hg38) using STAR with default settings (v

 Mapped reads were quantified using HT-expression was obtained using DEseq2 with paired baseline and treatment samples
  In this analysis we did not use a cutoff to remove lowly expressed genes
 Inclusion of lowly expressed genes (at arbitrary cut-offs) had little bearing on our results (
8% of differentially expressed genes at p < 
05 were identical between no cutoff, and a cut-off of > )
 Of note, volcano plot was drawn with a cut-off (>3) in order to visualise the typical V shape using R
 Differentially expressed genes between baseline (control) and NR treated samples at p-value = <
05 were annotated using Biological processes (BP) gene sets with DAVID tool (Huang, Brad T Sherman, and Lempicki 2009; Huang, Brad T
 Sherman, and Lempicki )
 We obtained similar results using gene annotation tool within Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) suite (Liberzon et al 2015; Subramanian et al 2005)  for gene sets from In addition, we have used GSEA analysis tool to interrogate specific gene sets against our pre-ranked expression data (Control vs NR treatment)
