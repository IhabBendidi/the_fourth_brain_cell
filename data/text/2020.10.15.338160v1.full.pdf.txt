 Insulin receptor (Insr) protein can be found at higher levels in pancreatic -cells than in most other cell types, but the consequences of -cell insulin resistance remain enigmatic
 Ins1cre allele was used to delete Insr specifically in -cells of both female and male mice which were compared to Inscre-containing littermate controls at multiple ages and on multiple diets
 RNA-seq of recombined -cells revealed significant differences in multiple pathways previously implicated in insulin secretion and cellular fate, including rewired Ras and NFKB signaling
 Male, but not female, InsrKO mice had reduced oxygen consumption rate, while action potential and calcium oscillation frequencies were increased in Insr knockout -cells from female, but not male mice
 Female InsrKO and InsrHET mice exhibited elevated insulin release in perifusion experiments, during hyperglycemic clamps, and following i
 p
 glucose challenge
 Deletion of Insr did not reduce -cell mass up to 9 months of age, nor did it impair hyperglycemia-induced proliferation
 Based on our data, we adapted a mathematical model to include -cell insulin resistance, which predicted that -cell Insr knockout would improve glucose tolerance depending on the degree of whole-body insulin resistance
 Indeed, glucose tolerance was significantly improved in female InsrKO and InsrHET mice when compared to controls at 9, 21 and 39 weeks
 We did not observe improved glucose tolerance in adult male mice or in high fat diet-fed mice, corroborating the prediction that global insulin resistance obscures the effects of -cell specific insulin resistance
 We further validated our in vivo findings using the Ins1-CreERT transgenic line and found improved glucose tolerance 4 weeks after tamoxifen-mediated Insr deletion
 Collectively, our data show that loss of -cell Insr alone is sufficient to drive glucose-induced hyperinsulinemia, thereby improving glucose homeostasis in otherwise insulin sensitive dietary and Type 2 diabetes is a multifactorial disease wherein several cell types, most prominently pancreatic -cells, are dysfunctional prior to and after diagnosis (Prentki and Nolan, )
 Hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance can all be observed prior to the onset of frank diabetes (Tabak et al, 2012), but the causal relationships between these factors remain incompletely understood (Page and Johnson, )
 Impaired insulin receptor signaling is associated with obesity and often precedes the onset of overt type 2 diabetes, but it has been studied primarily in skeletal muscle, fat, and liver where it manifests differently (Boucher et al, )
 Recent work in mice has established that -cell specific insulin resistance can be observed early in the progression towards type 2 diabetes, when hyperinsulinemia is prominent, and independently of insulin resistance in other tissues (Paschen et al, )
 The physiological consequences of reduced It remains unresolved whether physiological insulin action on -cells manifests as positive feedback to stimulate further insulin secretion, or negative feedback to inhibit its own release (Leibiger et al, )
 Human studies provide evidence for both possibilities
 In vivo hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps have been shown to reduce circulating C-peptide, a marker of endogenous insulin secretion (Cavallo-Perin et al, 1993; Elahi et al, )
 In some studies, this inhibition was impaired in the obese state suggesting that systemic insulin resistance also extends to the -cells (Cavallo-Perin et al, )
 Bouche and colleagues replicated this result at basal glucose, but also found evidence that insulin can potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion under specific conditions (Bouche et al, )
 Others have shown that insulin can either stimulate or inhibit its own secretion depending on the metabolic context (Mari et al, )
 Administration of insulin to single -cells in vitro increases intracellular Ca2+ (Johnson and Misler, 2002a) and, in some studies, stimulates exocytosis (Aspinwall et al, )
 However, Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is not always sufficient to evoke insulin exocytosis
 We previously did not detect robust exocytosis or C-peptide release from human -cells in response to exogenous insulin despite observed changes in Ca2+ release (Luciani and Johnson, Whether chronic changes in autocrine insulin signaling affect -cell development, survival and adaptation conditions is also controversial Mice with chronically reduced insulin production have (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    impaired -cell expansion in the context of a high fat diet (Mehran et al, )
 In vitro, physiologically relevant concentrations of insulin support the survival of both human and mouse -cells (Johnson et al, a)
 We also reported insulin is sufficient to increase proliferation of cultured primary mouse -cells and that blocking insulin secretion with somatostatin blunts proliferation induced by hyperglycemia in vitro (Beith et al, 2008) and that the majority of glucose-dependent changes in gene expression in MIN6 cells are Insr-dependent (Ohsugi et al, )
 However, it has also been proposed hyperglycemia-induced -cell proliferation bypasses the Insr (Jhala et al, 2003; Stamateris et al, )
 Thus, whether these signals from insulin and/or glucose are transmitted through Insr, To address the short- and long-term consequences of eliminating Insr signaling in vivo, Kulkarni and colleagues generated mice with a floxed Insr allele and an Ins2 promoter driven Cre transgene (Kulkarni et al, )
 Using this and related models, they reported that mice lacking -cell Insr have profound glucose intolerance, and frank diabetes in some cases, due to impaired glucose stimulated insulin secretion, Glut2 loss, and insufficient -cell mass (Kulkarni et al, 1999; Okada et al, 2007; Otani et al, )
 Mice lacking Insr in -cells (and other off-target cell types) failed to exhibit the compensatory increase in -cell mass that accompanies a high fat diet in mice (Okada et al, )
 Doubt was cast on some of these results when these Cre lines were subsequently shown to have off-target tissue effects owing to endogenous Ins2 expression in the brain and thymus (Fan et al, 2009; Johnson, 2014; Mehran et al, 2012; Wicksteed et al, a)
 More recently, Wang and colleagues studied the roles of -cell Insr in utero and in adult mice using an inducible Ins1-CreER transgenic mouse model (Oakie et al, 2020; Wang et al, 2018), but these studies are confounded by the presence of the human growth hormone (hGH) minigene (Oropeza et al, 2015), which necessitates In the present study, we used the constitutive Ins1Cre knock-in strain with robust and specific recombination in -cells (Thorens et al, 2015) to precisely reduce insulin receptor signaling and define the impacts of -cell specific insulin resistance on glucose homeostasis
 Using this approach, we found that insulin receptor signaling plays a suppressive role on insulin secretion by modulating -cell electrical excitability and that this effect is absent in conditions of global insulin resistance
 We initiated our studies by conducting an unbiased analysis of insulin receptor abundance across tissues using publicly accessible data
 Pancreatic islets had the 2nd highest protein abundance of both isoforms of the insulin receptor across a panel of 24 human tissues, as quantified by mass-spectrometry (Fig
 A)
 These results, which are not complicated by the limitations associated with anti-insr antibodies, show that islets have more INSR protein than classical insulin target tissues, including the liver and adipose
 This also supports our previous observations suggesting that insulin receptors are more abundant in -cells relative to other cells in the pancreas (Boothe et al, )
 Compilation of open source public single-cell RNA sequencing data from human islets demonstrated at least one count of insulin receptor mRNA in 
4% -cells, alongside other islet cell types (Fig
 We next sought to examine the function of the Insr, and the consequences of -cell-specific insulin resistance/sensitivity, using an in vivo -cell specific knockout mouse model
 To limit recombination of the floxed Insr allele to pancreatic -cells, we used a Cre allele knocked into the endogenous Ins1 locus which, unlike Ins2 promoters, drives specific expression in -cells (Thorens et al, )
 control Insrwt/wt;Ins1cre/wt;nTnG mice were generated using a breeding scheme to ensure consistency of the Cre donor parent (Fig
 C)
 Cre-recombinase efficiency was assessed using the nuclear TdTomato-to-nuclear EGFP (nTnG) lineage trace reporter (Prigge et al, 2013) and found to be robust on the Insrf/f;Ins1cre/wt;nTnG genetic background (Fig D)
 We confirmed by Western blotting that Insr protein was almost completely absent from InsrKO islets and partially reduced from InsrHET (Fig
 E)
 qPCR showed that Insr mRNA was not decreased in any of the 18 tissues examined, including the whole brain or hypothalamus specifically, hence we did not perform Western blots for other tissues (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    (Fig
 F)
 Together with other published data on Ins1cre mice, these data strongly suggest that Insr deletion with Ins1cre is robust and sufficiently specific to pancreatic -cells
 To establish a baseline gene expression profile of our -cell specific Insr knockout model we performed an unbiased global analysis of -cell gene expression in FACS purified GFP-positive -cells labelled with the nTnG reporter (Fig
 SA)
 RNA sequencing revealed significant differences in mRNA expression between InsrKO -cells and wild type -cells (Fig
 2; Fig
 SB-E)
 Overall, differentially expressed genes were enriched in Reactome pathways related to NFB signaling, Ras signaling, and mRNA splicing (Fig
 SB)
 In many cases, Insr gene deletion showed a gene-dose-dependent effect on regulated gene expression meaning that heterozygous InsrHET -cells exhibited intermediate expression of target genes between the full Insr knockout and wildtype -cells (Fig
 SC)
 Significantly upregulated individual mRNAs in InsrKO mice included genes that promote insulin secretion (Jak2, Atp6ap2), mediate cell death (Tmem123, Dusp26, Rela) and mitochondria fragmentation (Cers6), and repress -cell maturity (Dusp26) and proliferation (Rela, Kras), or participate in islet development (Tm4sf4)(Anderson et al, 2011; Chamberlain et al, 2014; Dai et al, 2015; Gomez-Banoy et al, 2019; Ma et al, 2001; Mandrup-Poulsen, 2003; Zhang et al, )
 Several of the upregulated individual genes have been reported to be significantly associated with glycemic or obesity traits in human GWAS studies, including Utp3, Rela, Cers6, Rnf6, and Tbce (Fig
 S1C; www
 typediabetesgenetics
 org)
 Collectively, these upregulated genes point to -cells that may be hyper-secretory, but are perhaps more susceptible to some stress conditions
 Individual genes that were significantly decreased included regulators of -cell function, including the regulation of KATP channels, and -cell fate (Brsk2, Rab3a, Bmpr2, Camk2b, Mapk8ip3), a negative regulator of Glut2 protein abundance (Prnp), a regulator of endocytosis (Vps8), a mediator of autophagy and cellular cholesterol traffic (Gramd1a), an anti-apoptosis gene (Rel), a transducer of ER stress (Atf6b), and a histone methyltransferase and STAT target gene (Mettl8)(Ashok and Singh, 2018; Engin et al, 2013; Fornoni et al, 2008; Frau et al, 2017; Goulley et al, 2007; Gu et al, 2018; Kline et al, 2013; Laraia et al, 2019; Locke et al, 2015; Mokhtari et al, 2009; Tobi et al, 2018; Wang et al, 2005; Yaekura et al, 2003; Yang et al, 2015; Zhang et al, )
 Several of these downregulated genes showed strong evidence for genome-wide association with glycemic traits, including Ttll12, C2, Atf6b, Sympk, and Camk2b (Fig
 SC)
 Interestingly, Ddx31 is a genetic regulator of circulating proinsulin levels in women but not men (Strawbridge et al, )
 Hnf4g belongs to a network of transcription factors that play essential roles in -cell function and fate but its specific role is unclear (Hara et al, )
 Together, analysis of upregulated and downregulated genes points to the possibility that -cells lacking Insr may exhibit increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion but We also used unbiased protein-protein interaction network analysis to examine the relationships between the differentially expressed genes, as well as known components of the insulin signaling pathways
 We identified key network hubs downstream of -cell Insr (Fig
 SD)
 We also predicted the factors Rel, Pygo2, Polr2a, Nanos1 were significantly decreased and Jak2, Thap3 significantly increased in Insr-deficient -cells
 These are likely to be the more proximal mediators of the Insr-The RNA-seq analysis of Insr-regulated genes implicated multiple factors known to promote insulin secretion, including regulators of Glut2, mitochondria, KATP channels, and granule trafficking
 We did not observe significant differences in the intensity or gross localization of Glut2 protein using immunofluorescence imaging (Fig
 A,B)
 We examined mitochondrial function using the Seahorse bioanalyzer and found no significant differences between groups in females
 In males, we observed a significant reduced oxygen consumption rate in dispersed islets from both InsrKO and InsrHET in comparison to controls during basal respiration and after antimycin A/rotenone injections, suggesting reduced ATP production (Fig
 C)
 Insulin administration has been reported to open -cell KATP channels, mediating negative feedback on insulin secretion (Khan et al, )
 Lack of this endogenous insulin action through Insr would therefore be expected to lead to -cell hyper-excitability in our mouse model in the context of high glucose

 ;    cells from female InsrKO mice confirmed a significant increase in action potential firing frequency during glucose stimulation, when compared to control -cells, with no differences in resting potential, firing threshold, or action potential height (Fig
 D,E)
 The reversal potential was right-shifted in InsrKO -cells, further suggesting reduced K+ conductance (Fig
 G)
 Interestingly, the hyper-excitability was observed in Insr knockout -cells from female, but not male mice (Fig
 E,F)
 Perhaps the reduced mitochondrial efficiency in males prevented -cell hyperexcitability
 It is also possible that male control -cells were already maximally insulin resistant when studied
 No significant differences have been identified in Insr mRNA expression between sorted -cells from female and male islets (Stancill et al, )
 We did not observe a statistically significant difference in depolarization induced exocytosis in single cells from either sex (Fig
 3H), suggesting that the late stages of insulin granule exocytosis are Next, we analyzed Ca2+ responses to 15mM glucose in thousands of Fura-2-loaded dispersed islet cells and analyzed the data with an adaptation of our TraceCluster algorithm (Wills et al, )
 In agreement with the electrophysiological data, Insr knockout -cells from female mice exhibited a significantly greater number of oscillation peaks within the glucose stimulation period compared to control cells (Fig
 3I,J, S)
 A similar increase in excitability was observed in InsrHET -cells
 Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that -cells lacking Insr have increased electrical activity, suggesting that insulin has a negative feedback influence on excitability in the context of Loss of -cell Insr causes insulin hypersecretion in the context of stimulatory glucose Insulin secretion is driven by electrical excitability, so we next carefully examined the effects of partial and full -cell Insr deletion on secretory function employing multiple orthogonal in vitro and in vivo assays
 We used islet perifusion to examine the dynamics of insulin secretion ex vivo at rest (3 mM glucose) and in response to 20mM glucose or 10mM glucose, as well as direct depolarization with 30mM KCl
 Islets from female 16 week-old InsrKO and InsrHET mice secreted more insulin in response to 20 mM glucose and 30 mM KCl compared to islets from control mice (Fig
 A)
 No significant differences were observed at 3mM or 10mM glucose (Fig
 A)
 Consistent with our electrophysiology data, we did not observe differences in islets from males of the same age and on the same diet (Fig
 B)
 It seems possible that reduced ATP generation in male mice (Fig
 4C) offsets any enhanced excitability/Ca2+ responsiveness, to result in absence of significant changes in insulin This potentiation of high glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ex vivo in the complete and partial Insr knockout -cells, led us to examine how insulin levels were affected by glucose stimulation in vivo using the hyperglycemic clamp technique in awake mice
 For this cohort of mice, there were no significant differences in body mass (control 
5 +/- 
5g n=8 vs InsrKO 
8 +/- 
4g n=10), lean mass (control 
5 +/- 
4g vs InsrKO 
3 +/- 
2g), or fat mass (control 
8 +/- 
3g vs InsrKO 
2 +/- 
 g)
 Glucose infusion rates were adjusted in order to reach hyperglycemic levels (~19 mM) in InsrKO and wild type control mice (Fig
 4C, D, G, H)
 Interestingly, slightly higher glucose infusion rates were necessary in female InsrKO mice in comparison to control mice in order to reach similar hyperglycemic levels (Fig
 C)
 In accordance with our ex vivo insulin secretion data, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was higher in female, but not in male InsrKO mice compared with control mice (Fig
 4E, I)
 We further tested whether in vivo insulin secretion would be potentiated after a single bolus of glucose in mice with reduced -cell Insr
 At 11 weeks of age, plasma insulin response, relative to baseline, was significantly elevated 30 min after i
 p
 injection of 2g/kg body mass glucose in female, but not in male, InsrKO mice compared to controls (Fig
 4K, L)
 In accordance with the electrophysiology, Ca2+ oscillation, and islet perifusion data, we detected no statistical difference between female genotypes in fasting plasma insulin in vivo at multiple ages (Fig
 S)
 Together, these experiments suggest that -cell Insr can play suppressive role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion Effects of -cell Insr loss on insulin production, storage, processing and clearance  Insulin and insulin signaling can modulate protein synthesis in many cell types and we have previously provided evidence that soluble cellular insulin protein transiently increases in human islet cell cultures treated with exogenous insulin (Luciani and Johnson, )
 To assess the quantitative contribution of Insr signaling to insulin production and mRNA translation rates we measured total islet (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    insulin content after acid-ethanol extraction and examined total protein synthesis rate using S35- methoioine/cysteine pulse labelling in isolated islets
 Total insulin content and protein synthesis in isolated islets were unaffected by Insr deletion under these basal glucose conditions (Fig
 M-P)
 To investigate the role of Insr signaling on -cell stress and insulin clearance, we conducted analysis of plasma proinsulin to C-peptide ratios, and C-peptide to insulin ratios in the fasting state (4h) across multiple ages in both male and female mice, and on multiple diets (Fig
 S)
 While many of these parameters changed with age, no statistical differences between genotypes was seen in any of these parameters of mice fed either a low-fat diet (LFD) or a high fat diet (HFD)
 A trend towards lower insulin clearance was observed in LFD-fed female InsrKO mice in comparison to wild type control mice at 7 weeks
 Collectively, these experiments show that -cell insulin receptor signaling has only a small, if any, effect on insulin processing and clearance at baseline glucose conditions
 As our RNA sequencing data revealed pathways downstream of Insr signaling that may affect -cell proliferation capacity (Fig
 2), we examined baseline -cell area and proliferation reserve capacity
 Islet architecture and -cell-to--cell ratio were not obviously perturbed (Fig
 A)
 We did not detect significant differences associated with genotype in -cell area in either female or male mice, at 13, 42 weeks (LFD) or 54 weeks (HFD) of age (Fig
 B)
 In comparison to control mice, HFD fed female InsrKO mice had a tendency toward a smaller -cell area at 54 weeks of age that were consistent with tendencies towards lower plasma insulin (Fig
 S3C), proinsulin and C-peptide levels (Fig
 S)
 These data suggest that Insr may help support age-dependent -cell expansion under some conditions
 Prolonged hyperglycemia can stimulate -cell proliferation in adult mouse -cells (Sharma et al, 2015), but whether this requires intact insulin receptor signaling remains controversial To examine the role of Insr-mediated signaling on hyperglycemia-induced -cell proliferation, we performed 4-day hyperglycemic infusions in InsrKO and wild type control mice
 In female mice, hyperglycemia (>10 mM; Fig
 5F) resulted in mildly elevated insulin secretion in InsrKO relative to control mice for the initial 48 h, which was not sustained for the duration of the experiment (Fig
 5G,H), while glucagon levels declined similarly in both genotypes (Fig
 I,J)
 There was no effect of Insr deletion on hyperglycemia-induced proliferation of either -cells or -cells in females (Fig
 K,L)
 In male mice, 96 h of hyperglycemia resulted in sustained hyperinsulinemia in InsrKO mice (Fig
 5M-O), with no differences in circulating glucagon (Fig
 P,Q)
 In male mice lacking -cell Insr, this manipulation was associated with more -cell proliferation (Fig
 R,S)
 The fact that we did not observe a suppression of glucose-induced proliferation of -cells lacking Insr prompted us to determine the degree to which the broadly defined insulin signaling pathway was inhibited in our model
 Indeed, glucose-induced Akt phosphorylation, shown by western blot of whole islet lysate, was statistically unaffected, and glucose-induced Erk phosphorylation was only reduced ~50% in Insr knockout -cells (Fig
 T)
 It is likely that the Igf1r or a receptor tyrosine-kinase-independent mechanism initiates parts of intracellular post-receptor insulin signaling in the absence of Insr
 Testing this hypothesis in the future will require truly Modelling contributions of peripheral and -cell specific insulin sensitivity to glucose homeostasis The continuum between insulin sensitivity and resistance impacts multiple tissues, including pancreatic -cells
 We observed that -cell-specific insulin resistance resulted in insulin hypersecretion in the context of unchanged -cell mass
 We next used mathematical modelling to generate quantitative predictions of the dependence of glucose tolerance on both -cell and whole-body insulin resistance, both independently and synchronously
 As described in the methods section, we modified the Topp model (Topp et al, 2000) to include insulin receptor-mediated negative feedback on insulin secretion, as indicated by our experimental data, with S serving as the -cell Insr-specific insulin sensitivity parameter (see equations in Fig
 6A; for InsrKO mice, S = )
 Peripheral insulin sensitivity is represented by SP, (SI in the original Topp model)
 We used our hyperglycemic clamp data (Figs
 4C-H, S5A,B) to estimate S in both female and male control mice and found S,female to be significantly different from zero (S,female = 
4 +/- 
5 nM--)
 S,male was not significantly different from zero (S,male = -
05 +/- 
0 nM
 )
 In silico glucose tolerance tests found that decreased -cell insulin-sensitivity (S) (similar to InsrKO mice) corresponded with elevated peak and plateau insulin secretion (Fig
 B)
 As expected, (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    this was predicted to drive more rapid clearance of blood glucose (Fig C)
 Analysis of areas under the curve for glucose and insulin resulting from in silico glucose tolerance tests while varying SP and S indicated that -cell insulin resistance should have a marked effect on insulin secretion and glucose tolerance, most dramatically in conditions of low peripheral insulin sensitivity
 Next, we compared the predictions of this model with experimental results
 We used the in silico AUCGlucose values as a function of both SP and S combined with averaged experimental AUGC values to estimate SP as a function of age for the low-fat diet conditions (Fig
 SC,D)
 We found that male values of SP for wildtype and mutant were indistinguishable from each other while females showed significant differences from each other and from the male values at all ages
 As expected, HFD led to reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity (Fig
 SE)
 Collectively, these simulations show how -cell insulin sensitivity and peripheral insulin sensitivity may combine to the regulation of glucose tolerance
 To test our theoretical model experimentally, we examined glucose tolerance in female and male InsrKO, InsrHET, and control littermates at multiple ages between 4 and 52 weeks in the context of two diets
 Significant improvements in glucose tolerance were observed in female mice with reduced Insr signaling at multiple ages, and in young males (Fig
 F)
 Consistent with our mathematical modelling that suggested a diminished contribution of -cell insulin resistance to glucose homeostasis in the context of greater whole-body insulin resistance, we did not observe significant effects of genotype in older male mice, or mice of either sex fed an insulin-resistance-inducing HFD (Fig
 F)
 Thus, Insr deletion has little consequence on glucose tolerance in mice with already impaired pan-tissue insulin resistance, which we and others have shown increases with age and is more The Ins1cre allele results in pre-natal gene deletion (Thorens et al, )
 To assess the effects of Insr deletion in adult -cells, and to determine the role of Insr on a different genetic background and under different housing conditions, we also phenotyped multiple cohorts of mice in which the Insrf/f allele was recombined by the Ins1 promoter-driven CreERT transgenic allele (commonly known as MIP-Cre) after injection with tamoxifen
 In agreement with our observations in mice with constitutive loss of -cell Insr, we found that glucose tolerance was significantly improved 4 weeks after -cell-specific Insr deletion in male mice (Fig
 G)
 These differences were not maintained as the mice aged and presumably became more insulin resistant
 In these mice, there were no significant differences observed in fasting glucose (control 
8 +/- 
3mM n=7 vs InsrKO  
4 +/- 
2mM n=10), -cell mass (control 
4 +/- 
3% n=3 vs InsrKO 
1 +/- 
2% n=5), or body mass (control 
1 +/- 
1g n=7 vs InsrKO 
1 +/- 
7g n=
 Collectively, these observations using an independent model and independent housing conditions lend support to our conclusion that the initial consequence of -cell We and others have shown that even modest differences in hyperinsulinemia can have profound consequences for insulin sensitivity, adiposity, fatty liver, longevity and cancer (Mehran et al, 2012; Templeman et al, 2017; Zhang et al, )
 Thus, we asked how the context-dependent glucose-stimulated insulin hyper-secretion induced by targeted -cell specific insulin resistance may affect insulin sensitivity, adiposity, and body mass over time
 Insulin sensitivity was assessed at multiple ages in the same mice
 Interestingly, insulin sensitivity was significantly improved in 10-week-old female InsrHET mice compared to littermate controls without Insr deletion (Fig
 S)
 On a high fat diet, male InsrKO and InsrHET mice had significantly improved insulin sensitivity compared to controls at 22 weeks of age
 Longitudinal tracking of 4-h fasting glucose identified relative hypoglycemia in young LFD female InsrKO and InsrHET mice, older LDF male InsrKO and InsrHET mice, and across the tested ages in HDF female mice (Fig
 A-D)
 Longitudinal tracking of body weight revealed that female mice with reduced -cell Insr consistently weighed more than controls when fed a HFD (Fig
 7E-H), consistent with the known role of hyperinsulinemia in diet-induced obesity (Mehran et al, 2012; Templeman et al, )
 We also examined the mass of several tissues at 13 weeks of age
 Interestingly, liver mass was lower in both female and male mice lacking -cell Insr (Fig
 IJ)
 Pilot experiments showed that liver Insr protein abundance appeared reduced in mice with partially or completely reduced -cell Insr, in the context of the LFD but not the HFD (Fig
 K)
 These data are (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    consistent with the concept that modest hyperinsulinemia can drive down insulin receptor levels and the concept that insulin signaling is a trophic signal for liver
 Together, these data demonstrate that specifically preventing autocrine insulin feedback can have systemic effects on insulin sensitivity, body mass, and the size of some tissues
 These changes may affect the eventual susceptibility to type 2 The goal of the present study was to establish the role of -cell specific insulin resistance on -cell function and glucose homeostasis using specific genetic loss-of-function tools
 We found that in vivo Insr deletion potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by increasing action potential firing and Ca2+ oscillation frequency, leading to improved glucose tolerance in insulin sensitive animals
 Our data therefore suggest a model in which insulin inhibits its own secretion in a context-dependent manner and that this local negative feedback loop has physiological consequences for glucose tolerance
 Autocrine signaling in endocrine cells is generally a negative feedback (Norman and Henry, 2014), with a few exceptions in specific conditions (Ma et al, )
 Given the abundance of Insr protein in islets and the physiological modulation of both insulin and Insr signaling in health and disease, autocrine and paracrine insulin signaling have been topics of interest and controversy for decades (Braun et al, 2012; Leibiger et al, )
 While some have questioned whether local insulin levels are sufficient for signaling within the islet, mathematical modelling of insulin hexamer dissolution estimated that monomeric insulin within islets is in the picomolar range (Wang et al, 2013), similar to the dose that maximally activates insulin signaling pathways (Alejandro et al, 2010; Beith et al, )
 Consistent with a narrow range of responsiveness, our results also show that the contribution of autocrine insulin feedback to glucose homeostasis depends on whether mice are on a diet or at an age where insulin resistance is high, and potentially saturated in -cells
 Background genetics, diet, housing conditions, microbiome, or glucose concentrations could contribute to differences in observed phenotypes between our -cell specific Insr knockout models and the frank diabetes reported for transgenic models that use fragments of the Ins2 or Pdx1 promoters to drive Cre-mediated -cell insr deletion (Kulkarni et al, 1999; Okada et al, 2007; Otani et al, )
 However, we believe that the discrepancy is more likely due to depletion of Insr in key neuronal populations since both of Ins2 and Pdx1 are expressed in brain regions that influence glucose homeostasis (Vogt and Bruning, 2013; Wicksteed et al, a)
 For example, Insr deletion in the brain with Nestin Cre causes insulin resistance (Plum et al, 2005) and impairs the sympathoadrenal response to hypoglycemia (Fisher et al, 2005), while Insr knockout using AgRP Cre results in abnormal suppression of hepatic glucose production (Konner et al, )
 We expect that our InsrKO mouse line is the most tissue specific model used to date for the study of autocrine insulin signaling and -cell insulin resistance
 Using genetic and genomic tools, our work complements previous studies in humans and animal models
 Ex vivo studies of perfused canine pancreata found an inhibitory autocrine effect of insulin (Iversen and Miles, )
 Similarly, exogenous insulin perfusion of canine pancreas in situ was shown to lead to reduced endogenous insulin production (Rappaport et al, )
 In vivo insulin infusion rapidly suppressed C-peptide levels in healthy men, but not those with obesity and presumably global insulin resistance (Cavallo-Perin et al, )
 In isolated human islets, perifusion studies showed that treatment with physiological doses of insulin had no effect on C-peptide release (Johnson and Misler, 2002b), while static incubation experiments found only moderate potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with super-physiological levels of insulin (Braun et al, )
 Our conclusions are in line with the recent work of Paschen et al reporting that a high fat, high sucrose diet induced tissue-selective insulin resistance in -cells, as well as profound hyperinsulinemia and -cell hyper-excitability (Paschen et al, )
 Our mechanistic finding that Insr knockout -cells have increased action potential firing frequency is consistent with previous observations that insulin directly increased KATP currents via PI3-kinase signaling (Khan et al, 2001) and that PI3-kinase inhibition with wortmannin potentiates glucose stimulated insulin secretion in normal, but not T2D, human islets (Kolic et al, )
 Our studies further illustrate the molecular mechanisms of negative autocrine Beyond the potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, transcriptomic analysis of fully and partially Insr-deficient -cells revealed a broad re-wiring of multiple signaling pathways and gene networks that are expected to change how these cells respond to stresses

 ;    our model biased the combined insulin/Igf signaling pathway towards Ras/MAP-kinase signaling and increased in the capacity for cytokine signaling that could modulate cell fate
 The conditions under which these gene expression changes could manifest in -cell proliferation or increased -cell survival remain incompletely explored
 Otani et al reported modestly reduced -cell mass in non-diabetic Ins-Cre transgenic Insr knockouts, which was exacerbated by diabetes, but they did not employ Cre controls (Otani et al, )
 Okada et al reported impaired compensatory -cell proliferation in the context of high fat diet or liver Insr knockout in the same experimental groups (Okada et al, )
 These previous studies comparing -cell knockout mice of Insr versus Igf1r, suggested a more important role for the former in -cell proliferation and survival (Okada et al, )
 Insulin receptor over-expression experiments also support the idea that -cells are key insulin targets (Okamoto et al, )
 In the present study, we were unable to identify conditions which would result in statistically significant differences in -cell mass in mice with Insr deficiency, but variability was high and relatively few animals were studied at older ages
 We have previously shown that the increase in -cell mass resulting from high fat diet requires local insulin production and is independent of hyperglycemia (Mehran et al, 2012), consistent with the known direct anti-apoptotic and mitogenic effects of insulin in vitro (Beith et al, 2008; Johnson et al, 2006a; Muller et al, )
 These findings can be reconciled by proposing that high insulin concentrations within the islet are sufficient to activate remaining Igf1 receptors linked to biased post-receptor signaling
 We observed that sustained hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia over 4 days was associated with increased proliferation, but whether these are effects are mediated through Igf1r function compensation will require double receptor knockout experiments
 It is also possible that hyperglycemia itself is a major driver of -cell proliferation under these conditions, through Irs2-Creb signaling that may bypass Insr/Igf1r (Jhala et al, )
 It has also been demonstrated that ~80% of the gene expression changes attributed to glucose in MIN6 cells require full insulin receptor expression (Ohsugi et al, )
 We have previously found that glucose cannot stimulate primary mouse -cell proliferation when autocrine insulin signaling is blocked by somatostatin and that glucose-induced Erk phosphorylation requires full insulin secretion (Alejandro et al, 2010; Beith et al, )
 On the other hand, inhibiting Insr in mouse islets with S961 or shRNA did not block glucose-induced proliferation of cultured -cells (Stamateris et al, )
 Additional Early hyperinsulinemia is a feature of -cell Insr knockout models on multiple genetic backgrounds (Kulkarni et al, 1999; Okada et al, 2007; Otani et al, 2004), including the present study
 Loss of Irs1 or Akt function results in basal hyperinsulinemia and, in some cases, increased -cell mass (Bernal-Mizrachi et al, 2004; Kido et al, 2000), mimicking the early stages in human diabetes
 Our experiments begin to shed light on the systemic consequences of the hyperinsulinemia caused by -cell-specific insulin resistance, which may be an early event in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes
 Human data  suggests that -cell insulin resistance can be found in the obese state prior to hyperglycemia (Cavallo-Perin et al, )
 We and others have shown that hyperinsulinemia contributes to insulin resistance and obesity (Mehran et al, 2012; Templeman et al, 2015), through multiple mechanisms including the down-regulation of insulin receptors (Knutson et al, )
 We observed propensity for excessive diet-induced body mass gain in mice with -cell specific insulin resistance, as well as Insr protein down-regulation in the liver
 Thus, -cell defects such as impaired autocrine feedback through Insr may contribute to insulin hypersecretion and accelerate the early stages of type 2 diabetes (Esser et al, )
 In the later stages, the lack of pro-survival insulin signaling, perhaps in combination with other molecular defects, may contribute to failures in -cell compensation and survival, thereby further accelerating the course of the disease (Gunton et al, 2005; Kulkarni et al, 1999; Ohsugi et al, 2005; Okada et al, 2007; Otani et al, )
  Our studies illustrate the power of using both females and males to study integrated physiology
 Indeed, -cell Insr loss led to increased -cell action potentials, calcium oscillations, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in 16-week-old female mice, but not in age-matched males
 No intrinsic sex differences of Insr mRNA levels were in a transcriptomic analysis of sorted -cells (Stancill et al, )
 Given the abundance of data showing more pronounced insulin resistance in males (Parks et al, 2015; Yki-Jarvinen, 1984), the most likely reason for these female-specific phenotypic responses to -cell Insr deletion was the development of insulin resistance in control males but not in control females
 To this point, glucose tolerance is improved in 4-week-old InsrKO males, an age at which control males remain insulin-sensitive, and in male mice with acute loss of Insr
 More work will be needed to confirm this possibility, and to determine factors in addition to sex hormones and sex (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    chromosomes that impact these sex differences in insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis (Mauvais-Jarvis, )
 The sex-specific nature of phenotypes arising from our genetic manipulation of Insr in -cells highlights the importance of including both sexes to accurately interpret data and to While our study is comprehensive and employs the best genetic tools available today, this work has limitations
 Ins1Cre is the most  cell-specific Cre deletion strain available today (Thorens et al, 2015), but this fact does not preclude off-tissue effects that have yet to be discovered
 Cre recombinase itself is not totally benign
 These facts and our detailed comparison of Ins1wt/wt mice with Ins1Cre/wt mice (Figs
 S7-10), highlight the importance of the Cre control group we employed throughout our studies
 Recently, it was reported that some colonies of Ins1cre mice exhibited some silencing via DNA hypermethylation at the Ins1 locus and this was suggested as an explanation for discordance between the phenotypes compared to gene deletions using Pdx1-Cre and Ins2-Cre transgenic lines (Mosleh et al, )
 In our study, we observed virtually complete recombination in -cells and no evidence for off-tissue Insr deletion
 We believe a major source of discrepancy with previously reported phenotypes stems from the propensity of previous promoter transgenic strains to recombine in the brain and robust expression of Insr throughout the brain
 Another caveat of our experiments using InsrKO mice is that Insr is expected to be deleted from -cells starting in late fetal development (Thorens et al, )
 In our hands, tamoxifen-inducible Ins1CreERT mice have insufficient -cell specific recombination for in vivo physiological studies
 Our validation experiments using the tamoxifen-inducible Ins-CreERT address this limitation and confirm that -cell insulin resistance improves glucose tolerance, at least under the initial insulin sensitive conditions
 It should also be noted that, because we show that long-term deletion of Insr results in profound re-wiring of the -cell transcriptome, the physiological changes can be the result of either direct or indirect action of Insr signaling
 It should also be emphasized that, while we have deleted Insr, insulin can signal through Igf1r and Igf2r, especially at the higher concentrations predicted in the pancreas
 A further caveat is that the molecular mechanisms involved in insulin secretion may be different in mouse and human -cells (Rorsman and Ashcroft, 2018), although we note that direction of effect we surmise agrees with the majority of human and canine studies, indicating general agreement across species (Cavallo-Perin et al, 1993; Elahi et al, 1982; Iversen and Miles, 1971; Rappaport et al, )
 In conclusion, our work demonstrates a key modulatory role for autocrine insulin negative feedback and the lack thereof (i
 e
 -cell resistance) in insulin secretion, glucose homeostasis and body mass, which depend on the physiological context studied
 We hope our studies resolved longstanding and controversial questions about the local effect of insulin on -cells, and lead to experimental and theoretical studies that incorporate Insr-mediated signaling in other islet cell types

 Before conducting our main study, we did a pilot experiment to determine whether the Ins1cre knock-in mice had any phenotype on their own under both low fat and high fat diets, and we tracked both control genotypes for the majority of our studies
 Although Insrwt/wt;Ins1cre/wt;nTnG and Insrf/f;Ins1wt/wt:nTnG control mice exhibited generally similar phenotypes, we observed key differences that reinforced the rationale for using controls containing Cre and lacking 1 allele of Ins1, matching the higher levels of plasma proinsulin in comparison to Insrwt/wt;Ins1cre/wt;nTnG mice at 16 and 28 weeks of age (Fig
 S)
 At several ages, both LFD and HFD fed female Insrf/f;Ins1wt/wt;nTnG/- mice exhibited trends toward slightly improved glucose tolerance (Fig
 S8), most likely due to one extra allele of insulin, in comparison to Insrwt/wt;Ins1cre/wt;nTnG mice
 Insulin sensitivity was generally similar, although not identical (Fig
 S)
 Longitudinal tracking of body weight revealed a consistent tendency for mice with a full complement of insulin gene alleles to be heavier than mice in which 1 allele of Ins1 had been replaced with Cre
 With the statistical power we had available, female HFD-fed Insrf/f;Ins1wt/wt;nTnG mice had significantly increased body mass at 11 and 16 weeks of age in comparison to Insrwt/wt;Ins1cre/wt;nTnG mice (Fig
 S)
 Once we had established the effects of the Ins1cre allele on its own, we used a breeding strategy ensuring that all pups were born with 3 insulin alleles to control for any effects of reduced insulin gene dosage (See Fig
 C)

0 for 15min at 95oC, or by transferring sections to prewarmed 1N HCl for 25 min at oC
 Samples were washed with PBS twice and were either blocked for 10 min at room temperature (Dako protein block #X0909), or with goat block (GB) with Triton X-100 (10% BSA + 5% Goat Serum with 
5% Triton X-100) for 1-4 h at room temperature
 Samples were incubated overnight at 4oC in primary antibodies #2760S), anti-BrdU (1:250, Abcam ab6326), anti-GLUT2 (1:1000, Milipore, #-)
 Following 3 PBS washes (5 min each), samples were incubated for 30min or 1h at room temperature in secondary antibodies in a light-deprived humid chamber
 Secondary antibodies applied were anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-488 (1:200, Invitrogen, # A-11008), anti-rabbit Alexa-488 (1:200, Invitrogen, #A11034), anti-rat Alexa-594 (1:200, Invitrogen, #A11007), anti-guinea pig Alexa-647 (1:200, Invitrogen, #A21450), anti-guinea pig Alexa-594 (1:200, Invitrogen #A-)
 Samples were mounted with either VECTASHIELD Hard Set Mounting Medium (Vector labs, # H-1500) or Fluoroshield both containing DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, #F6182-20ML) following an additional three washes in PBS (10 min each)
 For -cell area quantification, whole pancreas sections were imaged using an ImageXpressMICRO using a 10x (NA 
3) objective and analyzed using the MetaXpress software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA)
 Beta cell area was calculated as insulin positive area normalized to the entire pancreas of each section
 The mean of five sections from 5 regions of the pancreas were quantified
 For other immunofluorescence analysis of fixed tissue, we used a Zeiss 200M microscope using 20x air objective (NA 
75), NIKON fully motorized for Phase and Fluorescence Ti-E microscope
 For live cell imaging for recombination validation, islets from Ins1cre/wt:nTnG mice were incubated with CellMask Deep Red Plasma membrane stain (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher - Catalog number: C10046) using a Blood collection and in vivo analysis of glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion  Tail blood was collected for blood glucose measurements using a glucometer (OneTouch Ultra 2 meter, Lifescan, Canada) for single time points as well as during glucose and insulin tolerance tests
 Mice were fasted for 4h or 16h during single timepoints and for 6h during glucose and insulin tolerance tests, as well as glucose stimulated insulin secretion tests
 The i
 p
 glucose dose was 2g/kg unless otherwise specified
 The i
 p
 Humalog (Eli Lilly and Co) insulin dose was 
75U unless otherwise indicated
 1-2 days prior to femoral blood collection the experimental mice were tube handled and shaved
 Femoral blood was collected for single timepoints, as well as for measurements of in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion after i
 p
 injection of 2g/kg glucose
 Blood samples were kept on ice during collection, centrifuged at 2000rpm for 10min at 4oC and stored as plasma at -oC
  Plasma samples were analysed for insulin (Stellux Chemi Rodent Insulin ELISA, Alpco #80-INSMR-CH10), -)
 Measurements were performed on a Spark plate reader (TECAN), and analysed using We used a modified version of the Topp model (Topp et al, 2000) to simulate glucose and insulin dynamics (see equations in Fig
 A)
 Parameter values for the glucose and insulin equations were modified by hand so that the model matched a typical wildtype female low-fat-diet glucose tolerance test time series and predicted the observed beta cell mass in these mice
 We included an inhibition factor, 1/(1 + S I), multiplying the insulin secretion term that accounts for insulin receptor-mediated negative feedback on insulin secretion, parametrized by S, -cell Insr-specific insulin sensitivity
 In glucose clamp conditions, a simple equation relates S to steady state insulin levels in wildtype and * is the steady state insulin level for wild type control * is the equivalent for the InsrKO mice
 We assumed that, at each time point after the first one in the glucose-clamp insulin measurements, the blood insulin levels were hovering around steady (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    state and all other parameters and variables were constant (Fig
 SA)
 We used those steady state data points to estimate S for the male and female wild type mice using this equation
 Glucose tolerance tests were simulated for various S and SP values by calculating the IG system steady state values for each S and SP, then using the steady state value as the initial condition for insulin, and steady state plus 20 mM as the initial condition for glucose
 Fig
 6A shows sample in silico glucose tolerance tests for various values of S, with SP fixed at 
 The glucose tolerance area under the glucose curve (AUGC) was then calculated for each set of S and SP, generating a numerical map from S and SP to AUGC
 From the glucose tolerance tests in wildtype and mutant male mice and wildtype and mutant female mice, we calculated the experimental AUGC values at 4, 9, 21 and 39 weeks
 Using the computed AUGC map and the S values calculated from the glucose-clamp data, we estimated the SP value that would give the experimental AUGC (Fig
 S5C)  Data are presented as mean +/- SEM, with individual data points, unless otherwise indicated
 T-tests were performed when only 2 groups were compared at a single timepoint
 One-way ANOVA was applied when three groups were compared at a single timepoint
 Mixed effects model statistics were used for statistical analysis of GTT, ITT, GSIS experiments
 Specifically, a fitted mixed model (Prism 8, Graph Pad), which allows for missing measurements and un-even group sizes, was applied when 2 or more groups were compared at multiple time points (e
