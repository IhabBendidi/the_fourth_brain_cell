 ;    Objective: Sleep disruption is frequently associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 55 hyperglycemia
 We recently reported the effectiveness of a continuous care intervention (CCI) 56 emphasizing nutritional ketosis for improving HbA1c, body weight and cardiovascular risk 57 factors in T2D patients
 The present study assessed the effect of this CCI approach on sleep 58 Methods: A non-randomized, controlled longitudinal study; 262 T2D and 116 prediabetes 60 patients enrolled in the CCI and 87 separately recruited T2D patients continued usual care (UC) 61 treatment
 Patients completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire
 A PSQI 62 score of >5 (scale 0 to 21) was used to identify poor sleepers
 63 Results: Global sleep quality improved in the CCI T2D (p<
001) and prediabetes (p<
001) 64 patients after one year of intervention
 Subjective sleep quality (component 1), sleep 65 disturbance (component 5) and daytime dysfunction (component 7), also showed improvements 66 in the CCI T2D (p<
01 for sleep quality and sleep disturbance; and p<
001 for daytime 67 dysfunction) and prediabetes patients (p<
001 for all three components); compared to the UC 68 T2D group after one year
 The proportion of patients with poor sleep quality was significantly 69 reduced after one year of CCI (T2D; from 
3% at baseline to 
5% at one year, p=
001 and 70 prediabetes; from 
9% at baseline to 
7% at one year, p<
 )
 71 Conclusion: This study demonstrates improved sleep quality as assessed by PSQI in patients 72 with T2D and prediabetes undergoing CCI including nutritional ketosis but not in T2D patients 73 receiving UC
 The dietary intervention benefited both sleep quality and the severity of T2D 74 symptoms suggesting that nutritional ketosis improves overall health via multiple mechanisms

 ;    Sleep disruption is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), yet the 83 bidirectional relationship between sleep and glucose metabolism is not fully understood
 It is 84 linked to increased diabetes prevalence in both experimental 1-4 and epidemiological studies -
 85 In addition, the severity of hyperglycemia in individuals with diabetes is associated with poor 86 sleep quality 8,9, 10, 11, short sleep duration 8,9, 12,13 and a greater tendency to develop sleep 87 disorders including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) ,
 Both the International Diabetes 88 Federation (IDF) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend evaluating T2D 89 patients for sleep breathing problems especially OSA and strongly encourage treatment when 90  Weight loss is one of the most effective ways to improve sleep quality, quantity 92 [Yannakoulia, 2017 and Xanthpoulos 2018] and to treat OSA in obese patients
 Lifestyle 93 intervention induced weight loss showed significant reduction in the apnea and hypopnea 94 indices (AHI) in conjunction with a decrease in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in a randomized 95 controlled trial of obese OSA patients with comorbid diabetes 
 Further, weight loss following 96 bariatric surgery is effective at improving glycemic control and improving AHI in OSA patients 
 97 Intervention studies specifically targeting sleep disruption in OSA patients without any effect on 98 weight, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, have shown 99 contradictory results for glycemic control
 Most CPAP intervention studies in T2D reported no 100 glycemic benefit from the treatment 20,21, but one study demonstrated a slight reduction in 101 HbA1c 
 In contrast, CPAP studies on prediabetic OSA patients showed improvements in 102 insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance ,
 It is not clear from these studies whether 103 improvement of glycemic control in conjunction with weight loss improves sleep quality or vice-104 not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    A few studies have investigated the impact of dietary macronutrient composition on 106 sleep duration and quality
 Two studies reported reduction of slow wave sleep (SWS) and 107 elevation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in individuals consuming higher carbohydrates 108 (600g carbohydrate or 80% energy from carbohydrate) ,
 Another study reported the effect of 109 a high carbohydrate (56% energy from carbohydrate) diet in reducing sleep onset latency when 110 compared to a control diet 
 Studies investigating low carbohydrate diets showed the opposite 111 effect; reduced REM 28, increased REM onset latency 29 and increased SWS 28, even after 4 112 hours of administering a very low carbohydrate meal 
 Collectively, these findings signify 113 dietary carbohydrate content as an important factor in modulating sleep architecture, but 114 extrapolation from these studies is limited since they were conducted in experimentally 115 controlled conditions with small numbers of healthy individuals in a short time-span and with 116 Population and intervention-based studies on the overall impact of carbohydrate intake 118 on sleep indices or sleep quality are very limited
 Katagiri et al showed reduced sleep quality in 119 individuals consuming more carbohydrates as measured by a subjective sleep measure, the 120 Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 
 Studies investigating the effect of ketogenic diet (KD) 121 in children with sleep problems showed improvement in daytime sleepiness 31,32 as well as 122 positive changes in sleep architecture ,
 However, in one of these studies, sleep 123 improvements were suggested to be due to weight loss rather than the KD 
 Despite restricted 124 carbohydrate intake concurrent with sleep improvement in these children, SWS decreased 33 125 and REM increased 32,33 which contradicts studies on carbohydrate intake and sleep 126 architecture in adults ,,
 Carbohydrate restriction and ketogenic diets are widely used in the 127 clinical management of obesity and diabetes, but studies assessing the effect of this diet on 128 sleep are currently limited
 We recently demonstrated a continuous remote care treatment for 129 T2D including nutritional ketosis significantly improved glycemic control, weight, and 130 cardiovascular disease risk factors and reduced diabetes medication use at one year -

 ;    The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of the intervention by time-interval on the 132 global PSQI and its seven component scores as well as compared its changes with different 133 intervention and disease categories
 We also assessed the relationship between changes in the 134 sleep parameters versus key biochemical parameters, and also investigated the correlation of 135 pain, circadian rhythm disruption and CPAP usage versus patient-perceived sleep status
 We 136 hypothesized that the global sleep indexes would improve analogously, as improvement in other 137 This study is part of a clinical trial (Clinical trials
gov identifier: NCT02519309) that was 141 approved by the Franciscan Health Lafayette Institutional Review Board
 Patients between age 142 21 and 65 years with either a diagnosis of T2D and a BMI > 25 kg/m2 or prediabetes and a BMI 143 > 30 kg/m2 were included in this study
 Detailed study design including the inclusion and 144 exclusion criteria were previously reported ,
 Briefly, the trial was an open-label, non-145 randomized, controlled, longitudinal study with patients divided into three groups
 The T2D and 146 pre-diabetes patients in the continuous care intervention (CCI) regimen self-selected either on-147 site (CCI-onsite) or web-based (CCI-web) education delivery
 Educational content and medical 148 treatment was the same for both CCI-onsite and CCI-web
 As there were no significant 149 differences in outcomes including PSQI scores, between educational groups, they are combined 150 for further analysis ,
 Both T2D and prediabetes CCI patients had access to a mobile health 151 application (app) that enabled them to communicate and be continuously monitored by a team 152 of healthcare professionals including a personal health coach and physician or nurse 153 practitioner
 Patients received individualized guidance in achieving nutritional ketosis, typically 154 including restriction of daily dietary carbohydrates to less than 30 grams
 Patients were 155 encouraged to measure and input weight, blood glucose and blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) 156 concentrations daily in the app

 This 162 group was observed at baseline and one year as reference for typical disease treatment and 163 progression within the same geography and health system
 (UC patients were informed that the 164 trial had an intervention arm and could participate in that group if they chose to do so)
 165 Patient demographic and clinical data were collected at baseline, 70 days and one year
 167 Laboratory measures were assessed at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement (CLIA) certified 168 laboratory
 These data were initially analyzed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the 169 CCI in improving diabetes status (glycemic control and medication use), weight and other 170 metabolic factors in T2D 34,35 and prediabetes patients 36(unpublished data, manuscript in 171 preparation)
 Some of the clinical variables - weight, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, homeostatic 172 model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), BHB and high sensitivity C-reactive protein 173 (hsCRP) - were included for further analyses in this study
 Usual care T2D patients were not 174 continuously monitored for weight, blood glucose, or BHB; clinical and laboratory measures 175 were obtained for this group only at baseline and one year
  176  CCI patients were administered a set of questionnaires, including the PSQI, during visits 179 at baseline, 70 days and one year; UC participants completed questionnaires at baseline and 180 one year
 The PSQI consists of 19 validated questions assessing sleep quality and efficiency 
 181 The global PSQI score is calculated from seven component scores on subjective sleep quality 182 (component 1), sleep latency (component 2), sleep duration (component 3), habitual sleep 183 not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    efficiency (component 4), sleep disturbances (component 5), use of sleep medication 184 (component 6) and daytime dysfunction (component )
 Each question within the component is 185 scored on a 4-point Likert scale of 0 to 3, with 3 indicating worse outcomes and the mean was 186 calculated for each component score
 The sum of the component score means generates the 187 global PSQI score that ranges from 0 to 
 Higher global PSQI scores indicate poorer sleep
 A 188 patient with a global PSQI score < 5 is considered a good sleeper and > 5 is categorized as a 189 poor sleeper 
 Change in the PSQI score over time was calculated using the formula below: 190  Patients were classified into pain and non-pain groups based on their response to 194 pain-related questions in both the PSQI (question 5i) and a separate questionnaire used to 195 calculate the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS)
 Overall KOOS results will be 196 reported in a separate publication
 Classification of patients under circadian rhythm disrupted 197 and non-disrupted groups was based on the wake time and bedtime responses for PSQI 198 questions 1 and 3 for compilation of component 4 (sleep efficiency)
 Patients were classified as 199 having a shifted wake-up time if they reported typically waking between 11am and 2am, while 200 those with bedtimes between 12am to 6pm were bedtime shifted
 These arbitrary bedtime and 201 wake time cut-off ranges were selected based on evening and night shift workers schedule (2nd 202 shift - 3pm to 11pm and 3rd shift- 11pm to 7am); which causes these workers to have sleep 203 patterns that deviate from a normal chronotype
 Patients were also surveyed regarding CPAP 204 usage and discontinuation, however detailed usage information such as CPAP pressure 205 settings and usage compliance were not obtained making it difficult to interpret the patients OSA 206 not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Missing data were 214 imputed by Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) 40, and Intent to treat (ITT) 215 analyses were performed
 Normality of the global PSQI and component scores was evaluated 216 using Lilliefors test
 Even after transformation, the data failed the normality test (i
 e
 there was a 217 skew toward lower PSQI scores and a long tail of higher scores) (Supplemental figures 1A-C); 218 therefore, nonparametric tests were used for analyses of PSQI scores
 Results from continuous 219 variables were expressed as mean  standard deviation
 Comparisons between groups were 220 performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and comparisons within groups were performed using 221 the Wilcoxon Sign Rank test
 Tukeys honest significant difference test was used to analyze 222 pairwise differences among significant results from omnibus tests
 McNemars test was used for 223 assessing statistical significance of transitioning between good and poor sleeper among the 224 Adjusted Pearsons and Spearman correlations were calculated between changes from 226 baseline in global PSQI and changes in metabolic-parameters
 Adjusted correlations were 227 performed while controlling for age, gender and BMI at baseline
 All participants in the CCI 228 group were stratified by sleep improvement status based on their baseline and one year global 229 PSQI scores
 Patients that were initially considered poor sleepers with a baseline PSQI > 5 230 but whose score after one year decreased to at or below the threshold of 5 were classified as 231 improved
 Those patients who were considered good sleepers at both baseline and one year 232 were classified as maintained
 Finally, those patients whose 1 year PSQI score was >5 233 (regardless of their baseline score) were classified as not improved

 These correlations observed in the prediabetes group were 292 not present in the CCI T2D group and changes in the HbA1c and hsCRP did not correlate with 293 changes in global PSQI scores in either group

 No statistically significant differences were found in weight loss changes between 297 patients with improved, maintained and not improved sleep status
 Patients who maintained 298 sleep showed highest reductions of HOMA-IR (-

 Patients were classified as having shifted sleep chronotype based on their self- 315 reported wake-up times and bedtimes as defined in the methods
 There were 18, 27, and 96 316 patients in the CCI cohort classified as both wake-up time and bedtime shifted, wake-up time 317 shifted only or bedtime shifted only respectively
 Patients with shifted bedtimes, had reduced 318 global PSQI scores (p<
01), as did those with normal chronotype (p<
001) (Supplementary 319 figures 4A and B)
 However, those patients with shifted wake-up times (Supplementary figures 320 4C) did not show a change in their global PSQI score after one year of the intervention
 Those 321 with both shifted wake-up times and bedtimes also did not show a change in their global PSQI 322  At baseline, there were a total of 140 participants in both CCI and UC treatment groups 325 with CPAP equipment prescribed for sleep
 Among CPAP users, 91 were in the CCI T2D group, 326 31 in the CCI prediabetes and 18 in the UC T2D group
 Fifteen (13 CCI T2D and 2 UC T2D) of 327 the 140 participants discontinued using CPAP at one year
  Only 6 (46%) of the 13 CCI T2D 328 participants discontinued due to patient-reported improvement in sleep quality from the CCI and 329 reduction of weight; the remaining 7 reported dis-continuation due to discomfort or personal 330 choice
 Global PSQI scores among the CPAP users at baseline and one year did not show a 331 significantly different distribution pattern than what was observed in the full cohort of 332 This study is one of the first designed to assess the effect of carbohydrate restriction and 335 nutritional ketosis on sleep quality in individuals with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance

 ;    The proportion of patients categorized as poor sleepers at one year was significantly reduced 339 in the CCI groups but not in the UC group
 Furthermore, these results demonstrate that the 340 sleep quality improvement observed in the whole intervention population was due in part to 17% 341 of baseline poor sleepers being reclassified as good sleepers at one year
 Our results are 342 consistent with previous findings that showed improved overall sleep quality in children 343 Improvement in the global PSQI score of patients undergoing the CCI was mainly 345 due to significant changes in three PSQI components: subjective sleep quality, sleep 346 disturbance and daytime dysfunction
 Both objective and subjective sleep quality impairment are 347 frequently reported in diabetes patients and positively associated with severity of hyperglycemia 348 -
 Likewise, correlation between poor sleep quality and increased carbohydrate intake 30 is 349 also previously reported
 These observed patterns of association between sleep quality with 350 hyperglycemia and carbohydrate intake may explain why this carbohydrate restriction 351 intervention improved subjective sleep quality
 The sleep disturbance component of the global 352 PSQI score is associated with poor glycemic control among T2D patients 
 One study reported 353 a significant correlation between sleep disturbance and HbA1c level 
 Night time sleep 354 disturbance in T2D patients can be related to a wide range of conditions such as nocturnal 355 polyuria, pain, and breathing problems, especially in those with OSA
 In our study, we also 356 showed that patients encountering persistent pain, including knee pain, had a higher median 357 global PSQI score, while one year of the intervention effectively improved global PSQI scores in 358 these patients despite the persistence of reported pain in some patients
 It is possible that 359 improvement in the sleep disturbance of the CCI patients contributed to the glycemic control 360 improvement in these patients
 The effectiveness of the intervention in improving sleep in those 361 with pain, further emphasizes its applicability in alleviating sleep disturbance
 362 Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in the daytime dysfunction component 363 of the global PSQI score in the CCI group

 ;    reported commonly in T2D 45,46, and weight loss through bariatric surgery has a positive 365 resolving effect on daytime dysfunction and sleepiness ,
 In the present investigation, the 366 majority of CCI patients achieved weight loss of  10%, which could have contributed to the 367 significant improvement observed in daytime function
 In addition, we also evaluated the effect 368 of the intervention on a subcohort of patients with a self-reported pattern of shifted non-standard 369 bedtimes and wake-up times that were not aligned to the light dark cycle, which likely affects 370 daytime functioning
 Circadian rhythm disruption is frequently associated with metabolic 371 alterations, especially in an insulin resistant state ,
 While patients with a normal sleep 372 chronotype benefited the most, the intervention also improved the sleep of patients with time 373 shifted bedtimes
  A similar advantage of the intervention was not observed in patients with 374 shifted wake-up times, though this may be due to the limited number of patients in this subgroup 375  The improvement in the global PSQI score observed in CCI patients occurred 377 concurrently with weight reduction and glycemic control improvement ,
 Martin et al 51 378 reported a direct correlation between degree of weight loss and global PSQI score improvement 379 in healthy nonobese adults receiving an energy restricted diet, while Chaput et al52 reported an 380 improvement in global PSQI score following the initial 5-kg weight loss, but no additional 381 improvement with subsequent weight loss
 A study using a ketogenic diet in children alleviated 382 abnormal sleep architecture; however, weight loss was suggested as the main determinant of 383 improved sleep 
 These studies collectively imply a direct association between weight loss and 384 improved PSQI score
  Likewise, long-term maintenance of weight loss was associated with 385 better sleep quality and quantity (); while the degree of weight loss reduction is directly 386 correlated with OSA improvement()
 However, some studies also demonstrate the efficacy of 387 anti-glycemic medications for improving PSQI score concurrent with improved glycemic control 388

 ;    of patients sleep status in the full CCI cohort even though there were no significant differences 390 in weight loss and insulin resistance reduction levels between those who had improved sleep 391 and those who did not
 Patients with good sleep quality at the beginning of the intervention 392 benefited the most in reducing insulin resistance
 Improvement in fasting glucose and HOMA-IR 393 were only positively associated with improved PSQI score in prediabetes patients
  394 It is not clear if nutritional ketosis achieved by substantial carbohydrate restriction 395 augmented the effect of the intervention on sleep or if weight loss and/or improved glycemic 396 control generated from the intervention contributed to sleep quality improvements
  We showed 397 a significant correlation between blood beta-hydroxybutryrate (BHB) levels and PSQI 398 improvement in the prediabetes cohort
 While the effect of and mechanism of BHB in sleep are 399 not clear, a positive correlation between blood BHB levels and carbon dioxide (CO2) response 400 was previously reported in patients with obesity related hypoventilation syndrome that had 401 
 A continuous state of ketosis through carbohydrate restriction and fat 402 intake also induces the postprandial release of a satiety hormone, cholecystokinin (CCK),,
 403 When administered in rats, CCK was shown to promote slow wave activity and NREM sleep 
 404 CCK was also shown to induce sleep when administered in diabetic rats 
 Therefore, it is 405 possible that one mechanism of improved sleep with a ketogenic diet that increases BHB levels 406  There are several limitations of our study
 The study was designed mainly to assess the 408 impact of the CCI on glycemic control, medication use, weight, and cardiovascular disease risk 409 factors
 Patient-reported outcomes for quality of life measures including sleep were included as 410 secondary endpoints
 It is difficult to determine the causality among the intervention, 411 improvement in primary outcomes and improvement in sleep from this study
  A major limitation 412 of this study is the use of subjective sleep measures as self-reported sleep assessment is 413 subject to limited self-knowledge of sleep behavior and inconsistency in reporting
 Therefore, 414 future studies that use randomized controlled trial designs and objective sleep measures are 415 not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    needed to confirm our results
 In addition, patients with an established diagnosis of a sleep 416 disorder such as OSA were not separated in the analysis since complete records of their CPAP 417 usage were not collected in the questionnaire
 Patient compliance with CPAP usage is essential 418 for making interpretations about the status of their OSA treatment and its effect on sleep and 419 glycemic control
 The study also lacked recruitment of prediabetes patients in the UC group for 420 direct comparison of the treatment effect between UC and CCI on sleep in these patients
   421 In conclusion, these results demonstrate that overall sleep quality significantly improved 422 in T2D and prediabetes patients undergoing remote CCI including nutritional ketosis but not in 423 T2D patients in the UC group
 The sleep improvement was concurrent with weight reduction 424 and glycemic control improvement
 The PSQI components that improved were sleep quality, 425 sleep disturbance and daytime dysfunction
 These results suggest that nutritional ketosis 426 benefits overall health through improved glycemic control as well as improved sleep quality
