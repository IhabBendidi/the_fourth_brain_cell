Fracture Mechanics of Human Blood Clots: Measurements of Toughness and Critical Length scalesShiyu Liu,a Guangyu Bao,a Zhenwei Ma,a Christian J
 Kastrupb and Jianyu Li*ac Blood coagulates to plug vascular damage and stop bleeding, and thus the function of blood clots in hemostasis depends on their resistance against rupture (toughness)
 Despite the significance, fracture mechanics of blood clots remains largely unexplored, particularly the measurements of toughness and critical length scales governing clot fracture
 Here, we study the fracture behavior of human whole blood clots and platelet-poor plasma clots
 The fracture energy of whole blood clots and platelet-poor plasma clots determined using modified lap-shear method is 
 
18 J/m2 and 
 
90 J/m2, respectively
 We find that the measured toughness is independent of the specimen geometry and loading conditions
 These results reveal a significant contribution of blood cells to the clot fracture, as well as the dissipative length scale and nonlinear plug and seal the blood vessel defects, where they are exposed to shear stress, tension and blood pressure from the local tissue even fatal The fracture of the blood clots at wound sites results clot yields small pieces of thrombi that may disturb blood flow clots in human health, it is not well understood compared to the cracks
 Few works to date are reported on the toughness (i
 e
, fracture energy required to extend a unit area of crack) of blood clots are soft (shear modulus < 1 kPa) and deformable, this methods such as pure shear tests
6 Also, the wet nature of blood clots makes them difficult to grip or handle
 Lastly, blood clots are not stable and there is a limited operational time window

 The human WB was kept at 4  and the PPP was frozen at -80 
 They were thawed at room containing NaCl and CaCl2 was mixed with the tissue factor at a volume ratio of :
 The mixture was then added into the blood samples (either WB or PPP), with a final volume ratio of NaCl was fixed at 
5 mM, the final concentration of CaCl2 was after recalcification, the blood clot was kept in a sealed Ziploc the samples were incubated at 37   for 2 hours to allow Fig

 This result fracture of blood clots: the dissipative length scale   and the nonlinear elastic length scale l 
11 The former describes the size of the process zone near the crack tip during fracture and reflects the flaw sensitivity of a material, while the latter depicts crack tip (as illustrated in Fig
 C)
10 The dissipative length scale was estimated by the ratio of the fracture energy to the work to rupture,  =  *W 
 The work to rupture *W  was characterized by loading specimens without a cut to rupture using the same setup (lap shear test in this study) and defined by the area under ratio of the fracture energy to the shear modulus, = l E 
 As can be seen, the length scales were on the order of 
1-1 mm, The two length scales provide insights for modeling the crack tip and PPP clots from this work, and those reported in literature clot8, the WB clots have a smaller flaw sensitivity length scale of the fact that the WB clots contain large fraction of blood cells
