 ;    Drug-related cognitive biases have been positively associated with drug-craving and 45 increased likelihood of relapse
 Cognitive bias modification paradigms have been 46 developed to attenuate cognitive biases but there have been few studies that 47 examined neural responses to these paradigms
 This study compared neural 48 responses following CBM and explored whether CBM effects were potentiated by 49 varenicline administration
 This was a double-blind placebo-controlled study with two 50 between subject factors of drug (varenicline, placebo) and CBM (attend towards 51 smoking cues, train away from smoking cues, control training) that recruited daily (> 10 52 cigarettes per day) non-treatment seeking smokers
 Participants (n = 67, 53% female) 53 were randomised to one-week of drug administration (varenicline or placebo) before 54 attending a study session at which they were randomised to CBM condition, and 55 underwent an fMRI scan were they were presented with smoking and neutral cues
 56 Neural response to smoking (vs
 neutral) cues, cognitive bias, craving and mood were 57 assessed
 There was no evidence of CBM effects on any outcomes
 There was 58 evidence of effects of varenicline on craving, with greater reductions in craving in the 59 week preceding the study session in the varencline group (p = 
04, pwas also evidence of a drug by CBM interaction for neural responses (z = 
78, p 61 <
 )
 Compared to placebo, varenicline was associated with greater activation in 62 the right temporal middle gyrus in the CBM control condition, compared to an opposite 63 effect in the CBM attend towards condition
 These data suggest that CBM does not 64 modify cognitive bias, subjective craving and mood, or neural response to smoking 65 cues
 There was also no evidence that CBM effects were potentiated by varenicline

 ;    Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death worldwide, with an 68 estimated 6 million tobacco-related deaths occurring every year (World Health 69 Organization, )
 Despite many smokers reporting wanting to quit, few achieve 70 long-term abstinence
 This may be partly due to the presence of smoking-related cues 71 in the environment, which through repeated and contingent pairing with drug 72 and drug seeking (Foltin & Haney, 2000; Gray, LaRowe, & Upadhyaya, 2008; 74 McClernon et al, 2016; Mucha, Pauli, & Angrilli, 1998; Muntaner et al, )
  75 attention allocation to drug cues, have been reported in users of a number of drugs 77 and have been positively associated with drug craving (Field, Munafo, & Franken, 78 2009; Wakefield, Germain, & Henriksen, 2008), future drug use (Cox, Pothos, & 79 Hosier, 2007), approach behaviours to drug-related cues (Franken, 2003) and 80 increased likelihood of relapse (Marissen, Franken, Blanken, van den Brink, & 81 Hendriks, )
 Of particular importance, the drug-stimulus learning that is believed to 82 underlie these biases is long-lasting, which makes an individual vulnerable to relapse 83 long after initial cessation
 In smokers, increased reactivity to smoking cues has been 84 found to predict decreased likelihood of cessation (Abrams, Monti, Carey, Pinto, & 85 Jacobus, 1988; Niaura, Abrams, Demuth, Pinto, & Monti, 1989; Waters et al, )
 86 Consequently, reduction in cognitive bias is a potential target for therapeutic 87 There is evidence that it is possible to reduce cognitive biases using computer-89 based cognitive bias modification (CBM) paradigms that train individuals to allocate 90 attention away from disorder-relevant cues
 CBM has been shown to reduce cognitive  91 and has also been associated with reduction in other symptoms such as low mood 92 (Baert, De Raedt, Schacht, & Koster, )

 ;    in a group of smokers following one session of stimulus-avoidance CBM using a 95 modified dot probe task
 Compared to a group who had been trained to attend to 96 smoking cues, there was evidence that the avoid group also showed attenuated 97 craving in response to in vivo smoking cues in a subsequent cue exposure test (male 98 participants only)
 A subsequent study in tobacco smokers found similar decreases in 99 cognitive bias following CBM, but did not observe generalisation of these effects of 100 other relevant behaviours (e
 g
, cigarette craving) or novel (untrained) stimuli (Field, 101 Duka, Tyler, & Schoenmakers, )
 The weak effects may be due to the limited 102 number of sessions used in laboratory-based studies and that multiple session 103 approaches may be more efficacious than single session CBM (Lopes, Pires, & 104 Bizarro, 2014; McHugh, Murray, Hearon, Calkins, & Otto, 2010; Unrod et al, )
 105 Taken together, the research suggests CBM may have some clinical utility but the 106 effects are compromised by small effect sizes and issues with generalisation of the 107 There has been growing interest in the development of combination drug-109 behavioural therapies, in which a drug is used to augment the outcomes of a 110 behavioural intervention (Swerdlow, )
 This may offer a solution to the low efficacy 111 and reliability of CET effects, if a suitable pharmacological agent can be identified
 The 112 smoking cessation pharmacotherapy varenicline acts as a partial agonist of the 42 113 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and aids cessation by reducing cigarette craving and 114 withdrawal symptoms
 However, it has also been associated with a reduction in cue-115 related craving in humans (Ray et al, 2013), particularly following chronic 116 administration (Brandon et al, 2011), and reductions in cue-induced reinstatement of 117 drug taking in animals (Le Foll et al, 2012; Wouda et al, )
 Therefore, varenciline 118 may be a useful adjunct to CBM, particularly as it is already licensed as a smoking 119 The current study replicated earlier work by examining the effects of CBM on 121 behavioural measures of cognitive bias (visual dot probe and modified Stroop), and 122 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    extended the work in two important ways
 First, we examined whether 7-day pre-123 treatment of varenicline enhanced the effects of CET on smoking cue reactivity and 124 attentional bias
 Second, using fMRI, we examined the neural responses to smoking 125 biases are the result of a failure of cognitive regulatory systems to increase control in 127 the presence of salient cues that increase processing in the reward and emotional 128 centres of the brain (e
 g
, striatum, amygdala) (Hester & Luijten, )
 Therefore, 129 these additional measures offer important insight into the mechanisms underlying the 130 effects of CBM, particularly as computer-based measures of cognitive bias are known 131 to lack reliability (Ataya et al, 2012; Field & Christiansen, )
 132 apart
 Participants were randomised to receive either 7-day treatment of varenicline or 134 matched placebo, prior to completion of 1-hour of CBM training
 For CBM training, 135 participants were further randomised (stratified by drug group) to one of three 136 conditions: 1) training towards smoking cues (attend), 2) training away from smoking 137 cues (avoid), or 3) control training (control)
 After training, participants underwent a cue 138 reactivity task during an fMRI scan
 We hypothesised that participants in the CBM-139 avoid condition would show a decrease in cognitive bias and neural response to 140 smoking-related cues compared to those in the CBM-attend and CBM-control 141 conditions, and that changes in cognitive bias and neural response, would be greatest 142 in individuals trained to avoid smoking-related cues and treated with varenicline

 Drugs were 184 supplied by Pfizer and shipped to University Hospitals Bristol Pharmacy who 185 prepared two batches of 36 bottles (one for male and one for females)
 Within each 186 group of 36 bottles, 18 bottles contained 10 varenicline tablets (
5 mg each) and 18 187 bottles contained 10 tablets of matched placebo
 Each bottle was given a numeric 188 identifier that enabled study staff involved in data collection to be fully blinded to 189 In addition, an experimental collaborator (who had no direct contact with the 191 study participants) prepared a numeric code using random number assignment 192 software to further randomise participants to CBM groups

 Each task version comprised 768 trials
 Each trial began 210 with a fixation cross (500 ms), before a picture pair (smoking image, neutral image) 211 was presented on a computer screen
 The picture pair stayed on screen for 500 ms 212 and then was replaced by a probe (small square or circle) in a location previously 213 occupied by one of the pictures
 Participants were required to identity whether the 214 probe was a square or circle by pressing designated keyboard keys
  215 The majority of trials (n = 512) were training trials, presented in four blocks, 216 and the remainder of trials (n = 256) were test trials
 Half of the test trials (n = 128) 217 were presented prior to the training trials (baseline test), and half (n = 128) after the 218 training trials, in order to assess the effect of the CBM on cognitive bias
 In the test 219 trials, the probe appeared with equal frequency in the location of the smoking-related 220 or neutral picture
 In the training trials, the probe appeared in the location of the 221 neutral picture on 75% of trials in the avoid condition, or the smoking-related picture 222 on 75% of trials in the attend condition, or with equal frequency in the location of 223 neutral and smoking-related pictures in the control condition

2 243 cm, matrix = 64  64, flip angle = 90o, slice thickness = 3 mm, resulting in 3 mm3 244 isotropic voxels)
 A T1-weighted structural image was acquired using an MP-RAGE 245 sequence with a 
9 mm3 isotropic voxel size and 192 slices
 During the fMRI cue 246 exposure procedure, smoking-related and control cues were presented in a boxcar 247 design with four blocks per category
 Participants were required to make a button 248 press on each stimulus presentation to confirm they had seen the image (this did not 249 terminate viewing time)
 Each block lasted 40 s, during which time 8 cues were 250 presented
 Before and after each block, a crosshair was presented for 5 s
 251 Participants were then asked to rate cigarette craving on an 8-point scale (none at 252 all to extreme)
 The scale was presented for 10 s followed by a crosshair for 253 another 10 s

 At this session full written informed consent was taken by a trained 262 researcher, and then the screening procedure was completed
 This included 263 measures of expired breath alcohol and carbon monoxide, height, weight, blood 264 pressure and heart rate
 A urine screen was performed to test for recent drug use 265 (all) and pregnancy (females)
 A medical doctor then completed a general physical 266 and psychiatric health assessment, and prescribed the study medication if 267 appropriate
 Then participants completed a baseline assessment of cognitive bias 268 and withdrawal (QSU, MNWS) and mood (VASs), and a practice version of the task 270 that they would completed during the fMRI scan at the second visit (Day )
 271 Participants were then sent away with the study medication, medication 272 packaging information and a drug diary (which they were required to complete and 273 return at the next visit)
 The second session (test day) was then scheduled for 274 approximately one week later
 This session fell on day 7 of their drug regimen
 275 On the test day (Day 7), participants returned with their drug diaries and any 276 untaken medication
 Prior to the scan, they completed the Stroop task followed by a 277 short visual dot probe task that measured baseline cognitive bias
 Participants then 278 completed one version of CBM (avoid, attend, control) per the study randomisation
 279 The test version of the dot-probe task was run again immediately post-CBM in order 280 to assess changes in cognitive bias
 Following this, participants completed a 4-281 minute anatomical scan and then the cue-exposure test during a 15 minute fMRI 282 scan
 After scanning, participants completed the modified Stroop task and 283 questionnaires (QSU, visual analogue scales) again

 Removals are noted in text
 Data were assessed 292 for normality and transformed using log 10 transformations (or square root where 293 data include zero scores) where deviations from normality were observed
 294 Mean reaction time data were extracted for each of the four variables from 295 the visual dot probe tests that were completed before and after CBM training (pre-296 Cognitive bias scores were calculated by subtracting RTs to probes that replaced 298 smoking-related pictures from RTs to probes that replaced neutral pictures, so that 299 positive scores represent a bias towards smoking cues and negative scores 300 represent a bias towards neutral cues
 These bias scores were used to examine 301 cognitive training effects in a 2 (pre-, post-CBM)  2 (varenicline, placebo)  3 302 A similar procedure was applied to Stroop data (test of cognitive bias 304 generalisation)
 Mean reaction times and errors were extracted for smoking and 305 neutral images during tasks completed before and after CBM training
 Bias scores 306 were calculated for each variable and used in the same 3-way mixed model ANOVA 307 (detailed above), with exception that the subtraction was reversed (i

 This was done for ease of 309 interpretation as (unlike the visual dot probe) slower scores represent cognitive bias 310 on the Stroop task
 Therefore, for Stroop data presented here positive scores 311 data were analysed in two time phase analyses using ANOVA
 We first assessed tonic 314 craving (QSU) defined as craving during drug treatment

 Each cue block (smoke, control) was 328 modelled as a boxcar function convolved with a double- hemodynamic response 329 function that begins at the onset of the first cue in the block and ends at the end of 330 the block (duration = 40 s)
 A smoking>control cue contrast image was created and 331 input into a random effects analysis
 A 2 (varenicline, placebo)  3 (attend, avoid, 332 control) mixed-model whole-brain ANOVA was used to examine smoking cue 333 reactivity (smoking greater than control) between each group
 Activation was 334 evaluated within an a priori mask of anatomical brain regions identified in a meta-335 analysis of cue reactivity (Tang, Fellows, Small, & Dagher, 2012): nucleus 336 insula, posterior cingulate cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus

 ;    We investigated the effects of CBM and one-week varenicline treatment on 484 neural response to smoking-related cues in current smokers
 There was no evidence 485 that CBM training alone altered cognitive bias (post-CBM visual dot probe, Stroop), 486 mood, craving or neural response to smoking-cues
 There was evidence of reduced 487 craving in the varenicline group as evinced by several drug by time interactions
 Across 488 the drug administration phase of the study (i
 e
, the six days preceding the study 489 session), there was a greater reduction in QSU scores for the varenicline compared to 490 placebo group
 A main effect of drug was also evident for VAS craving scores (i
 e
, 491 lower craving in varenicline group); however, the drug by time interaction was not 492 replicated
 The lower reports of craving in the varenicline group were also evident at 493 the study session, during which CBM was administered
 Finally, there was weak 494 evidence that varenicline may have attenuated CBM-induced smoking bias, as there 495 was an increase in smoking bias following CBM attend training, but only in the placebo 496 group
 There was no evidence of an interaction between varenicline and CBM on 497  There was evidence of a drug by CBM interaction on neural responses in one 499 region within our a priori cue-reactivity mask
 In right middle temporal gyrus (rMTG), 500 activation in response to smoking relative to neutral cues was greater in the placebo as 501 compared to the varenicline condition in the control CBM condition; the opposite 502 pattern was observed in the toward CBM condition
 Whereas the rTMG has been 503 shown to be active in response to viewing smoking cues in meta-analyses (Tang et al, 504 2012), little has been reported regarding its potential role in processing conditioned 505 smoking cues
 Activation in the specific rTMG location we observed, has also been 506 observed in studies of Theory of Mind, or the social-cognitive ability to infer the 507 emotional and motivational experience (Vollm et al, 2006), where it may be involved in 508 retrieval of memories associated with the behaviour of others

 ;    which such memories are accessed due to decreased tonic craving
  Why toward CBM 511 training would reverse such effects is unclear from the data, which suggests that 512 additional research is needed to fully understand the influence of CBM on the 513  Taken together these findings support a benefit of varenicline on tonic craving 515 and neural response to smoking cues (which may be driven by the craving effects)
 516 While the effects of varenicline may be small, they are meaningful given the fact that 517 the dosing regime delivered in the study is substantially lower than the clinically 518 prescribed dose (i
 e
, 1 week compared to a standard 12-week course)
 However, we 519 found no evidence of a benefit of CBM on any outcomes, and little evidence that 520 varenicline would be a useful adjunct to smoking-related CBM
  The CBM by drug 521 interaction that was observed for the fMRI data, indicated that the effects of varenicline 522 may have been attenuated for active CBM (i
 e
, the effects were only observed in the 523 control training group)
 However, numbers are small and therefore this effect requires 524  It is noteworthy that we did not find effects of CBM on measures of cognitive 526 bias (visual dot probe and Stroop)
 There are known issues with the reliability of 527 cognitive bias tests (Ataya et al, 2012), and therefore this may be a failure of the 528 measure rather than a lack of effect
 However, this indicates that the CBM may not 529 have been effective, and these findings should be interpreted with this in mind
 We 530 hypothesised that effects of CBM would be potentiated by varenicline and our failure to 531 observe such effects may be due to there being no CBM effects to strengthen
 It is 532 plausible that varenicline may potential effects of CBM if these effects can be reliably 533  There are some limitations of this study that should be considered when 535 interpreting these findings
 First, our sample size was small for the analysis of 536 interactions
 Our planned recruitment of 72 participants was achieved but not all 537 participants were tested to completion, and our final sample was lower (n = 67 for 538 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    subjective and cognitive data; n = 64 for fMRI data)
 We also have a computer 539 malfunction for one of the conditions that was not identified until data were extracted
 540 We had to replace a number of participants in one CBM condition (avoid) and therefore 541 these individuals were tested outside of the randomisation sequence
 We do not 542 however expect that this had a substantial effect on outcomes as these individuals 543 were testing in close time proximity to the rest of the sample
 Furthermore, the 544 researchers collecting data were not aware of the reason for additional recruitment, 545 and therefore double-blinding was maintained
 Third, our study recruited non-treatment 546 seeking smokers, and it is plausible that effects of CBM may be stronger in individuals 547  This study investigated neural responses to smoking cues following varenicline 549 and CBM treatment
 There was little evidence of neural effects of either drug or CBM
 550 However, there was evidence of reductions in craving among smokers who completed 551 one-week of varenicline treatment
 Drug by CBM interactions were exploratory due to 552 small sample sizes, but we observed an interaction on right temporal gyrus activity
 553 Specifically, varenicline appeared to attenuate cue-related activity in the right temporal 554 gyrus that was presented in the placebo group
 However, this effect should be 555 replicated in future research
