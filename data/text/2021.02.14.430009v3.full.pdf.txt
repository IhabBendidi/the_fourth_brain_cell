 ;    Background: The most abundant polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners found in the 23 environment and in humans are the ortho-substituted, non-dioxin-like (NDL) congeners, 24 especially PCB
 While evidence indicates that exposure to PCB153 and other NDL-PCBs 25 in early vertebrate development can contribute to neurobehavioral disorders, the basis of 26 Methods: We assessed a range of effects of several NDL-PCB congeners (PCB153, 28 PCB52, PCB118, and PCB138) on cellular morphologies and synaptic transmission linked to 29 the proper execution of a sensorimotor response in zebrafish, taking advantage of the well-30 established neural circuit in this model
 Specifically, we imaged hair cells, neurons, and 31 muscle tissue to evaluate their presence and morphology
 We measured neurotransmitter 32 levels in larvae and assessed the mechanosensory startle response in co-exposures to 33 PCB153 and neurotransmitter modulators to evaluate the involvement of neurotransmitters 34 in the behavioral response
 The startle response was also assessed in dioxin-like (DL)-35 Results: Startle responses were dramatically delayed in 6-day old larvae exposed to NDL-37 PCB
 In contrast, exposure to the DL PCB126 did not delay startle response times
 38 Morphological and biochemical data showed that exposure to NDL-PCBs during 39 development induces swelling of afferent sensory neurons and disrupts dopaminergic and 40 and processing of sensory stimuli occur at low concentrations of NDL-PCBs, similar to those 43 present in human and animal samples
 The effects on important and broadly conserved 44 signaling mechanisms in vertebrates suggest that NDL-PCBs can contribute to 45  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25, 
 ;    Humans and wildlife are exposed to a wide range of contaminants in the environment, and 49 the role of these chemical pollutants in developmental neurotoxicity, cognitive impairment, 50 and neurodegenerative disorders has become a global environmental health concern 51 (Landrigan et al )
 Among the top industrial chemicals thought to be involved in 52 2014), a mix of 209 different structures, including planar dioxin-like (DL) congeners and non-54 planar non-dioxin-like (NDL) congeners
 PCBs are persistent legacy contaminants that have 55 been produced and used for decades to serve as insulators, coatings, and caulks, and there 56 is worldwide PCB contamination of wildlife tissue and human cord blood, amniotic fluid, and 57 mother's milk (Ennaceur et al 2008; Lancz et al a)
 The developing nervous system is 58 generally sensitive to chemical exposure at doses much lower than those affecting adult 59 nervous system function (Rice and Barone )
 For instance, prenatal exposure to PCBs 60 is associated with a decrease in motor skills in infants, while postnatal exposure seems to 61 have no obvious effects (Ribas-Fit et al )
 Thus, identifying the mechanisms 62 underpinning the effects of neurotoxic PCBs during gestation and early life stages is of 63 critical importance in attaining successful treatments and remediating health effects in 64 The NDL-PCBs are the most abundant congeners in human and environmental samples
 66 The NDL-PCB138 and PCB153, are particularly abundant
 Median PCB153 concentrations 67 measured in human cord blood serum range from 
4 to 110 ng g-1 lipid (Bergonzi et al 68 2009; Herbstman et al 2007; Lancz et al 2015b), far greater than the levels of DL 69 congeners
 Evidence also suggests the NDL-PCBs contribute substantially to neurotoxic and 70 behavioral effects (Boix et al 2010; Boucher et al )
 However, understanding of the 71 mechanisms and effects of NDL-PCBs, especially during the more sensitive early stages of 72  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25, 
 ;    Increased serum PCB concentrations in children are associated with deficits in cochlear 74 functions (Jusko et al 2014; Trnovec et al 2010), fine motor skills (Walkowiak et al 2001), 75 and cognitive impairment (Boucher et al 2009; Chen et al )
 Developmental exposure 76 of rats to NDL-PCBs has been linked to behavioral changes, including hyperactivity, 77 impulsiveness, and impairment of cognitive function (e
 g
, impairment of the ability to learn 78 the Y maze task) (Berger et al 2001; Boix et al 2010; Johansen et al )
 NDL-PCB 79 developmental exposure also adversely affects auditory function in adult rats, including 80 elevated thresholds of brainstem auditory evoked potentials, auditory deficits at low 81 frequencies, audiogenic seizures, and reduced auditory startle responses (Crofton et al 82 2000; Goldey et al 1995; Lilienthal et al 2011, 2015; Poon et al )
 The mechanism(s) 83 involved in these effects on cognitive and auditory systems are not known
 84 Zebrafish are increasingly used as model organism to uncover the mechanisms of 85 neurotoxicity that are relevant for humans and other vertebrates
 Zebrafish remain 86 transparent throughout early development, facilitating the use of transgenic and other 87 molecular approaches to label and observe specific classes of neurons and to follow their 88 functional development
 Fish have relatively simple neural circuits, particularly for the 89 auditory system
 In fish, the auditory-evoked startle response plays a critical role in animal 90 neurotransmitters that are conserved among vertebrates (Stewart et al )
 Many of the 92 pathways and genes that regulate zebrafish startle behavior also operate in human 93 neurological disorders (Howe et al 2013; Maximino and Herculano 2010; Meserve et al 94 2020; Tropepe and Sive 2003; Wolman et al )
 In this study, we use the zebrafish 95 startle response to decipher the neuro-disruptive basis of NDL-PCBs on the auditory system 96 during the early stages of development
 To this end, we examined the effects of different 97 NDL-PCBs (PCB153, PCB52, PCB118, PCB138), in comparison to the DL-PCB126 and at 98 different environmentally relevant concentrations, dissecting various steps in the neural 99  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25, 
 ;    In addition to other attributes, zebrafish have relatively simple neural circuits, particularly for 103 the auditory system
 Many of the components of the auditory circuit are homologous in 104 mammals and fish, including hair cells, neural transmission, and lower motorneurons, while 105 the mechanosensory lateral line system and Mauthner (M) cells are exclusively found in fish 106 and a cochlea is only found in mammals
 In fish, vibro-acoustic stimuli are first sensed by the 107 hair cell bundles in the auditory, vestibular, and lateral-line systems and rapidly encoded into 108 trains of action potentials in the afferent neurons (Figure 1) (Hudspeth )
 The signal 109 detected through the sensory hair cells of the lateral line is transmitted through the anterior 110 and posterior lateral line ganglia whereas the auditory input is transmitted through the VIIIth 111 statoacoustic nerve, all of which synapse to the lateral dendrite of the M-cell and two 112 segmental homologs (Nakayama 2004; Pujol-Mart and Lpez-Schier )
 The signal is 113 propagated down the M-cell axon in the spinal cord to activate the motoneurons leading to a 114 Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were maintained at 
5 C and on a 12:12 h light-dark cycle 117 according to the guidelines of the Zebrafish Model Organism Database (ZFIN,  118 and institutional guidelines at WHOI and the experimental procedures approved by the 119 Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ID Number BI
 )
 Adult zebrafish were 120 fed brine shrimp and pellets every day
 In this study, we used wild-type zebrafish of the AB 121 strain obtained from Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC), as well as several 122 USA), and the transgenic lines Tg(cntn1b:EGFP-CAAX) (Panlilio et al 2021) labeling axons, 125 Tg(olig2:EGFP)vu12 (Park et al 2007; Shin et al 2003) marking oligodendrocyte precursor 126 cell bodies, Tg(sox10:mRFP) (Takada et al 2010) marking oligodendrocyte lineage cells, as 127  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25,

 Charles Kaufman in the laboratory of Dr
 Leonard Zon, Harvard 129 Medical School, Boston, MA) marking myelin sheaths
 Zebrafish eggs were obtained by 130 pairwise breeding and kept in 
3x Danieau's (17 mM NaCl, 
2 mM KCl, 
12 mM MgSO4, 131 
18 mM Ca(NO3)2 and 
5 mM HEPES, pH 
6) in glass vials at a density of 10 individuals 132 per 10 mL, at a constant water temperature of 28  1C and standard 14-h light/10-h dark 133 cycle
 The medium was supplemented with 1-Phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU, 
003% w/v) from 24 134 hours post-fertilization (hpf) onwards to prevent pigment formation when necessary for 135 imaging
 Fertilized eggs were used for exposures starting at 3 hpf to solvent control (
1% 136 exposure scenario with PCB153 was started at 24 hpf, to assess whether effects are 140 induced during or after initial neuronal cell differentiation
 Sensory neurons send their 141 projection along the ectoderm as early as 16 hpf (Kimmel )
 The lowest exposure 142 concentration for PCB153 was 10 nM (
6 ng mL-1) which is estimated to result in ~5 ng g-1 143 (5 ppm) per zebrafish larvae (comparing to PCB95 uptake levels; (Ranasinghe et al ))
 144 PCB153 mean concentrations found in maternal cord blood serum are 
27 ng mL-1 or 110 145 ng g-1 lipid (Lancz et al b))
 Other concentrations used were 30, 100, and 1000 nM 146 which are found in fish of contaminated ecosystems (Grns et al )
 For PCB52, 147 PCB118, and PCB138, a concentration of 1000 nM was chosen to compare to the highest 148 effect concentration of PCB
 The DL-PCB126 is cardioteratogenic in the low nanomolar 149 range
 To avoid malformations, a concentration of 1 nM was chosen
 Exposures were 150 refreshed daily until four days post-fertilization (dpf) and all larvae were kept in Danieau's 151 from 5 to 6 dpf
 All imaging and behavioral assays were performed at 6 dpf, except for the 152  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25, 
 ;    The influence of neurotransmitters on the startle behavior was assessed by exposures to 154 compounds known to interfere with monoamines
 At 6 dpf, larvae were evaluated for their 155 startle behavior and then immersed in the dopamine precursors L-DOPA (1 mM) or L-156 tyrosine (1 mM), dopamine receptor agonist quinpirole (10 M), dopamine D2-receptor 157 antagonist and GABA receptor modulator haloperidol (10 M), endogenous serotonin 5-HT 158 (10 M), and serotonin precursor 5-HTP (1 mM) for 30 min in the well plate before assessing 159 the startle behavior again
 Additionally, the effect of neurotransmitter modulation during 160 development on startle response was assessed by exposing larvae from 3 to 120 hpf to L-161 DOPA (1 mM), L-tyrosine (1 mM), and quinpirole (10 M)
  162 Larval locomotion was monitored using the Noldus Daniovison system (Noldus Information 164 Technology, Leesburg, VA, USA) using 6-dpf larvae distributed in 48-well plates (1 larva per 165 well)
 After an acclimation period of 40 minutes in the illuminated chamber, spontaneous 166 swimming activity was tracked for 10 minutes
 Following the spontaneous swimming, three 167 alternating cycles of dark and light conditions (10 minutes each) were run
 The experiment 168 was repeated three times with cohorts from separate breeding events (n = 24 per group and 169 breeding event)
 Video data were recorded with 30 frames per second via an infrared 170 camera
 Obtained data were analyzed with the supplied software EthoVision XT 12 171 The activity of Rohon-Beard sensory neurons was tested at 26 hpf by lightly touching 173 DMSO- and 1000 nM PCB153-exposed embryos (n = 10 per group and breeding event) 174 using a piece of fishing line affixed to a glass pipette
 Each embryo was touched ten times 175 and the response was scored as follows: 0, no response; 
5, light tail flicking response, 1, 176 coiling in the opposite direction of the touch stimulus, yielding a score of maximum 10 per 177 embryo
 The experiment was repeated twice with cohorts from separate breeding events

 ;    Vibro-acoustic startle response was assessed as described previously (Panlilio et al )
 179 Briefly, the acoustic stimuli were delivered by a vibrational exciter producing acoustic 180 vibrations at a frequency of a 1000 Hz for a duration of 2 ms at four different amplitudes (32, 181 38, 41, 43 dB)
 For each amplitude, the stimulus was delivered four times, spaced 20 182 seconds apart, to a 4 x 4 well-plate mounted on top of the speaker, each well containing an 183 individual larva
 The response was tracked with a high-speed camera (Edgertronic SC1) at 184 1000 frames s-1 for 250 ms (13 ms before and 237 ms after the stimulus)
 PulsePal was used 185 to synchronize the camera recording to the acoustic stimuli using a TTL pulse
 Automated 186 analysis of larval movement kinematics (response frequency, latency, turning angle) was 187 performed using the FLOTE software package (Burgess and Granato )
 Each treatment 188 group was assessed at least three times with eggs from different clutches
 The total replicate 189 A startle response in fish can be executed with a short latency C-bend (SLC) or long latency 191 C-bend (LLC), with the SLC being the more frequent response at higher stimulus intensities
 192 The cut-off time between SLC and LLC can vary depending on environmental conditions 193 such as temperature and has been determined empirically for this experiment using a 194 Gaussian mixture model (Panlilio et al 2020)(Figure S)
 Responses within 15 ms were 195 categorized as SLC, latencies greater than 15 ms as LLC
 Following this classification, the 196 median response type (Relative Startle Bias) for each responsive fish was determined for 197 each stimulus intensity (32, 38, 41, and 43 dB)
 Bias per individual fish was calculated as: 198 (frequency of SLC  frequency of LLC) / total responses
 Pure SLC responses result in a 199 value of +1, while pure LLC responses are a value of -1 (Jain et al )
 200 Electric field pulses (EFPs) directly activate the M-cells (Tabor et al )
 Responsiveness 201 of M-cells was assessed by applying EFPs (
4 V cm-1 for 2 ms, square pulse) to head-202 restrained larvae (n = 46 per treatment group)
 Seven consecutive EFPs were applied with a 203 recovery time of 20 s in between pulses
 For each run, one control and one exposed larva 204 were embedded in 
5% agarose side-by-side and their tails freed

 For all behavioral assays, only larvae 206 Larval length (from snout to the tail-fin end) was measured in DMSO (n = 57) and 1000 nM 209 PCB153 (n = 51) exposed larvae using ImageJ
 The experiment was performed three times 210 pyridinium dibromide; Invitrogen) specifically labels hair cells in the lateral line and inner ear 214 of vertebrates of by entering through open mechanotransduction channels and filling the 215 cytoplasm of hair cells (Meyers et al )
 At 6 dpf, zebrafish larvae of 1000 nM PCB153-216 exposed (n = 32) and unexposed (n = 28) groups were immersed in Danieau's 217 supplemented with 3 M FM1-43 for 30 s, rinsed three times in Danieau's, anesthetized in 1 218 mM 3-amino-benzoic acid (Tricaine), and mounted in 
5% low melting agarose for confocal 219 imaging of the L3 neuromast
 The experiment was performed three times independently
 220 Whole-mount immunohistochemistry of zebrafish larvae and brains was performed following 222 standard procedures
 Briefly, 10 AB larvae per exposure group were treated as described 223 above and subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS overnight at 4 C
 For 224 labelling brain tissue, larval brains were dissected before continuing with the protocol
 225 Multiple rinsing steps in PBS containing either 
5% Triton-X100 or 
1% Tween-20 (PBST) 226 for larvae or brains, respectively, was followed by an antigen retrieval step in 150 mM Tris 227 HCl (pH 
0) at 70 C (Inoue and Wittbrodt 2011), and a permeabilization step using 228 proteinase K (10 g/mL for 3 minutes)
 Subsequently, the samples were blocked in blocking 229 solution (10% Normal Goat Serum, 1% DMSO, 1% BSA, 88% PBST) for 1 h and then 230 stained with blocking solution supplemented with the primary antibody for three days at 4 C

 The anti-5HT rabbit polyclonal 234 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, #S5545, 1:500) was used to label serotonergic cells (DMSO n = 16, 235 PCB153 n = )
 The anti-acetylated alpha-tubulin mouse polyclonal antibody (Sigma-236 Aldrich, #T6793, 1:1000 dilution) was used to label kinocilia and hair cell innervating neurons 237 (DMSO n = 25, PCB153 n = )
 After several washing steps, in PBST, the samples were 238 incubated with Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-conjugated goat-anti-mouse or goat-anti-rabbit 239 secondary antibodies (Abcam, 1:500 dilution) overnight at 4 C and rinsed several times in 240 PBST before mounting in ProLong Diamond Antifade mountant (Invitrogen) for imaging
 For 241 visualization of skeletal muscle fibers (DMSO n = 11, PCB153 n = 11), larvae were fixed as 242 above, followed by permeabilization in 5% Triton-X for overnight and incubation in phalloidin 243 Alexa-546 conjugate (Invitrogen, :)
 All staining experiments were repeated three times 244 with larvae from independent clutches except the phalloidin staining, which were performed 245 Imaging of hair cell innervating neurons, primary motoneuron, and oligodendrocyte 247 The Tg(cntn1b:EGFP-CAAX) transgenic line was used to image the cell bodies of neurons 249 that innervate the hair cells at the L3 position in the lateral line (DMSO n = 22, PCB153 n = 250 20, two independent experiments)
 The axons of the main caudal primary motoneurons were 251 visualized using the Tg(olig2:EGFP) transgenic line (n = 4 per treatment group, one 252 experiment)
 The double transgenic Tg(olig2:EGFP) x Tg(sox10:mRFP) was used to quantify 253 oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the spinal cord of in DMSO (n = 22) and 1000 nM PCB153 254 (n = 16) treated larvae (Shin et al )
 All larvae were anesthetized in tricaine (

 The experiments were performed three times 258 Neuronal activity in DMSO- and PCB153-treated larvae was visualized using the CaMPARI 261 (elavl3:CaMPARI) transgenic zebrafish line with an engineered fluorescent protein that 262 permanently photoconverts from green to red in the presence of elevated calcium and UV 263 light (Fosque et al )
 Photoconversion was achieved by mounting an LED light (405 nm; 264 LEDSupply) between the speaker and a custom-made 3-well plate containing the freely 265 swimming larvae (DMSO- and PCB-treated)
 Larvae of the same treatment were divided 266 into two batches: one was photoconverted in medium at room temperature (RT) and the 267 other one at 4C to elicit high neuronal activity
 Photoconversion was achieved by shining the 268 LED light for 10 sec either with one vibrational stimulus of 43 dB at the start or without 269 stimulus
 Subsequently, larvae were anesthetized, embedded in agarose, and whole brains 270 imaged using the 10x objective

 The experiment was performed once (n = 4 per treatment group)
 316 All statistical analyses were conducted using Graph Pad Prism 
4 except some of the startle 318 behavior analysis, which was completed in R
 All quantitative data were tested for normality 319 using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and if there were unequal number of subjects between groups, 320 the data were tested for homogeneity in variances using the Brown-Forsythe test
 All 321 Responsiveness to auditory stimuli (response or not) and startle type (SLC vs
 LLC) was 323 modeled in R (version 
 
2) using a binomial generalized linear mixed effect model (glmer() 324 from the lme4 R package) (Bates et al )
 The response to electrical stimulus was 325 modeled using glm() from the lme4 R package
 For the auditory response, we included 326 treatment as a fixed effect and the replicate experimental trials as a random effect
 The 327 model specification for fraction responding was as follows: Responders ~ TreatmentGroup 328 + (TreatmentGroup|trial)
 The model specification for startle bias was as follows: 329 SLCorLLCresponse ~ TreatmentGroup + stimdB + (|trial)
 The data were analyzed fitting 330 the model for each stimulus intensity independently

 For non-normal data with three or more groups 338 (SLC bend angle), a Kruskal-Wallis followed by the Dunn's multiple comparison test was 339 performed
 For normal data with two groups (length, mean latency, bend angle in e-stim, 340 oligodendrocyte lineage cell count, 5-HT intensity), an unpaired two-tailed t-test with Welch's 341 correction (Welch's t- test) was performed
 The nonparametric scoring data of the touch 342 assay and latency in e-stim was analyzed using a two-tailed Mann-Whitney test
 The data 343 are presented as meanSD with single data points (replicates) superimposed on the graph 344 The startle response circuit is of wide relevance and well-established for assessing the 347 influence of specific factors on neuronal cell development, neuromuscular connectivity, and 348 transmission (Burgess and Granato 2007; Medan and Preuss 2014; Meserve et al 2020; 349 Panlilio et al )
 We used the startle response circuit to assess the effects of NDL-PCBs 350 on the formation of neuronal populations and neurotransmission and its consequences for 351 Rohon-Beard cells are the earliest mechanosensory neurons that develop
 They are located 354 in the dorsal region of the embryonic spinal cord and appear around 24 hpf (Roberts )
 355 A few days into development, Rohon-Beard cells also relay sensory information to the M-356 cells (Liu and Hale )
 In our experiments, a tactile stimulus on the trunk at 26 hpf evoked 357 a C-shaped body flexion in both the DMSO- and the 1000 nM PCB153-treated embryos (U = 358 183, p =

 ;    Exposure to contaminants during development can result in reduced growth, which can 361 affect kinematics in swimming behavior (Voesenek et al )
 PCB153-exposed larvae 362 developed normally with no difference in body length on day six in comparison to the control 363 group, in all three trials (Trial 1: t(
98) = 
661, p = 
514; Trial 2: t(

 At 6 dpf, spontaneous and light-dark-stimulated 365 swimming activity was assessed
 Larvae exposed to PCB 153 (1000 nM) had lower 366 cumulative locomotion activity over ten minutes (M = 1182 mm, SD = 382) in comparison to 367 the control group (M = 1510 mm, SD = 402), t(

 368 Zebrafish larvae typically increase locomotion in dark conditions following light exposure
 369 Once stimulated with a rapid loss of illumination during the dark phase, both treatment 370 The vibro-acoustic startle response can be executed either rapidly, within 15 ms (short 372 latency C-bend; SLC), or beginning at longer times and extending for up to 100 ms (long 373 latency C-bend; LLC)
 The mean latency value, representing the population response 374 including SLC and LLC responses, was 21  20 ms for control larvae at the highest stimulus 375 intensity (Figure S1, Figure 2A, B)
 By contrast, the NDL-PCB-treated larvae that 376 responded to the vibro-acoustic stimulus showed significantly longer average latencies in 377 response to the same auditory stimulus given the controls, F(5, 907 = 
61, p < 
 )
 378 PCB153-treated (1000 nM) larvae responded at a mean latency of 68  32 ms, PCB138 at 379 52  37 ms, PCB118 at 45  27 ms, and PCB52 at 39  32 ms
 For PCB153, a dose-380 dependent response was observed, with mean latencies increasing with dose (10 nM: 26  381 27 ms, 30 nM: 50  36 ms, 100 nM: 50  30 ms, 1000 nM: 68  32 ms)
 The lowest PCB153 382 concentration tested (10 nM) was not significantly different from controls
 Unlike NDL-PCB 383 treated larvae, the DL-PCB126-treated larvae had a mean latency (22  22 ms), which was 384 Examining the SLC and LLC responses separately can give insight into the underlying 386 mechanism of effect
 A greater stimulus intensity increases the probability of evoking SLC, 387  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25, 
 ;    shifting the response bias from LLC to SLC (Troconis et al )
 Here, we also observed a 388 shift to SLC with increasing stimulus intensity in solvent control (DMSO-treated) larvae 389 (Figure 2C, Figure SA)
 Larvae were tested four times at each stimulus intensity; thus, a 390 larva is categorized as having SLC bias if it responded 3 or 4 times out of 4 stimuli with an 391 SLC
 At the highest stimulus intensity that we tested (43 dB), the majority of control larvae 392 (300/448) responded with a SLC within 7  3 ms
 43 larvae showed no bias towards SLC or 393 LLC (2 times SLC and 2 times LLC, bias = )
 Those that did not perform an SLC (n = 105) 394 exhibited an LLC with a mean latency of 54  29 ms (Figure C)
 In contrast, all NDL-PCB-395 treated larvae (except for 10 nM PCB153) retained a response bias towards LLC at all 396 stimulus intensities tested, which was significantly different from the control (p < 
001 for all 397 stimulus intensities)
 Lowering the PCB153 dose gradually increased the shift towards SLC, 398 yet 10 nM PCB153 was still significantly different from the control (p <
01 for all stimulus 399 intensities)
 Exposures starting after many structures of the brain and the neural tube have 400 developed, at 24 hpf (Smith and Kimelman 2019), had the same effect on startle latency 401 The proportion of control larvae responding to the stimulus (either SLC or LLC) increased 403 from 
2  
0% (n = 450) to 
8  
0% (n = 457) from the lowest to highest stimulus 404 intensity, whereas the proportion of NDL-PCB153-, PCB138-, and PCB52-treated larvae that 405 responded remained below 70% (except for 10 nM PCB153) at all intensities and were 406 significantly different (p < 
01) from the control (Figure 2D, Figure SA)
 In contrast to those 407 exposed to NDL-PCBs, the larvae exposed to the DL-PCB126 and NDL-PCB118 had a 408 The different startle response bends exhibit different kinematics, with SLCs exhibiting larger 410 bend angles and faster angular velocities than LLCs (Burgess and Granato )
 Thus, 411 LLC and SLC kinematics were analyzed separately
 PCB52-treated larvae had increased 412 SLC bend angles (p > 
0001) at two intermediate stimulus intensities (38 and 41 dB) while 413 PCB126 larvae had increased SLC bend angles at the three highest stimulus intensities 414  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25, 
 ;    (Figure S)
 Furthermore, PCB153 (1000 nM) exposure resulted in an increased SLC bend 415 angle at the highest stimulus intensity for those few larvae that exhibited an SLC (n = 26 of 416 138, 43 dB, p < 
 )
 LLC bend angle was significantly decreased across all stimulus 417 intensities for PCB
 It is not clear how bend angle is associated with altered signaling and 418 The proper execution of the startle response relies on hair cells that sense the auditory 421 stimulus, M-cells to integrate the signals, and motor neurons and musculature to execute the 422 startle behavior
 Morphological analysis showed that M-cells, motor neurons, and 423 musculature all appeared unaffected by PCB153, but the hair cell innervating neurons 424 appeared to be swollen (Figure )
 The L3 neuromast volume of control larvae was on 425 average 569 m3 (SD = 125), whereas PCB153-exposed larvae (1000 nM) had significantly 426 larger L3 neuromast volumes 848 m3 (SD = 185), t(
93) = 
765, p < 
0001 (Figure B)
 427 However, the number of hair cells in L3 neuromasts (Figure 3C) and the intensity of FM1-43 428 dye internalized by hair cells (Figure 3D) remained unchanged in PCB153-treated larvae in 429 The presence of M-cells is necessary for the SLC startle response
 Staining with anti-3A10 431 confirmed the presence of M-cells in all PCB153-exposed larvae (21/21) (Figure A)
 We 432 tested the functional responsiveness of the M-cells by applying electric field pulses to head-433 restrained larvae
 This electrical stimulation bypasses the sensory system and directly 434 activates the M-cell (Tabor et al )
 There was no difference detected in response time 435 between control and 1000 nM PCB153-exposed larvae (U = 
5, p = 
489), demonstrating 436 that the signal transmission from the M-cell to the motor neurons is not disrupted in PCR153-437 exposed fish (Figure SA)
 The fraction responding also was similar in both the DMSO-438 treated (290/299) and the PCB153-treated (209/219) groups (GLM, p = 
427; Figure 4C, 439 Figure SB)
 However, the C-bend evoked by the electrical stimulation was larger in 440 PCB153-exposed larvae (M = 
4, SD = 
60) than in the control larvae (M = 
12, SD = 441  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25,

 )
 An unpaired t-test with Welch-s correction indicated that this difference was 442 statistically significant, t(
27) = 
679, p =
0091 (Figure SC)
 This difference could 443 indicate a PCB153-evoked functional alteration of the M-cell axon or motor neuron
  444 For rapid and effective axonal signal transmission, proper myelination of axons is key
 We 445 did not find PCB153 to reduce cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage in the spinal cord, (t(36) = 446 
553, p < 
584) nor any obvious differences in myelination itself (Figure S)
 447 Proper function and activation of the motor neurons is crucial for completion of the startle 448 circuit, leading to muscle contractions and the characteristic swimming behaviors
 The main 449 caudal primary (CaP), middle primary (MiP), and rostral primary (RoP) motor neurons did not 450 show any distinct structural differences between exposed and control larvae (Figure S)
 451 The fast muscle fibers in the myotome were not found to be differentially striated in either 452 treatment groups (Figure S)
 No structural difference in the motor neurons or the 453 myotome was apparent in PCB153-exposed larvae, suggesting that the increased bend 454 angle does not originate from any overt structural differences in the motor neurons or muscle 455 The release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft is a characteristic process in signal 458 transmission
 Both serotonergic and dopaminergic neuromodulators can affect startle latency 459 (Jain et al 2018), and evidence has been found that NDL-PCBs alter these neuromodulators 460 in mammals (e
 g
 Castoldi et al 2006; Enayah et al 2018; Wigestrand et al )
 We 461 observed that PCB153 (1000 nM) altered the levels of several neurotransmitters in 6 dpf 462 zebrafish larvae (Figure A)
 Significantly increased level of GABA (t(6) = 
719, p < 
001), 463 choline-chloride (t(6) = 
459, p < 
001), 3-methoxytyramine hydrochloride (t(6) = 
803, p = 464 
009), and L-valine (t(6) = 
134, p = 
020) were measured in PCB-exposed larvae in 465 comparison to control larvae; while L-Glutamine was decreased in comparison to control 466  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25, 
 ;    To assess the interaction between PCB-exposure and changes in neuromodulatory activity, 468 and GABA receptor agonists and antagonists
 In control larvae, a 30 min exposure to 470 dopamine precursor L-DOPA and D2-receptor agonist Quinpirole, as well as serotonin 471 precursor 5-HTP, shifted the response to LLC, at multiple intensities tested (p < 
01; Figure 472 C)
 In contrast, the dopamine antagonist haloperidol exposure induced a shift to SLC in 473 controls across all stimulus intensities (p < 
01; Figure C)
 Haloperidol induced the same 474 shift to SLC in PCB153-exposed larvae (p < 
001), suggesting that the startle circuit is 475 functional but repressed by PCB (Figure C)
 The response rate remained unchanged after 476 exposure to neurotransmitter modulators except 5-HT, which caused an increase in 477 response probability across all stimulus intensities in control larvae (p < 
01); Quinpirole, 478 which caused a decrease in response probability at the two lowest stimulus intensities in 479 control larvae (p < 
01); and Haloperidol, which caused an increase in response probability at 480 41 dB in PCB153-treated larvae (p < 
01; Figure S)
 It is noteworthy, that co-exposure to L-481 DOPA and PCB153 throughout development increased the response rate of PCB153-treated 482 larvae significantly (p < 
01), yet only induced a significant shift towards SLC at 38 dB (p < 483 In the fish brain, a distinct population of serotonergic neurons is found in the posterior 485 tuberculum/hypothalamus, forming a prominent horseshoe-like pattern that is one of several 486 brain regions where 5-HT is synthesized (Oikonomou et al )
 To assess whether the 487 development of serotonergic cells in the brain of PCB153 larvae was affected, we performed 488 immunohistochemistry using an antibody for 5-HT (Figure S)
 The intensity of the 489 fluorescent signal in the hypothalamus was not different, comparing PCB153 (M = 
70 x 490 106, SD = 
10 x 106) with the control (M = 
38 x 106, SD = 
1 x 105) group
 This suggests 491 that the serotonergic neurons in this region were not affected
 492 During specific behaviors or sensory experiences, only a small percentage of neurons are 493 active
 We analyzed the active neuronal cell populations in PCB153-treated and -untreated 494  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25, 
 ;    larvae, focusing on the rostral hindbrain, where the M-cells are located, to assess whether 495 there were changes in neural activity
 We examined neuronal activity using the CaMPARI 496 zebrafish line, which contains a protein that upon UV illumination permanently photoconverts 497 from green to red fluorescence in cells with high calcium levels (Fosque et al )
 This 498 genomic tool enabled us to look for active neuronal cell populations in larvae during normal 499 swimming movement, and in larvae experiencing a vibroacoustic stimulated startle response, 500 both in embryo medium at room temperature (24 C), and at a colder temperature (4 C)
 A 501 higher red to green ratio (Fred/Fgreen) was measured comparing cold medium with room 502 temperature medium: swimming control larvae in cold medium had a higher Fred/Fgreen ratio 503 (M = 
30, SD = 
51) in comparison to swimming control larvae at RT (M = 
96, SD = 504 
17), confirming the potential of cold medium to elicit higher neuronal activity (Figure S)
 505 However, this difference was diminished in PCB153-treated, yet still significant in trial 1: F(1, 506 18) = 121, adj

 509 Similar differences in neuronal activity between control and PCB-153 treated larvae were 510 Despite most use ending decades ago, PCBs remain an important and persistent pollutant 513 impacting both wildlife and humans
 To date, mechanistic studies of neurodevelopmental 514 effects of NDL-PCBs suggest two major targets: (1) alterations in neurotransmission, 515 particularly involving dopamine and serotonin, and consequently disruptions to Ca2+ signal 516 transduction (Campagna et al 2011; Dervola et al 2015; Enayah et al 2018; Fonnum and 517 Mariussen 2009; Langeveld et al 2012), and (2) loss of outer hair cells (Crofton et al 2000; 518 Trnovec et al 2010) or cochlear development (Goldey et al )
 However, such studies 519 have not addressed how PCBs exert developmental neurobehavioral deficits, and thus we 520  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25, 
 ;    do not know whether neurobehavioral disorders resulting from prenatal exposure originate in 521 a structural effect in the auditory system, a neurotransmitter imbalance, or both
 In this study 522 we used the zebrafish startle response to comprehensively investigate the effects of different 523 PCBs on neuron development and signal transmission and to assess effects at 524 environmentally relevant concentrations for both humans and aquatic life
 All NDL-PCBs 525 delayed the acoustic startle response in zebrafish larvae, which coincided with axonal 526 swelling and dysregulated GABA and dopamine metabolite levels
 Co-exposures to the 527 dopamine D2-receptor antagonist and GABA receptor modulator drug haloperidol, alleviated 528 The morphology of the neuronal cell body (perikarya) and neurite provides essential 530 information on the developmental and physiological abnormalities in the neural circuits
 We 531 found that in PCB153-exposed larvae, the neurons that innervate the hair cells had an 532 increased volume (Figure 3), indicating that PCB153 alters neuronal structure and hair cell 533 function
 Swelling of afferent terminals is associated with hearing deficits in both mammalian 534 models (Puel et al 1991) and zebrafish (Sebe et al )
 The increased volume may 535 originate from increased numbers of bulged (swollen) afferent neurite termini or increased 536 arborization (branching)
 For example, tmie mutant zebrafish, which are deaf with defective 537 hair-cell function (Gleason et al 2009), have more complex peripheral arbors in afferent 538 axons and an increased number of neurites
 In wildtype zebrafish, neurites with swollen 539 axonal terminals are associated with hair cells of both polarities rather than just a single 540 polarity, suggesting a dysregulation of selection in synaptic targets (Faucherre et al )
 541 At the sub-cellular level, neuronal swelling is due to increased cationic permeability in 542 neurons, causing an osmotic imbalance that leads to water entry and cytotoxic edema 543 (Rungta et al )
 While we examined a number of morphological features of the startle 544 circuit anatomy (hair cell, afferent neurons, M-cell, oligodendrocyte lineage cells, 545 myelination, motor neuron, muscle), only the volume of the neurons that innervate the hair 546 cells showed a measurable deviation in PCB153-exposed larvae
 We thus infer that the 547  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25, 
 ;    enlargement of axon termini is contributing to the neurotoxic potential of NDL-PCBs  an 548 understudied target of PCB toxicity
 A few studies associate NDL-PCB exposure with altered 549 dendritic arborization (Lein et al 2007; Yang et al )
 Axonal swelling is a pathology 550 appearing in many neurodegenerative disease (Coleman 2005), and exposure to NDL-PCBs 551 The startle response in fish and amphibians is a fundamental mechanism involved in 553 predator escape
 Acoustic stimuli can trigger two distinct motor behaviors: a short-latency C-554 bend (SLC; Figure 2A) initiated within 5-15 ms of the stimulus, or a long-latency C-bend 555 (LLC; Figure 2A), initiated within 15-100 ms (Burgess and Granato )
 At the structural 556 level, laser-ablation of the M-cell abolishes SLC responses without affecting LLC responses 557 (Lacoste et al 2015), suggesting that the LLC is a backup response (Burgess and Granato 558 )
 The finding that NDL-PCB-exposed larvae predominantly exhibit LLC without loss of 559 M-cells (Figure 4A), suggests that the M-cells are receiving a delayed input, are not firing 560 properly, or that the signal propagation downstream of the M-cell is disrupted
 To distinguish 561 these, we directly activated the M-cells by applying electrical stimulation to control larvae 562 with their heads restrained, and found that unlike auditory stimulation, PCB153-exposed fish 563 had latencies indistinguishable from the controls
 Furthermore, direct stimulation of PCB153-564 exposed larvae resulted in a normal response rate and response time, although the bend 565 angle was significantly increased
 These results indicate a proper function of M-cells in NDL-566 PCB-treated larvae
 However, the changes in bend angles we observed during these 567 There is less known about the mechanisms leading to an aberrant turning angle
 Since we 569 found no obvious structural impairment downstream of the M-cell (oligodendrocyte lineage 570 cells, myelination, motor neuron, musculature), we speculate that the increased bend angle 571 in electrically stimulated larvae exposed to PCB153 may be linked to a sub-cellular 572 disruption such as gap junctions
 It is known that PCBs can alter gap junction function in 573  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25, 
 ;    cells of many organs (Bager et al 1997; Kang et al 1996; Machala et al 2003) including 574 NDL-PCB specific inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication in neural crest cells 575 (Nyffeler et al 2018) and neuronal stem cells (PCB153; (Kang et al ))
 Gap junctions 576 are intercellular channels formed by connexins (Cx)
 RNA sequencing of zebrafish larvae 577 exposed to PCB153 in a similar exposure regime (4-120 hpf) and concentration (10 M) 578 significantly altered the expression of connexin genes cx
9, cx42, and cx35b (Aluru et al 579 )
 Cx35 is expressed on the Mauthner neuron lateral dendrites in zebrafish (Jain et al 580 2018) and plays a crucial role in regulating spinal motor activity during fast motor behavior of 581 adult mosquitofish (Serrano-Velez et al )
 We thus propose that gap junction function 582 could be disrupted, which may be a future study direction using single-cell RNA sequencing 583 or genetically encoded optogenetics that has yet to be developed in a model organism (Dong 584 Neurotransmitters also play a key role in the startle response
 A previous screening of more 586 modulators among the largest class of drugs that shift bias between SLC and LLC startle 588 behavior (Jain et al )
 Specifically, acute exposure to the D3R agonist (7OHD) shifted 589 the startle bias from LLC to SLC, while exposure to a D3R antagonist (or a 5-HT1AR 590 agonist) shifted bias toward LLC behavior (Jain et al )
 Our results extend these 591 findings, showing that 30 minutes exposure to L-DOPA or 5-HTP induces a shift from SLC to 592 LLC at higher stimulus intensities, as opposed to the D2R antagonist haloperidol, which 593 evoked a shift to a stronger SLC bias at all stimulus intensities (Figure C)
 NDL-PCBs are 594 thought to affect dopaminergic pathways (Mariussen and Fonnum 2001; Tanaka et al 2018; 595 Wigestrand et al 2013), which is partly supported by our measurements of catecholamines 596 and traces amines
 Specifically, we found that the extracellular dopamine metabolite 3-597 increased (Figure A)
 The interplay between dopamine and GABA receptors activity is 599 complex
 In the mammalian system, dopamine is a direct-acting modulator of GABAARs 600  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25, 
 ;    (Hoerbelt et al )
 The simultaneous presence of a dopamine metabolite and GABA in 601 PCB153-exposed zebrafish larvae may indicate that increased levels of GABA are a 602 downstream effect of dysregulated dopamine activity
 With both dopamine and GABA 603 playing critical roles in motor activity, we hypothesize that PCB153 impairs dopaminergic 604 neurotransmission and subsequently increases GABA levels, leading to the predominant 605 LLC response
 One of the most crucial regulators of synapse development and function 606 mediating the GABAergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic synaptic transmission is the brain 607 derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
 PCB153 induced the expression of bdnf in zebrafish 608 larvae (Aluru et al 2020) suggesting BDNF as potential target for transcriptional regulation
 609 Furthermore, we propose that GABA is involved in the swelling of the afferent terminals 610 (Figure 3) as GABA activates Cl- channels leading to an influx of Cl- accompanied by H2O 611 (Cesetti et al 2012; Rungta et al )
 The osmotic neuronal swelling alters neuronal 612 activity
 This study thus provides new evidence that GABA is involved in the neurobehavioral 613 mode of action of higher chlorinated NDL-PCBs, as has been for lower chlorinated 614 An important finding of this study is that PCB153-exposed larvae can execute SLC when 616 treated with haloperidol, a D2-antagonist that can increase dopamine turnover in acute 617 exposure (Magnusson et al )
 There is a large body of evidence showing that NDL-618 dopamine precursor enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine synthesis itself, in both 620 neural crest cells and adult laboratory animal models including non-human primates (Dervola 621 et al 2015; Enayah et al 2018; Fonnum and Mariussen 2009; Seegal et al )
 In 622 zebrafish larvae, PCB153 exposure during development elicited differential expression of 623 nine genes related to the dopamine pathway, including tyrosine hydroxylase 2 (th2) (Aluru et 624 al )
 Yet linking such effects to behavior is rare
 Tanaka et al (2018) suggested that the 625 NDL-PCB dominant mixture Aroclor 1254 and BDE-47 functionally inhibited dopaminergic 626  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25, 
 ;    neurons in early zebrafish embryos, as increased activity in 26 hpf embryos was inhibited by 627 supplementation with L-tyrosine and L-DOPA (Tanaka et al )
  628 The restoration of the delayed startle phenotype by haloperidol, together with the increased 629 levels of a dopamine metabolite and GABA in PCB153-exposed larvae (Figure 5A), 630 indicates that disruption of dopaminergic and GABAergic signaling between neurons of the 631 auditory circuit is the dominant effect of PCB153-mediated aberrant motor behavior
 These 632 signaling processes are widely conserved across vertebrate species, and are important in 633 human neurological diseases
 For example, a recent study found that multiple gene 634 mutations causing defective startle response in zebrafish were also associated with 635 disorders of the locomotor system in humans (Meserve et al )
  636 The localization of the PCB-induced disruption of dopaminergic signal transmission is likely 637 downstream of the hair cells, potentially in the hindbrain
 Although dopaminergic neurons 638 innervate lateral line neuromasts, where D1R antagonist reduces the hair cell activity (Toro 639 et al 2015), we found no difference in the hair cell activity of PCB153-exposed larvae 640 (Figure D)
 This is in contrast to the hindbrain, where neuronal activity was reduced in 641 PCB153 exposed CaMPARI zebrafish larvae (Figure 5), indicating a reduced capacity for 642 release or turnover of calcium
 Intracellular Ca2+ signaling in neurons controls 643 neurotransmitter secretion among many other cellular processes and thus may be indirectly 644 involved in dopamine or GABA regulation
 Some NDL-PCBs (PCB 95, 138) are known to 645 inhibit voltage-gated calcium channels (Langeveld et al 2012) contributing to interference 646 (Brunelli et al 2012; Campagna et al 2011; Gafni et al 2003; Ta et al )
 648 The startle response to threatening stimuli is vital for survival PCB153-exposed zebrafish 649 larvae predominantly responded with a LLC, which not only delays the response, increasing 650 the chance to be caught by a predator, but also usually does not displace the animal from its 651 original location (Figure 2A and Jain et al, )
 While survival of predator attack is likely 652  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 25, 
 ;    context-dependent and species-specific, escaping fast and away from a predator increases 653 survival in the field (McCormick et al )
 This suggests that exposure to NDL-PCBs may 654 alter selection pressure and thereby shift population structure
 We have observed a 655 significantly delayed startle response at concentrations as low as 10 nM (
6 g L-)
 PCBs 656 are associated with sediments, where concentrations of PCB153 frequently reach multiple 657 g kg-1 (Lai et al )
 PCB concentrations in organisms may be even higher due to 658 extensive bioconcentration (Killifish from New Bedford Harbor have 
5 to 7 g of PCB153 659 per g wet weight; Grns et al )
 All NDL-PCBs tested in this study increased the startle 660 latency
 Thus, in the environment, where PCBs occur in mixtures of numerous congeners 661 that likely have additive effects, the effect concentration is suggested to be lower than that of 662 single congeners
 Taken together, these results highlight the importance of the neurotoxic 663 In conclusion, the comprehensive approach presented here suggests that NDL-PCBs alter 665 dopamine signaling, leading to an increase in GABA that ultimately results in swelling of 666 axonal terminals in the auditory circuit
 While the involvement of connexins remains 667 speculative, our findings provide a foothold into the dopamine dysregulating potential of 668 NDL-PCBs in sensory-motor processing in developing vertebrates, and link that to motor 669 behavior
 In a direct comparison, the present study demonstrates that the adverse 670 behavioral effects are induced by all NDL-PCBs tested, but not by the classical DL-PCB
 671 Whether this is true for compounds that are structurally similar to NDL-PCBs, such as some 672 PBDEs, is not known and will require further research
 A key finding is that the effect of NDL-673 PCBs on the startle latency occurs at concentrations relevant for both environmental and 674 human exposures, and therefore may contribute to the selection pressure in the environment 675 and neurotoxicological disease in human
 This study provides valuable clues for tackling 676 health effects in humans and wildlife caused by environmental exposure
