 ;    Aims/hypothesis: Given the potential shared aetiology between type 1 and type 27 2 diabetes, we aimed to identify any genetic regions associated with both 28 diseases
 For associations where there is a shared signal and the allele that 29 increases risk to one disease also increases risk to the other, inference about 30 shared aetiology could be made, with the potential to develop therapeutic 31 strategies to treat or prevent both diseases simultaneously
 Alternatively, if a 32 genetic signal colocalises with divergent effect directions, it could provide 33 valuable biological insight into how the association affects the two diseases 34 Methods: Using publicly available type 2 diabetes summary statistics from a 36 individuals (74,124 cases and 824,006 controls) and type 1 diabetes GWAS 38 summary statistics from a meta-analysis of studies on individuals from the UK 39 and Sardinia (7,467 cases and 10,218 controls), we identified all regions of 
5 40 Mb that contained variants associated with both diseases (false discovery 41 rate<
 )
 In each region, we performed forward stepwise logistic regression to 42 type 1 diabetes signal with each type 2 diabetes signal using coloc
 Any 44 association with a colocalisation posterior probability of 
9 was considered a 45 Results: Of the 81 association signals from 42 genetic regions that showed 47 association with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, four association signals 48 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 In each of these regions, the effect of 54 genetic variants on type 1 diabetes was in the opposite direction to the effect on 55 type 2 diabetes

 ;    There is a genetic component to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with 87 approximately 60 chromosome regions associated with type 1 diabetes 1 and 88 over 200 associated with type 2 diabetes 2 at genomewide significance
 89 Examination of regions associated with both diseases could lead to uncovering 90 signals that simultaneously alter disease risk for both diseases, termed 91 effective for both diseases
 A recent analysis suggested that the same genetic 94 variant is altering risk of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in five regions, near 95 Anti-Estrogen Resistance Protein 1 (BCAR1), GLIS Family Zinc Finger Protein 3 97 Here, we identified all regions across the genome that showed evidence of 100 association to both type 1 and type 2 diseases at false discovery rate  (FDR) 101 <
01, and assessed colocalisation between the two diseases in each of these 102 regions
 Furthermore, to account for the possibility of multiple causal variants 103 within an associated region, we extended the analysis to investigate 104 any of the associations with one disease colocalised with any associations in the 106 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Genotypes were imputed using the Haplotype 115 Reference Consortium (HRC) reference panel for the UK collections 4, and a 116 custom Sardinian reference panel of 3,514 Sardinians for the Sardinian collection 117 Summary statistics for type 2 diabetes were from 74,124 cases and 824,006 119 controls of European ancestry, imputed using the HRC reference panel 
 120 Regions associated with both diseases were identified by selecting all variants 121 with type 1 diabetes and a type 2 diabetes association with FDR<

 In each such region, windows of approximately 
5 Mb 123 were taken to examine colocalisation (ESM - Regions associated with both 124 carried out for both diseases, and conditional summary statistics were obtained 126 so each conditionally-independent signal from both diseases could be tested 127 against each other for colocalisation (ESM - Conditional analyses)
  128 Colocalisation of signals was assessed using coloc 5, a Bayesian method that 129 enumerates the posterior probability that the association signals in a region are 130 shared between traits
 The prior probability of association with either disease 131 was taken to be 110-4 and the prior probability that the association signal is 132 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 The direction of effect was opposite, with the minor 150 A allele at the type 2 diabetes index variant, rs4929965 (G>A), associated with 151 susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (OR=

15, 162 We did not replicate the finding that the chromosome regions near CENPW, 164 GLIS3, BCL11A or THADA colocalised between type 1 and type 2 diabetes (H4PP 165 CENPW=
12, GLIS=
29, BCLA=
28, THADA not examined as no type 1 166 diabetes association existed in the region (FDR=
 ))
 To investigate these 167 discrepancies, we examined two other large type 2 diabetes meta-analyses: a 168 trans-ethnic study including 1,407,282 individuals 8 and a study of 433,540 169 individuals of East Asian ancestry 
 For the CENPW and BCL11A regions, the type 170 2 diabetes signal is consistent with at least one of the other GWAS studies 171 (measured by linkage disequilibrium (LD) in Europeans to the other study index 172 variants, ESM Table 4); and, the type 1 diabetes index variant is not in strong LD 173 (r<
41) with any of the index variants for type 2 diabetes across the three 174 GWAS studies
 However, at GLIS3, there appears to be a distinct signal in the 175 European study 2 compared to the trans-ethnic and East Asian type 2 diabetes 176 studies (r=
65), and the index variants from these two studies are in higher r2 177 with the type 1 diabetes signal in our analysis (r=
68), and even higher r2 with 178 the index variant from a larger T1D genetic analysis 1 (r=
99), indicating that 179 the signal near GLIS3 does colocalise between type 1 and type 2 diabetes with 180 concordant direction of effect, as previously identified

 ;    identified 42 regions that showed association with both type 1 and type 2 184 regions
 Four signals (near CTRB1/BCAR1, INS, TMEM129 and PGM1) colocalised 186 between the diseases, including a signal at the complex INS region for the first 187 However, in all four cases, the allele increasing risk for one disease was 189 protective against the other
 Examination of additional trans-ethnic and East 190 Asian type 2 diabetes genetic analyses, indicated that a fifth association, near 191 GLIS3, is likely to colocalise between diseases, with concordant direction of 192 Given the distinct mechanisms underlying -cell dysfunction and cell death 194 between the two diseases 11,  it is perhaps unsurprising that no additional signals 195 were detected with concordant direction of effect
 However, the type 1 diabetes 196 GWAS was much smaller than the type 2 diabetes analysis, and therefore had 197 less statistical power to detect more subtle genetic effects
 If a type 1 diabetes 198 GWAS were to be performed with similar power to the type 2 diabetes GWAS, 199 more regions might colocalise between the two diseases, but either the effects of 200 these additional regions on type 1 diabetes would be small compared to the 201 currently known associations, or they would be rare variants with larger effect 202 That four of five colocalisation signals had opposite directions of effect implies a 204 complex genetic relationship between the two diseases
 Whilst the directional 205 discordance offers little hope for effective treatments for both diseases 206 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    simultaneously at these particular targets, it can offer biological insight into the 207 disease pathways that these regions act upon, and even if there is directional 208 discordance, the genetics could be highlighting the same therapeutic target
  209 We did not replicate the findings that the associations near BCL11A, CENPW and 210 THADA colocalise between the two diseases 3, despite overlapping samples and 211 similar numbers of cases and controls in the type 1 diabetes GWAS
 This is likely 212 due to three reasons: i) the previous study 3 examined colocalisation using 213 weaker association signals, for example, the colocalisation near THADA was 214 based on a type 1 diabetes association p-value of 
01; ii) we used a more 215 stringent prior for colocalisation between the two diseases, as recently 216 suggested 6 (510-6 vs
 110-5); and iii) we used a more stringent posterior 217 probability threshold to declare colocalisation (
9 vs
 
 )
  Our increased 218 stringency compared to the previous analysis 3, whilst increasing the probability 219 that any identified shared signals will be true positives,  may have decreased our 220 sensitivity to detect all colocalisations
 For example, by examining other large 221 type 2 diabetes GWAS analyses and a larger type 1 diabetes genetic analysis, we 222 conclude that the association near GLIS3 likely does colocalise between the two 223 In conclusion, with current GWAS sample sizes, just five associations appear to 225 colocalise between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, four with opposing 226 direction of effect
 Larger sample sizes would be required to identify the depth of 227 genetically identified therapeutic targets to treat or prevent both diseases 228 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
