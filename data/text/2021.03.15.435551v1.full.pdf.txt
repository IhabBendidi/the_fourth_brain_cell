 ;    The papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a validated antiviral drug target
 PLpro is involved in the cleavage of viral polyproteins and antagonizing host innate a high profile antiviral drug target
 Through a FRET-based high-throughput screening, several hits were identified as PLpro inhibitors with IC50 values at the single-digit micromolar range
 Subsequent lead optimization led to potent inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 
56 to 
90 M
 To help prioritize lead compounds for the cellular antiviral assay against SARS-CoV-2, we developed the cell-based FlipGFP assay that is suitable for quantifying the intracellular enzymatic inhibition potency of PLpro inhibitors in the BSL-2 setting
 Two compounds selected from the FlipGFP-PLpro assay, Jun9-53-2 and Jun9-72-2, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Caco-2 hACE2 cells with EC50 values of 
89 and 
32 M, respectively, which were 3-fold more potent than GRL0617 showed that binding of GRL0617 to SARS-CoV-2 induced a conformational change in the BL2 loop to the more closed conformation
 Overall, the PLpro inhibitors identified in this study represent promising starting points for further development as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, and FlipGFP-PLpro assay might be a suitable surrogate for screening PLpro (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    The COVID-19 pandemic has led to 120,105,958 confirmed cases and 2,657,629 deaths as of March 15, 2021, rendering it the worst pandemic since the 1918 Spanish flu
 The etiological agent of COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus that belongs to the beta coronavirus family
 Two additional coronaviruses within the same family, the SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, have caused epidemics in humans with mortality rates of 
6% and 
3%, respectively
 Although SARS-CoV-2 has a lower mortality rate of 
2% compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it has led to far greater death tolls due to its higher transmission
 SARS-CoV-2 differs from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in that it has a long incubation time after the initial infection (~ 2 weeks), and a large percentage of infected patients continue to shed the virus while Johnson have been approved by FDA in the United States
 For small molecule antivirals, remdesivir received FDA approval on October 22, 
 Although the polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 has proof-reading function, it continues to mutate at a rate about 10-6 per site per cycle
1 Several mutant viruses have already emerged and widely circulated among humans since the beginning of the pandemic
2 Therefore, there is a dire need of additional antivirals with a novel mechanism of action
 Antivirals are not substituents of vaccines, but rather an important complement to help combat the pandemic
 Among the viral proteins that have been actively pursued as SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug targets, the main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) are the most promising ones

 ;    IC50 values of around 2 M and the SARS-CoV-2 viral replication with EC50 values In this study, we report our progress in developing novel SARS-CoV-2 PLpro screening against the Enamine 50K diversity compound library and identified two hits Jun9-13-7 and Jun9-13-9 with single-digit micromolar IC50 values
 Upon validating the hits using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) and native mass spectrometry binding assays, a focused library of structural analogs were designed and tested to dissect the inhibit SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with submicromolar potency
 To prioritize lead compounds for the antiviral assay against SARS-CoV-2, we developed the FlipGFP assay that is suitable for quantifying the intracellular activity of PLpro inhibitors in the BSL2 setting
 Two compounds selected from the FlipGFP PLpro assay, Jun9-53-2 and Jun9-72-2, showed 3-fold improvement than GRL0617 in the cellular antiviral assay against SARS-CoV-

 ;    Two constructs of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro were expressed in E
 Coli, one with Hig-tag (PLpro-His) and another without the tag (PLpro)
 To profile the proteolytic activity of PLpro in cleaving the viral polyprotein, we developed a FRET based enzymatic assay with the S1), respectively, which were similar to previous reports,8,17 suggesting both constructs were enzymatically active
 The SARS-CoV-2 PLpro was also reported to have and ISG-AMC substrates, respectively, in the enzymatic assay
 It was found that the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is more efficient in cleaving the ubiquitin (Ub) and ISG15 (ISG) modifications than the viral polyprotein, with kcat/Km values of 1,070 and 
x(Table S2), respectively
  This substrate preference is in agreement with results reported by Gal et al,17 and SARS-CoV PLpro was also reported to have similar substrate deubiquitinating activity, which is consistent with previous reports that the SARS-CoV-2 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

668 with a signal to noise ratio (S/B) of 
2, indicating that this was a robust assay (Fig
 )
 We then performed the HTS against the enamine library, which consists of 50,240 structurally diverse compounds
 GRL0617 was included as a Fig
 
 384-well high-throughput screening assay with SARS CoV-2 PLpro
 In this representative control plate (column 1 to 20 with PLpro protein, column 21 to 24 with buffer only; 1 l DMSO was added to column 1 to 10 and 21 to 24; 1 l GRL0617 was added to column 11 to 20), the signal to base ratio (S/B) is

 In comparison, GRL0617 had an IC50 value of

 The potency of GRL0617 in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 PLpro from our study is consistent with recent reports
6-9 The rest of the hits had weak enzymatic inhibition (IC50 > 10 M) and showed marginal binding to PLpro, therefore they were not further pursued (Table S)
 Both compound Jun9-13-7 and Jun9-13-9 also inhibit the deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities with IC50 values ranging from

 It was found that the hydroxyl substation at the left phenyl ring is critical for the activity as methylation led to significant loss of enzymatic inhibition (Jun9-13-9 vs Jun--)
 The methylene linker and the methyl substation on the link are both important for the substation on the right phenyl ring is critical for the activity (Jun9-13-7 vs Jun9-29-5; Jun9-13-7 vs Jun--)

 Nine compounds had IC50 values less than 1 M including Jun9-75-4 (IC50 =

 ;    One of the challenges in SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug discovery is that SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) pathogen, which limits the number of drug candidates that can be screened
 To help prioritize lead compounds for the antiviral assay with PLpro that is suitable for testing the intracellular activity of PLpro inhibitors in the BSL2 setting
 The advantages of cell-based PLpro assay over the FRET-based enzymatic assay include but not limited to: 1) it can eliminate compounds that either cytotoxic or membrane impermeable; 2) In contrast to the standard FRET-based assay, PLpro cleaves the substrate in the cell cytoplasm in the FlipGFP assay, which is a close mimetic of the viral polyprotein cleavage by PLpro in virus-infected cell
 It is known that cysteine proteases are susceptible to re-dox active compounds as well as non-specific alkylating chemicals such as ebselen
19,20 The FlipGFP PLpro assay is expected to rule out such promiscuous compounds as the substrate is cleaved under the reducing In the assay design, the 10th and 11th -strands from the GFP protein were separated from the rest of the GFP -barrel (-strands 1-9) (Fig
 A)
21,22 The 10th and 11th -strands were linked through the PLpro cleavage site and a heterodimerized coiled coils E/K
 In the absence of the PLpro, the 10th and 11th -strands are conformationally restrained and unable to associate with the GFP -barrel -
 When the cleavage site is digested by the PLpro, the 11th -strand can then flip its orientation and associate with GFP -barrel 1-9 together with the 10th -strand, leading to restoration of the green fluorescence signal (Fig
 A)
 A red fluorescent protein mCherry was included within the construct via a self-cleaving 2A peptide to act as the transfection control (Fig

 ;    the normalized ratio of green fluorescence signal over red fluorescence signal is proportional to the enzymatic activity of PLpro
 Cells transfected with FlipGFP-PLpro but without the PLpro showed no green fluorescence signal (Fig
 4C, 6th row), suggesting host proteases are unable to cleavage the PLpro substrate sequence, thereby eliminating the background signal interference
 A strong green fluorescence signal was observed only when there was a match between the cleavage site and the corresponding protease (Fig
 4C, 2nd and 7th rows)
 Specifically, little or no GFP signal was observed when the cells were transfected with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and a construct containing either the TEV cleavage site (FlipGFP-TEV) (Fig
 4C, 4th row) or the Mpro cleavage site (FlipGFP-Mpro) (Fig
 4C, 3rd row)
 Similarly, little or no GFP signal was observed when the cells were transfected with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and a construct containing the PLpro cleavage site (FlipGFP-PLpro) (Fig
 4C, 5th row)
 In contrast, strong green fluorescence signals were observed when the cells were transfected with PLpro and FlipGFP-PLpro (Fig
 4C, 7th row) or Mpro and FlipGFP-Mpro (Fig
 4C, 2nd row)
  With the established assay condition, we then screened nine most potent PLpro inhibitors with IC50 values less than 1 M from the FRET-based enzymatic assay (Fig
 )
 GRL0617 and GC376 were included as positive and negative controls, respectively
 The initial hit Jun9-13-9 was also included
 Compounds were added 3 h post transfection, and GFP and mCherry fluorescence signals were measured at 48 h post transfection using the Cytation 5 imager reader
 A dose dependent decrease of the GFP signal was observed with increasing concentrations of GRL0617 (Fig

 There are two monomers per asymmetric unit in the P21 space group
 Unambiguous electron density reveals GRL0617 binds to the S3-S4 subpockets of the PLpro active site in a noncovalent manner (Fig
 A)
 The naphthalene ring is positioned in the S4 site, where it forms hydrophobic interactions with Pro247 and Pro
 Upon ligand binding, Tyr268 flips towards the central domain of GRL0617 (Fig
 6B) to -stack with the naphthalene and benzene rings
 At the 1-napthalene position is a carbon stereocenter that is substituted with an (R) methyl group that sticks directly into the core of the S4 subpocket
 This stereocenter and the methyl group are nearly superimposable with the  and 1 carbons of the P4 leucine for the ISG15 substrate in the previously determined complex structure (Fig

23 The carboxamide nitrogen of GRL0617 serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor for the sidechain of Asp164, while the oxygen accepts a hydrogen bond from the mainchain amide of Gln
 The disubstituted benzene spans the central substrate channel, partially occupying the P5-P3 substrate mainchain binding site, where it forms -  interactions with the sidechains of Tyr268/Gln269, and the backbone amides of hydrophobic interactions with the S2 site, forcing Leu162 slightly outwards compared with the apo structure , while the meta-nitrogen orients towards the S5 site, causing Gln269 to swing inwards to accept a hydrogen bond

 OAc indicates an acetate molecule in the C111S mutant active site
     One of the unique aspects of GRL0167 is that it does not interact with the catalytic core, but instead binds to a distal portion of the active site
 Other research groups have determined complex structures of PLpro with GRL0617 with its catalytic cysteine, Cys 111, mutated to a serine, presumably to increase its propensity to crystallize (PDB IDs: 7JIR (
1 ) and 7CJM (
2 ))
24,25 When the three structures are compared, the GRL0167 adopts a nearly identical pose
 Minor differences in the side chain conformations of Glu167 and Gln269 are observed
 However, there is a significant difference in the pose of Leu162 between the WT and the C111S mutants (Fig
 D)
 In our WT structure, Leu162 inserts into the core of the protein, where it maintains an interatomic distance of 
4  with the catalytic cysteine
 In contrast, Leu162 of both C111S structures flip outwards, towards the solvent
 In the higher resolution structure (PDB ID 7JIR), an acetate from the crystallization condition is modelled in the active site
 When superimposed with our WT structure, this acetate clashes with Cys111 (closest distance

 Interestingly, this experiment did not use acetate in their crystallization condition
 Therefore, the density in the catalytic core of both C111S structures likely corresponds to a species of unknown identity that preferentially Given the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003 was a dire warning that was gravely overlooked in retrospect
 Looking forward, it is imperative that therapeutics are developed that are not only effective against SARS-CoV-2, but against future strains of similar coronaviruses
 PLpro is a high profile drug target, partly because it is highly conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, effective against both viruses, with a Ki of 
49 M and 
57 M, against SARS-CoV PLpro and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro
26 Likewise, all critical active site residues that interact with GRL0617 are conserved, consequently, the binding poses are nearly identical (fig
 S)
26  These similarities would indicate that PLpro inhibitors might retain their activity Previous attempts to discover SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors through HTS by others have failed to identify hits with improved enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    however, none of them showed improved enzymatic inhibition
15 Part of the reason for the difficulty in targeting SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is the lack of S1 and S2 pockets, which leaves only S3 and S4 pockets for inhibitor binding
 Among the reported SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors, GRL0617 is one of the most potent compound
 However, it had weak antiviral activity (EC50 > 20 M)
 In this study, we attempted to identify more potent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors through a HTS
 Based on two promising hits Jun-13-7 and Jun9-13-9, a library of analogs was designed and synthesized, among which several compounds had submicromolar IC50 values in the FRET-based enzymatic assay
 To alleviate the burden of relying on BSL-3 facility to test the antiviral activity of PLpro inhibitors, we developed the cell-based FlipGFP PLpro assay, which can be used to quantify the intracellular enzymatic inhibition of PLpro in a BSL-2 lab
 The FlipGFP PLpro assay is a close mimetic of the virus-infected cell in which PLpro cleaves its substrate in the native intracellular reducing environment
 The advantage of the FlipGFP PLpro assay overt the standard FRET-based enzymatic assay is that it can rule out compounds that are either cytotoxic or membrane impermeable or non-specifically modify the catalytic cysteine through oxidation or alkylation
 GRL0617 showed an EC50 of 
29 M in the FlipGFP PLpro assay, while the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor GC376 was not active (EC50 > 60 M), suggesting this assay was suitable for testing PLpro inhibitors
 Among the ten PLpro inhibitors tested in the FlipGFP PLpro assay, five compounds Jun9-53-2, Jun9-72-2, Jun9-75-4, Jun9-85-1, and Jun9-87-1 had EC50 values less than 10 M

 ;    GRL0617 and the EC50 values were consistent between the FlipGFP PLWe also solved the X-ray crystal structure of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in complex with GRL
 Binding of GRL0617 to SARS-CoV-2 induced a conformational change in the BL2 loop to the more closed conformation
 In contrast, a larger inhibitor VIR251 stabilizes the BL2 loop in the open conformation
5 The intrinsic flexibility of the BL2 loop implies that structurally diverse inhibitors might be able to fit in the S3-S4 In conclusion, the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors developed in this study represent promising hits for further development as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, and the FlipGFP PLpro assay is a suitable surrogate for testing the cellular activity of PLpro inhibitors in the BSL-Cell lines and viruses
