Topical cream with live lactobacilli modulates the skin microbiome and reduce acne symptomsTopical cream with live lactobacilli modulates the skin microbiome and reduce acne symptoms 1 University of Antwerp, Department of Bioscience Engineering, Groenenborgerlaan 171, B-2020 7 University of Antwerp, Department of Pharmaceutical, Biomedical and Veterinary Sciences, 9 Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmacy, Universiteitsplein 1, B-2610 Wilrijk, 10  University Hospital Antwerp/University of Antwerp Department of Dermatology and Venereology, 12 Correspondence: Sarah Lebeer, University of Antwerp, Department of Bioscience Engineering, 14 The skin is home to an important part of our commensal microbiota, despite it being a cool, acidic 19 and desiccated environment
 Tailored microbiome modulation approaches with, for example 20 probiotics, are highly challenging for this body site

 Facial application by 24 patients with mild-to-moderate acne symptoms was able to reduce inflammatory lesions and 25 comedone formation
 This was associated with a temporary modulation of the skin microbiome, 26 including a reduction in relative abundance of staphylococci and an increase in lactobacilli
 Skin 27 microbiome modulation by addition of carefully formulated lactobacilli seems to be new therapeutic  28 option to reduce antibiotic use for common acne symptoms
  29 Being the most extensive interface of the human body with the environment, the skin acts as a home 32 to an important part of our commensal microbiota
 Similar to the gut, the skin microbiota have 33 essential roles in the education of our immune system and the protection against invading pathogens 34 and other foreign substances
 With recent advances in DNA sequencing approaches, our knowledge 35 has been improved on the biogeography of the skin microbiota at different body sitestransitioning from these descriptive, observational studies towards a better understanding of the 37 functional roles of the commensal microbiota, allowing the design of tailored modulation 38 approaches
 However, compared with the richer environment of our intestines, the skin lacks many 39 nutrients beyond basic proteins and lipids, with sweat, sebum and the stratum corneum being main 40 
 In addition, the skin is a cool, acidic and desiccated environment and skin cells are 41 frequently renewed and shed, so that strategies targeting the skin microbiome are highly 42 challenging

 In addition, specific strains of 49 involved in the inflammation of the skin, especially by secreting lipase enzymes that are able to 51 metabolize sebum into free fatty acids which may lead to skin irritationalmost all adults are colonized with C
 acnes but only a minority have acne, highlights that other 53 bacteria such as Staphylococcus species can be linked to acne pathogenesis as pathobionts or disease 54 
 Therefore, both oral and topical antibiotics such as doxycycline, minocycline and 55 Here we explored the potential of topically applied, live probiotic lactobacilli to beneficially modulate 58 cutaneous microbial interactions and host inflammatory responses in subjects with mild-to-moderate 59 acne symptoms
 Lactobacilli were selected based on their long history of safe use in fermented 60 lactobacilli could also thrive and have health-promoting activities on the skin
  62 Prevalence of Lactobacillus on the skin
 Because lactobacilli are not considered to be commensals of 64 the skin, we first monitored the prevalence of lactobacilli on the skin of healthy volunteers
 Their 65 relative abundance was explored through 16S amplicon sequencing via Illumina MiSeq (separate runs 66 for V1V2 and V4 variable regions) of facial skin samples (cheek) of 30 volunteers (15 male and 15 67 female), who did not display acne-related symptoms
 In the samples of all female volunteers and 12 68 male volunteers Lactobacillus sequences were found (Figure a)
 Lactobacillus species generally did 69 not occur in the top five of most abundant taxa present on the skin
 However, some volunteers 70 showed a relative high abundance of Lactobacillus taxa (amplicon sequence variants or ASVs), up to 71 
4% (based on V1V2 16S sequencing) or 
3% (by V4 16S sequencing) (Figure 1b, Extended data 72 Figure a-b)
 The relative abundance of Lactobacillus taxa based on both runs (V1V2 and V4) was 73 not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    also 10-fold higher in women compared to men, with an average relative abundance of 
8% (
4% in 74 women and 
2% in men, Kruskal-Wallis p= 
 )
 (Extended Data Figure b)
 Lactobacillus taxa 75 can thus be considered as endogenous members of the skin microbiota, although their relative 76 abundance is lower than Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Cutibacterium (often still classified as 77 Propionibacterium), and Streptococcus, which were the most the dominant taxa in our dataset for 78 To confirm our in-house generated data and investigate whether our results are facial site-specific, 80 the presence of lactobacilli was also substantiated in publicly available skin metagenome shotgun 81 datasets by using the curatedMetagenomicData R-package recently described by Pasolli et al (177/466) showed the presence of at least one Lactobacillus species (Figure 1a), but only 29 samples 84 showed a relative abundance higher than %
 Yet, high relative abundances up to 52% on the skin 85 were also observed (average relative abundance based on curated metagenomics was 
79%) (Figure 86 b)
 We also included 16S amplicon data from the Human Microbiome Project (VV)relative abundance was 
9% on average due to some outliers having up to 90% relative abundance 88 (Figure b)
 The relative abundance of Lactobacillus sequences in the skin samples was also 89 compared to the publicly available data of other human body sites (both 16S and curated 90 metagenome) (Figure b)
 As expected, the vagina showed the highest relative abundance of 91 Lactobacillus taxa, but the skin turned out to be the second most important niche for these taxa
 92 Moreover, to have a better idea of the phylogenetic diversity of all Lactobacillus taxa present, we 93 also plotted all data on a phylogenetic tree of the Lactobacillus genus complexdata indicate that taxa typically associated with the human vagina, Lactobacillus crispatus, L
 iners, L
 95 gasseri and L
 jensenii were also found as the most prevalent lactobacilli on the skin (Figure 1d and 96 pentosus group and L

 The data presented here (Figure 1 a-e) indicate that these Lactobacillus taxa 101 are still present in adults, but do not stay dominant in the different human body skin sites studied
 102 Yet, despite their low relative abundance, they could still play a role as keystone microbes, recently 103 redefined as taxa exerting a considerable influence on microbiome structure and functioning 104 Rationale in vitro strain selection
 Lactobacillus strains were selected from our in-house available 108 laboratory collection (Extended Data Table 1) for tailored application in patients with mild-to 109 moderate acne symptoms
 A thorough screening approach was applied based on the rationalization 110 that the strains had to be safe, applicable (being robust and showing niche-flexibility as described for 111 ) and have the capacity to exert the desired beneficial functions on the 112 human skin including microbiome modulation, immune modulation and epithelial barrier 113 enhancement (Figure a)
 Key properties were substantiated with laboratory tests, genome 114 screening and information available in the literature
 Three Lactobacillus strains were selected i
 e
 115 Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 and L
 pentosus KCA
 The rationale for 116 GG was also selected because of previous reports on its capacity to inhibit the toxic effects of S
 120 and to augment tight-junction barrier function in human primary epidermal keratinocytesas model pathobiont associated with the inflammatory character of acne vulgaris
 S
 aureus was also 124 targeted as an important pathogen causing skin inflammation

 ;    supernatant of our collection of Lactobacillus strains was screened for antimicrobial effects on the 126 growth of C
 acnes in suspension, all Lactobacillus strains tested inhibited the growth of C
 acnes 127 ATCC6919 and S
 aureus ATCC29213, but L
 pentosus KCA1 (vaginal origin) and L
 plantarum WCFS1 128 (saliva origin) were among the bacteria tested able to exert the highest inhibition (Figure 2b and 129 Extended Data Figure b)
 Other related strains tested, including Staphylococcus epidermidis 12228, 130 did not inhibit C
 acnes growth (Extended data Figure )
 In addition, these strains were able to 131 significantly reduce the lipase activity of C
 acnes (Figure c)
 These lipase enzymes are involved in 132 inflammation of the skin induced by C
 acnes, because they metabolize sebum into free fatty acids 133 , as well as a documented dose-dependent capacity to ameliorate the appearance of 135 , we also substantiated lactic acid production by the selected 136 lactobacilli (Figure d)
 Furthermore, we validated that the three selected lactobacilli did not exhibit 137 toxic or overt inflammatory responses on primary skin cells (Figure 2e), in agreement with genome 138  and laboratory validation of antibiotic resistance profiles according to the guidelines 139 Viable Lactobacillus formulation in O/W cream
 We then aimed to design a topical formulation 142 suitable for the application of live bacteria in a sufficient dose on the skin
 The selected bacteria were 143 (Figure a)
 Various processing conditions were optimized as described in the Methods section and 145 schematized in Figure 3a, resulting in capsules of 1500 - 2000 m diameter with a core of suspended 146 freeze-dried bacteria that can be released upon applying mechanical pressure, such as rubbing on 147 the skin (Figure b)
 Ingredients were selected so that they did not significantly impact on the growth 148 capacity of the skin commensals and pathobionts (tested for S
 epidermis, S
 aureus, and L
 crispatus) 149 (Extended Data Figure 2 c-d)

 No erythema, dryness or edema was observed in any of the 155 volunteers studied (skin irritation index: 
00) (Extended Data Table )
 For comparison, adapalene 156 products, which are naphthoic acid derivatives with retinoid activity and documented efficacy in the 157 treatment of mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris, have a mean cumulative irritation index between 
25-158 
 Also the widely used combined clindamycinbenzoylperoxide treatment for moderate acne has 159 been reported to frequently induce dry skin, flaky/peeling skin, irritated skin, itchy skin and redness 160 Lactobacillus skin microbiome modulation
 Subsequently, we applied the topical cream twice daily 163 in an open-label proof-of-concept trial to ten volunteers for eight weeks twice daily at application ( 1 gram/application) (Figure a)
 Patients with mild-to-moderate acne symptoms that 165 were not using antibiotics or another acne treatment were included by the responsible dermatologist  166 (Extended Data Table )
 The impact of the Lactobacillus cream on their facial skin microbiome was 167 monitored by 16S amplicon sequencing at four different time points, over a period of 10 weeks 168 (Figure a)
 In this way, the skin baseline microbiome before, during and after the treatment was 169 compared
 The skin acne microbiome of these patients at the time of inclusion was especially 170 characterized by an increased relative abundance of Staphylococcus taxa (p= 
0058, Wilcoxon rank 171 sum test) when compared to the healthy controls (Figure 4b) (Extended Data Figure 4 for 3 specific 172 Staphylococcus ASVs)
 No significant difference in relative abundance of Lactobacillus taxa was 173 observed between our patients and the reference samples at time of inclusion (Extended Data 174 Figure a-b)
 However, we did observe a significantly reduced relative abundance of Streptococcus 175 not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 After application of the cream with the lactic-acid producing 177 lactobacilli, the facial skin samples of our acne patients at visit 2 and visit 3 clearly clustered 178 separately on a PCoA plot (Figure c)
 Interestingly, in 7 of 10 patients at visit 2 (4 weeks) and 8/10 179 patients at visit 3 (8 weeks), Lactobacillus ASVs were found in relative high abundances (between 180 
9% and 
8%), while in three patients at visit 2 and two patients at visit 3, their relative 181 abundance was below 5% (between 
015 and 
1 %) (Figure 4d and Extended Data Figure )
 ASV 182 confirmed that the detected ASVs matched the applied lactobacilli
 Interestingly, the three probiotic 184 strains appeared to persist on the skin in similar numbers (Figure d)
 To substantiate that the 185 lactobacilli detected on the skin were still viable, samples were also plated on Lactobacillus-selective 186 MRS agar
 Most samples at visit 2 (7/9) and visit 3 (6/7) were culture-positive, indicating that  at 187 least some of- the lactobacilli applied were metabolically active on the skin (Figure d)
 At visit 4 (two 188 weeks after the stop of the treatment), most Lactobacillus ASVs had disappeared and also growth in 189 MRS medium was markedly reduced, further substantiating that the lactobacilli detected originated 190 from the applied topical cream
 We then explored whether the presence of lactobacilli during 191 treatment had impacted on the pathobionts of acne (C
 acnes and Staphylococcus taxa)
 The relative 192 abundance of both pathobiont taxa dropped indeed at visit 2 and 3 and increased again at visit 4 (p< 193 
05 for visit 3 versus visit 1  Wilcoxon test for Staphylococcus) (Figure b)
  194 Lactobacillus improvement of acne symptoms
 Subsequently, the acne symptoms were clinically 195 scored as the presence of inflammatory lesions and comedones
 This analysis showed an overall 196 improvement of the acne symptoms in all patients treated with the Lactobacillus cream, as reflected 197 by a significant reduction in inflammatory lesions at visit 2 and 3 compared to visit 1, and a significant 198 reduction in comedone counts at visit 2 (Figure a)
 A significant association between comedonal 199 counts and both Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium/Cutibacterium was also found (Figure 5b), 200 but not for the inflammatory lesions (Extended Data Figure )

 ;    stopped, the acne scores increased again, indicating that the applied lactobacilli and associated 202 microbiome - staphylococcal modulation  did not persist, in agreement with the fact that the 203 exogenously applied lactobacilli could not permanently colonize (Figure 4 d)
 On the other hand, this 204 increase in acne scores when the Lactobacillus application stopped, further suggests a possible causal 205 association between the applied lactobacilli and the acne symptom reduction
 206 Acne vulgaris is a common reason for long-term antibiotic use, with dermatologists prescribing 209 multidisciplinary approach to substantiate that Lactobacillus strains have potential as skin probiotics 211 to target acne
 First, we provided detailed information that lactobacilli (and other lactic acid 212 producing taxa) are unneglectable endogenous members of the human skin microbiota, with relative 213 placement of the Lactobacillus sequences detected in our data (amplicon sequence variants) and the 215 Lactobacillus taxa (L
 crispatus, L
 iners, L
 gasseri, L
 jensenii) of the vaginal community are also 217 among the most prevalent Lactobacillus taxa for the skin
 Previous studies have briefly acknowledged 218 Lactobacillus taxa in the skin niche had not yet been performed
 Yet, we also showed that to apply 220 selected lactic acid bacteria on the skin, other properties such as robustness to (processing) stress 221 conditions and growth capacity are required, in addition to safety and lack of (transferable) antibiotic 222 resistance properties (as rationalized in Figure a)
 Following this rationalized scheme, we did 223 manage to translate our results directly from in vitro lab tests with skin cells and pathogens to human 224 volunteers, without the need for animal testing

 ;    aureus in vitro, could survive the formulation in capsules in an O/W cream and were found in similar 227 amounts after 1/1/1 application on the facial skin of patients with mild-to-moderate acne symptoms
 228 Twice daily topical application of this cream with the live lactobacilli was able to reduce inflammatory 229 acne lesions and comedone formation in the ten patients included in the open-label pilot study, and 230 was associated with a reduction in Staphylococcus relative abundance (as summarized in Figure )
 231 Our 16S rRNA ASV-based comparison of the acne facial microbiome of 30 healthy volunteers and 27 232 patients with acne symptoms suggests indeed that Staphylococcus taxa are increased in acne 233 patients and that Staphylococcus could thus form an interesting acne target to further investigate
 234 ASV level analysis of the sequenced V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene did not allow identification of the 235 Staphylococcus taxa up to species/strain level, so that no distinction between S
 epidermidis and S
 236 aureus and specific more virulent strains could yet be made
 On the other hand, microbiome 237 comparison of the skin of subjects with a healthy skin and patients with mild-to-moderate acne 238 vulgaris also pointed to other lactic acid producing bacteria such as Streptococcus salivarius as being 239 Our findings are consistent with the growing body of evidence that lactic acid bacteria such as 241 lactobacilli can be applied at multiple human body sites to target the microbiome, epithelial barrier 242 
 In this study, we now add support for the skin 243 as topical therapeutic area
 Evidently, compliance of this probiotic therapy by the patients will be a 244 key aspect to monitor  and possibly improve- in the future
 The promising results from our proof-of- 245 concept study with live lactic acid-producing microbes should now also be confirmed in larger-scale 246 and longitudinal studies, in addition to more molecular studies towards underlying antimicrobial and 247 anti-inflammatory mechanisms and probiotic effector molecules (Figure )

 A species annotation was added to each ASV by listing the species of all 369 16S sequences in the database that showed an exact match to the ASV sequence
 Contaminants 370 between relative abundances and total sample read counts were considered contamination
 For each 372 ASV, this correlation was calculated and tested for significance
 ASVs with a p-value less than 
0001 373 were removed
 Samples were filtered by removing those with less than 1000 reads left after all read 374 Biostatistical and bioinformatics analysis
 Processing of the ASV table, ASV annotations (e
 g
 376 classification) and sample annotations (metadata) were performed using the in-house R package 377 tidyamplicons, publicly available at github
 com/SWittouck/tidyamplicons
 For the analyses at the 378 genus level, ASV read counts were aggregated at the genus level or, if unavailable, at the most 379 Analysis of public datasets
 Processed OTU-table and sample metadata from the Human Microbiome 381  and the shotgun metagenomic datasets were retrieved using the MicrobeDS R 382 visualized in the R-environment using Phyloseq

 ;    qPCR for estimation of absolute bacterial concentrations
 qPCR was performed in duplicate on a 20-386 fold dilution (to avoid interference of PCR inhibitors) of total DNA isolated from the samples, using 387 the StepOnePlus real time qPCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA), SYBR 388 Green chemistry (PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, 389 USA) and primers as indicated in Extended Data Table 
 Standard curves were used to estimate 390 bacterial concentrations in the samples and derived from serially diluted DNA from an overnight 391 culture of Lactobacillus crispatus LMG12005 isolated similarly as the samples
 Bacterial concentration 392 Formulation of lactobacilli in microcapsules and O/W cream
 A single colony of the three selected 394 probiotic strains was grown until stationary phase and lyophilized
 The lyophilized bacterial powder 395 was grinded and milled (Frewitt, Switzerland) to obtain a fine powder ( subsequently encapsulated via a core-shell encapsulation approach
 Briefly, the strains were mixed in 397 equal amounts and homogeneously suspended to obtain a stable oil-based feed core suspension
 398 The shell feed solution contained a hydrocolloid alginate polymer as gelling agent
 Both liquid feeds 399 were pumped to a concentric nozzle, to obtain a concentric fluid flow
 The laminar liquid flow was 400 broken up by a vibrational unit to obtain spherical -droplets that were solidified upon falling in a 401 CFU/gram) were washed and suspended in an oil-in-water cream containing the following 403 ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Polyglyceryl-3 Rice Branate, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Nylon 404 Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Allantoin, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, 406 Cyclohexasiloxane, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Algin, p-Anisic Acid, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Disodium 407 EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Hydrochloric Acid
 The ingredients of this cream, mainly the emulsifiers 408 and preservatives, were selected to be compatible with the micro-capsules and bacteria, both during 409 storage and upon release of the probiotics

 Mechanical force (rubbing on the skin) was confirmed to break 413 the capsules, releasing the inner core material containing the suspended probiotics
 Skin irritation 414 tests with the O/W cream containing the freeze dried lactobacilli were performed as described 415 Proof-of-concept human in patients with acne vulgaris
 A proof-of-concept clinical trial was 417 performed on patients with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris included after careful assessment of the 418 responsible dermatologist by counting of comedones and inflammatory lesions (Extended Data 419 Table )
 Patients were men between 12-25 years
 Exclusion criteria were use of oral antibiotics 420 within 4 weeks prior to start of the study and use of systemic retinoids within 6 months prior to start 421 of study
 Subjects provided written informed consent before the study began
 Patients were asked to 422 g of the topical cream)
 Patients were asked to apply the cream twice daily for 56 days (8 weeks)
 The 424 patients were seen by a dermatologist at start (before the therapy) (visit 1), week 4 (visit 2), week 8 425 (visit 3) and week 10 (visit )
 A skin swab was taken at each visit, total DNA was extracted and 426 amplified for 16S amplicon sequencing as described above
 Moreover, a clinical scoring was 427 Clinical trial registration
 The protocol of this study was in accordance with the Declaration of 430 Helsinki, and was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Antwerp (Belgium) 431 before initiation of the study
