 ;    While the pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) is inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system, progressive neurodegeneration plays an important role in MS pathobiology and occurs early on in the disease process (Reich et al )
 So-called disease modifying therapies can control the inflammation to a variable extent and are thus able to decrease the frequency of relapses (Wingerchuk & Weinshenker )
 However, there is only modest evidence that the long-term disease progression is altered
 Neurodegeneration is thought to be a major driver of MS-related impairments in higher order brain functions such as cognition,  highlighting the importance of developing treatment options in this area (Amato et Exercise training has received increasing attention as a putative strategy to target the degenerative component of multiple sclerosis (Motl et al )
 Some (Kim & Sung 2017), albeit not all (Klaren et al 2016) studies conducted in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (the animal model of MS) have indicated a neuroregenerative effect of exercise
 For example, Kim et al showed that exercise can improve memory function and Moreover, there are clinical data that support the neuroprotective potential of exercise
 In healthy elderly humans, aerobic exercise training selectively increased the size of the anterior hippocampus and change in hippocampal volume was significantly related to improved memory in the exercise group (Erickson et al )
 Epidemiological studies have reported an association of physical fitness with lower risk of dementia disorders (Winblad et al )
 In addition, lifestyle interventions including exercise and nutrition counselling can reduce the risk of cognitive deterioration in people with minimal cognitive deficits (Ngandu et al)

 To our knowledge no study yet has addressed In the current study, we aimed to determine the effects of individually tailored aerobic exercise on verbal learning and memory as the primary endpoint in patients with relapsing-remitting Our trial was a single-blind, 1:1 randomized, controlled phase IIa study with an active intervention (IG) and a waitlist control group (CG)
 Patients in the IG underwent bicycle ergometry training with 2-3 sessions per week for 12 weeks and a subsequent extension phase of another 12 weeks
 During the extension phase, patients originally randomized to the waitlist group had the opportunity to train as well and intervention group patients were invited to The primary endpoint of our study was the Verbal Learning and Memory Test (VLMT) (Lux et al )

 ;    From the Verbal Learning and Memory Test (VLMT) (Lux et al 1999) we used the learning curve (words memorized in trials 1-5) and the delayed recall as a measure of memory
 This choice was based on several considerations: 
 While processing speed is often considered the most sensitive screening test for cognitive impairment in MS (Costa et al 2016), impairments in learning and memory are also highly common in this population (Chiaravalloti & DeLuca 2008); 
 Basic science and clinical trials in healthy aging have indicated that CNS networks involved in learning and memory are particularly affected by exercise (Loprinzi et al 2017) and 
 Results from our previous trial in progressive MS suggested that verbal learning and Other neuropsychological functions were tested as secondary endpoints
 We chose the Symbol-Digit-Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) to assess information processing (Fischer et al 1999) (Lpez-Gngora et al )
 Visuospatial learning and memory was assessed using the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test  Revised (BVMT-R) (Tam & Schmitter-Edgecombe )
 In addition, we applied the Corsi Block-Tapping Task (Berch et al 1998) to assess short term and working memory
 Three subtests of the Test Battery for Attention (TAP) were used to assess attention  alertness, covert shift of attention (CSA) and incompatibility (Zimmermann & Fimm )

 The Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) assessed motor function of the upper body (Feys et al )
 We included the 16-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS16SR) (Fischer et al 2015), the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Function (FSMC) (Penner et al 2009), the Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire for Multiple Sclerosis (HAQUAMS) (Gold et al 2001) and the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12) (Hobart et al )
 Bicycle spiroergometry using a Metalyser 3b (CORTEX Biophysik GmbH, Leipzig, Germany) was performed at baseline, after the intervention (week 12), and at the end of the extension phase (week )
 Peak oxygen intake (VO2peak), oxygen intake per kilogram of body weight (VO2peak/kg) and maximal power (Pmax) as well as Borg scaling and lactate levels were obtained every two minutes
 The test started with 10 watts after a two-minute resting and a two-minute warm-up phase at 10 watts
 Performance was continuously increased by 1 watt every 6 seconds which resulted in a ramp of 20 watts/2 min
 We obtained continuous recordings of stress ECG to monitor cardiovascular function
 Patients were instructed to exercise until perceived exhaustion (Borg -)

 ;    Significant treatment effects favoring the intervention group were observed for Pmax in the ITT analysis (see Table )
 This was confirmed in the PP analysis
  However, VO2 Peak and VO2/kg Reflecting on baseline fitness indices with 140-160 watts at Pmax and 25 -27 ml (O2/min)/kg at Finally, there were no significant treatment effects in any of the patient-reported outcome measures including quality of life, fatigue, mood or self-reported walking ability (see table )
 Overall, our trial of standardized exercise over 12 weeks in RRMS patients compared to a waitlist control group failed to meet its clinical endpoints
 Specifically, the study did not show effects on any cognitive measure and failed to produce significant changes in any of the obtained patient related or objective outcome measures for functioning in MS
 These results thus cast doubt on the generalizability of recent trials that suggested the potential of exercise to improve cognitive function in progressive (Briken et al 2014) or relapsing-remitting MS Compared to our previous study in progressive MS patients (Briken et al 2014), RRMS patients in the current trial were substantially less disabled physically and cognitively, thereby potentially limiting room for improvements (ceiling effect)
 Mean EDSS values were below 
0 which were the lowest among 26 recently reviewed exercise interventions in MS assessing cognition as an outcome (Sandroff et al )

 ;    show cognitive deficits in at least 40% (Chiaravalloti & DeLuca )
 Interestingly from the 26 studies referred to above, only two case report studies selected patients based on cognitive deficits
 Our study underlines that further studies on the cognitive effects of exercise treatments need to address patients presenting with relevant cognitive deficit
 Another aspect to consider is the choice of verbal learning and memory as our primary endpoint
 As described in the Methods section above, this choice was based on several considerations
 However, it could be argued that  given its high sensitivity for detecting cognitive impairment in MS  a test of processing speed (e
 g
 the SDMT or the PASAT) might have been a more suitable choice
 However, given our null effects across all cognitive domains tested as primary or secondary endpoints (including the SDMT and PASAT), this would not have changed our results
 One strength of our study is that cognition was predefined as the primary outcome
 Moreover, based on our previous work we chose verbal learning and memory as key domain
 But is verbal learning and memory the neurocognitive domain most sensitive to exercise interventions? Consistent with our earlier study in progressive MS, a recent trial on high intensity training could show effects on different cognitive dimensions with strongest effects in the verbal memory dimension of the BICAMS (Zimmer et al )
 However, in the few other MS exercise studies most effects were reported in information processing speed and executive functioning (Sandroff et al )
 From studies on healthy aging it appeared that depending on age and intervention different cognitive domains might be influenced (Htting & Rder )
 For example, Htting et al have shown an improvement of episodic memory in middle-aged adults after cardiovascular training but enhanced attention scores after a combined stretching/coordination training (Htting et al )
 Thus, further work is needed to address which domains might be most sensitive for which intervention at which intensity and at which not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Training intensity  albeit carefully tailored to the individual patients level of fitness at baseline - was only moderate
 While available meta-analyses indicate a consistent benefit of exercise training in MS on fitness (Latimer-Cheung et al 2013), this effect can be subtle or not detectable in individual trials
 In our previous trial in progressive MS (Briken et al 2014) with a similar number of training sessions over 10 weeks, VO2 peak increases in the IG were small and between group comparisons reached significance mainly due to worsening of the control group
 An earlier study in a mixed sample of relapsing and progressive patients of 8 weeks duration failed to detect significant increases in VO2peak (Schulz et al )
 Therefore, a more challenging training plan might be considered in future trials, especially in patients with Having said that, effects of exercise training on cognitive functioning in other populations seem not to directly depend on fitness parameters
 Resistance training or coordinative training regimen have been shown to improve different cognitive measures (Htting & Rder )
 Therefore, cardiovascular fitness indicators can only be regarded as surrogate markers and not In a related matter, training duration might have been too short
 MS exercise studies to date typically employ training programs of approximately 12 week duration (Latimer-Cheung et al 2013) with the longest studies up to 26 weeks
 Studies in ageing healthy adults performed training in up to 52 weeks and meta-analytic data indicate a relevant effect of intervention length (Northey et al )
 Intriguingly, the recent study by Zimmer indicated that high intensity training over just 3 weeks can have beneficial effects on cognition as well other functional domains (Zimmer et al )
 Therefore, an optimal balance of intensity and duration needs to be achieved and weighted against other factors such as treatment adherence and attrition
 In this context, acceptance of a control condition needs to be discussed

 ;    Finally, on a more optimistic note, it is conceivable that central nervous system (CNS) effects of exercise occur on a subclinical level, i
 e
 without detectable effects on formal cognitive testing
 For example, we recently showed that resistance training can alter structural MRI markers in MS (Kjlhede et al )
 Thus, MRI might be a more suitable tool to detect early alterations of functional and structural brain status, particularly in short trials
 In the current trial, we have obtained both measures of structural and functional connectivity, which will be In conclusion we could not demonstrate a beneficial effect of a 12 week moderate exercise training in minor disabled MS on a set of cognitive outcome measures
