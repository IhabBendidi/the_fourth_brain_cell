 ;    Objective - Drugs targeting the N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) system and the ability to learn new associations have been proposed as potential adjunct treatments to boost the success of exposure therapy for anxiety disorders
 However, the effects of the NMDA partial agonist d-cycloserine on psychological treatment have been mixed
 We investigated potential exposure, to inform the optimal combination of this and similar agents with psychological Methods - Unmedicated patients with panic disorder were randomised to single-dose d-cycloserine (250mg; N=17) or matching placebo (N=16) 2hrs before one session of exposure therapy
 Neurocognitive markers were assessed one day after treatment, including reaction-time based threat bias for fearful faces and amygdala response to threat
 Clinical symptom severity was measured using self-report and clinician-rated scales the day before and after treatment, and at 1- and 6-months follow-up
 Analysis was by intention-to-treat
  Results - One day after treatment, threat bias for fearful faces and amygdala threat response were attenuated in the drug compared to the placebo group
 Lower amygdala magnitude predicted greater clinical improvement during follow-up across groups
 D-cycloserine led to greater clinical recovery at 1-month follow-up (d-cycloserine 71% versus placebo %)
  threat response, and this effect predicts later clinical response
 These findings highlight a neurocognitive mechanism by which d-cycloserine may exert its augmentative effects on psychological treatment and bring forward a marker that may help understand and facilitate future development of adjunct treatments with CBT for anxiety disorders

 ;    There has been increasing interest in the combination of exposure-based cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders with drugs targeting synaptic plasticity, to improve has been shown to significantly facilitate clinical response to exposure under some conditions (1, 2), but the optimal methods for combination remain to be further identified and could be informed by characterisation of neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of We have recently developed a single-dose CBT testbed that allows the assessment of early effects of treatment on such neurocognitive markers and their contribution to clinical improvement ()
 Administering a single session of exposure therapy for panic disorder led to no clinical changes on the day after treatment, but resulted in a substantial decrease in threat bias for fearful faces
 At 1-month follow-up and without additional interim treatment, clinical improvement was apparent, with 1/3 of treated patients fulfilling criteria for recovery
 Importantly, clinical improvement was driven by the magnitude of threat bias measured on the day after treatment, with lower bias predicting improved clinical outcome
 These findings suggest that a reduction of threat bias may be a key mechanism of action in exposure therapy, and they bring forward a single-dose CBT methodology that may help ascertain the Such a focus on the mechanisms underpinning recovery with pharmacological exposure therapy can inform optimal combination of different treatment components, and it can provide This study aimed to characterise the effects of d-cycloserine with single-session CBT on neurocognitive markers important in panic disorder, including threat bias for fearful faces previously shown to mediate clinical effects of single-session CBT (3) and amygdala threat response previously shown to normalise after four sessions of exposure therapy in panic certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 We hypothesised that the d-cycloserine group compared to placebo would show reduced threat bias and amygdala threat response after single-session CBT, and that the magnitude of these markers would predict clinical symptom changes during follow-up
  Thirty-three patients with a current panic disorder diagnosis and at least moderate agoraphobic avoidance were recruited from the community
 Diagnosis was assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders; avoidance was measured using the Structured Panic Assessment Interview (yes response to >2 situations listed under (2) Avoidance ) (5, )
 Exclusion criteria were insufficient English skills, current or past psychotic or bipolar disorder, substance abuse/ dependence or epilepsy, current primary depressive disorder, CNS-active medication during the last 6 weeks, current medication with cycloserine, ethionamide or isoniazid, exposure-based CBT for panic during the last 3 months, pregnancy or lactation, and severe renal insufficiency or other serious medical conditions that may put the participant at risk
 Occasional benzodiazepine or beta-blocker medication (15% of participants) was not an exclusion criterion but patients refrained from these drugs 48 hours before sessions
 Participants with MRI contraindications (e
 g
 metal implant) were included but not enrolled in MRI
 (Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1 for CONSORT diagram)
  Figure 1 gives an overview of assessments
 Participants were randomly allocated to a single oral dose of d-cycloserine (250 mg; King Pharmaceuticals) or placebo capsule (microcrystalline cellulose) (1:1 ratio), administered 2 h before single-session CBT

 Considering that we only offered one session, and based on work showing no significant differences in clinical effects of ultra-brief CBT together with d-cycloserine between 50mg All sessions took place in a university setting
 After screening, participants returned for four study visits, with baseline assessment and intervention taking place on day 1, and outcome testing taking place 1 day, 1 month, and 6 months after intervention
 During the screening, sociodemographic (age, gender, years of education, verbal intelligence) and basic clinical data (primary panic diagnosis, comorbidity, panic duration) were acquired ()
 Clinical symptoms were assessed on all four visits
 On the day after intervention, we also assessed emotional were carried out by a trained clinical psychologist researcher (AR)
 All procedures were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by a research ethics committee
 Participants gave written informed consent
 Data were collected between November 2013 and Treatment was delivered by an experienced clinical psychologist
 The intervention followed a previously published protocol and was a condensed version of routine clinical care (3, )
 It involved one session of exposure-based CBT, based on the well-established cognitive-behavioural theory of panic ()
 Session ingredients: (i) cognitive preparation: explanation of the role of safety strategies (~15min), (ii) exposure to a fear- provoking situation (e
 g
 being locked in walk-in closet) and bodily sensations while dropping all safety strategies, to test out certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 Placebo was encapsulated in lactose capsules identical to d-cycloserine
 Generation of the randomisation sequence, treatment allocation and drug dispensing were executed by an external pharmacy not in direct contact with study participants, and the allocation list remained in pharmacy until all steps of data blind-analysis had been completed
 The and was based on blocked randomization (blocks of four) while stratifying for gender and Primary Outcomes
 Primary outcome measure was a faces dot probe task (FDOT)
 Stimuli were coloured photographs of 20 individual faces with a neutral, fearful and happy facial expression each ()
 In each of 192 trials, a neutral-neutral, neutral-happy, or neutral-fearful face pair was presented, with one stimulus appearing above and one below a central fixation position
 Eight blocks of unmasked versus masked trials each were presented alternatingly
 Faces pairs were presented for 100ms in the unmasked and 16ms (plus scrambled face pair for 84ms) in the masked condition, followed by a dot probe that participants categorised as horizontal or vertical using two buttons
 Position of an emotional face, probe position and type were fully counterbalanced
 This task design involved congruent trials (dot at the position of an emotional face) and incongruent trials (dot replaces neutral face while certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 An implicit association task (13), a second primary outcome, lead to no significant group effects and is therefore not described here
 Secondary Outcomes
 i) MRI
 Patients performed an emotion regulation task on the day after treatment during 3T MRI ()
 IAPS images showing negatively valenced panic-related scenes (e
 g
 funeral) were presented in 8 blocks of 5 images (5s each), alternating with grey fixation baseline blocks (30s) ()
 For half of the blocks, participants were instructed to naturally experience the emotional state evoked by the images, without attempting to regulate it (Maintain blocks)
 For Reappraisal blocks, they were instructed to down-regulate the provoked negative affect by using previously demonstrated strategies of cognitive reappraisal (e
 g
 reframing, rationalising)
 Individual contrast images were calculated for Maintain blocks, Reappraisal blocks, Maintain versus Reappraisal and Reappraisal versus Maintain
 Based on our previous work which identified the amygdala as hyperactive in Maintain but not Reappraisal blocks in patients with panic disorder, we ran region of interest analyses (ROI), including 10mm radius spherical masks around the peak voxel of a left amygdala region (-14/-6/-8) and its right-hemisphere counterpart, with Maintain BOLD % signal as the main outcome measure
 We further explored group effects running a mixed-effects whole-brain ii) Clinical Symptom Measures
 Before treatment, on the day after, and at 1-month and -month follow-up, anxiety and depression symptoms were monitored using established self-Inventory (BDI), iii) Body Sensations Questionnaire assessing fear of physical sensations assessing agoraphobic avoidance, and vi) Panic Attack Scale (PAS) assessing panic frequency (-)
 The clinician-administered Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) was used at baseline and follow-up appointments ()
 To establish in-vivo stress reactivity, anxiety was also measured during 5min exposure to an individually relevant agoraphobic situation, before certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    and after the day of treatment and at follow-ups (3, )
 This involved being locked in an enclosed walk-in closet (17 CYC/14 PLAC), or a bus or car drive (0 CYC/2 PLAC)
 Immediately after the test, participants rated their level of anxiety experienced during the test (before, after 1min, after 3min, end of test), using 0-100 visual analogue scales
 Baseline To capture any acute changes, blood pressure and heart rate were measured before and 2hrs after drug administration (expected peak level), and participants completed visual analogue scales rating their mood and physiological symptoms
 At the end of the intervention day, participants and experimenter also guessed whether the active capsule had been administered
  Sample Size
 We predicted that the placebo group would show next-day fear bias similar to that seen after single-session CBT (M=5, SD=25), and that the d-cycloserine group would show next-day fear bias similar to that seen in healthy volunteers (M=-15, SD=25) in our previous work ()
 With an effect size of d=
8 and an -level of 
05, 16 participants per group would be needed to achieve 70% power
 We originally aimed to recruit 50 patients for this study but this was adjusted to 32 based on the above
 Overall Statistical Approach
 Data analyses included all randomised subjects and were performed on the intention-to-treat basis (16 PLAC, 17 CYC), except for MRI measures which were analysed per protocol (14 PLAC, 13 CYC)
 No data was excluded from analysis
 To account for participants lost to follow-up (Supplementary Figure 1), missing data were imputed, assuming data missing at random, by means of multiple imputation by chained equations (incomplete cases: 1-month follow-up 6% PLAC/ 6% CYC, 6-months follow-up: 19% PLAC/ 18% CYC)

 In the FDOT, reaction times (RT) below 200 ms and above 2000 ms, or above 2 SDs above the mean, were excluded (3, )
 Bias scores were calculated by subtracting the median RT in congruent trials from the median RT in incongruent trials
 Group differences were assessed using linear mixed-effects models, including the fixed factors group and condition (happy, fear)
 MRI data were analysed using FSL FEAT 
0 BOLD % signal changes were entered into linear mixed-effects models with the factors group Clinical Symptom Measures
 Group differences on the validated clinical outcome measures and stress test ratings were assessed using linear mixed-effects models, including the factors group and time (next day, 1-month, 6-months) and their interaction, and controlling for pre-treatment scores
 In line with recent work, recovery was defined as agoraphobia scores (MI) falling within the range reported for healthy subjects, as this measure most reliably reflects the impact of the disorder on daily functioning (3, )
 Following established approaches, we also ran eight separate multiple linear regression analyses to predict whether i) BOLD % amygdala signal change (Maintain block) and ii) threat bias (FDOT) on the day after treatment predicted symptom changes at 1-month follow-up on the MI, BSQ, ACQ, or PDSS certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 Next-day symptom severity (baseline for PDSS) on that measure was entered as predictor of no interest to control for its potential influence on the outcome at 1 month
 Group, bias, and the group- bias interaction term were entered as predictors of interest
  Next-day threat bias for fearful faces was significantly lower in the d-cycloserine compared to MRI

10), Threat bias for fearful faces (FDOT) and amygdala response to aversive images were significantly lower in the d-cycloserine compared to the placebo group on the day after treatment
 Greater next-day reduction in amygdala threat response was associated with greater significantly greater clinical recovery at 1-month follow-up than placebo (71% vs 25%), but recovery rates were not statistically different at 6-months follow-up (71% vs %)
 There were no group differences on clinical measures specific to panic disorder, but the drug improved response to an in-vivo stress test and outcome on more global measures of mental health, including state-trait anxiety and depression, with medium to large effects
  These findings highlight a possible neuropsychological mechanism of action of exposure-based CBT that might also be a crucial interface for d-cycloserine action
 Across participants, lower amygdala response on the day after treatment predicted lower symptom severity one month later, suggesting that this neural effect might be a key mechanism by which exposure therapy exerts its clinical effects
 The amygdala is thought to be crucial in threat processing, and increased responsivity is characteristic of anxiety disorders ()
 In contrast, a reduction in amygdala hypersensitivity is seen after exposure therapy, where threat stimuli lose their potential to automatically signal danger (25, )
 Our results suggest that this change in amygdala function occurs very rapidly during CBT, after only one session
 Over time and in interaction with everyday challenges, this reduced threat sensitivity presumably translates into more distinct symptom improvement

 ;    Even though this study identified no specific neuropsychological mechanism of d-cycloserine action, the drug significantly reduced attention bias and amygdala threat responsivity within one day of treatment
 These findings corroborate the idea that threat processing might be a landmark parameter for treatment enhancement with d-cycloserine
 The drug is thought to enhance NMDA receptor functioning and neuroplasticity in the amygdala and hippocampus, areas relevant to fear extinction and threat processing ()
 It is possible that d-cycloserine exerts its augmentative clinical effects by further amplifying changes in amygdala sensitivity taking place during exposure
 As our results show, these changes occur early during treatment, providing a rationale as to why d-cycloserine has particularly beneficial effects on clinical Although our clinical results remain to be replicated in a large-scale clinical trial, this study also replicates earlier findings showing that 25% of patients reach recovery one month after single-session CBT ()
 The present results add to this observation, indicating that these clinical effects are not only stable during a follow-up of 6 months, but that additional clinical gains may be achieved during this time-frame
 This study also provides preliminary evidence that d-cycloserine may improve clinical response to single-session CBT
 71% of participants in the d-cycloserine group fulfilled criteria for recovery at 1- and 6-month follow-up, a rate comparable to standard longer-term CBT courses ()
 These findings point to the possibility that if used in an optimal way, targeting very early therapeutic learning, d-cycloserine may While these results are promising for the development of more compact psychological-that FDOT threat bias one day after single-session CBT predicted clinical improvement, this observation was not replicated in this study
 Recent work into the psychometric properties of the dot probe task suggests weak test-retest reliability, indicating that alternative measures of threat bias might be preferable ()

 ;    amygdala threat response was more sensitive to brief treatment than the behavioural measures used, leading to large effect sizes of d>1 and predicting clinical recovery
 However, MRI and threat bias measures were only applied after but not before treatment, limiting our ability to evaluate to what degree observed between-group differences on the day after treatment relate to within-subject change
 Furthermore, this study was designed to detect neurocognitive rather than clinical effects of d-cycloserine, and even though our clinical observations indicate efficaciousness of single-session CBT with d-cycloserine, these findings need to be validated in a large-scale trial to reliably evaluate clinical efficacy of this combination intervention
 While our participants are representative of those seen in routine clinical care regarding symptom severity and sociodemographic markers, they were recruited from the community rather than being treatment-seekers, and they were unmedicated ()
 Future trials will have to investigate whether the facilitative effects of d-cycloserine on single-session CBT found here Taken together, this is the first study to identify a neurocognitive mechanism by which d-cycloserine may deploy its augmentative effects on clinical outcomes during exposure therapy for anxiety
 The drug substantially amplifies changes in amygdala threat reactivity taking place early in psychological treatment, and the magnitude of these changes predicts clinical improvement across time
