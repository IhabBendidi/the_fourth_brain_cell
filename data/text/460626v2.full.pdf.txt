 ;    Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown aetiology, causing scarring of the lung, shortness of breath, cough and reduction in lung function
 A UK study demonstrated an increase in incidence of IPF by 35% between 2000 and 2008 , with higher incidence in men and older age groups []
 Incidence and mortality continues to rise and is also increasing globally []
 IPF is fatal with no current cure, though disease-modifying treatments are being introduced
 In many cases, earlier palliative intervention could reduce the burden on the individual, as recommended in cancer care [3, 4], yet the variable natural history of IPF makes it difficult to predict care The Sheffield Profile for Assessment and Referral to Care (SPARC) is a holistic needs tool, comprising 45 items across 9 domains, that can aid health professionals in identifying needs for palliative care []
 Respondents find the questions easy to understand [6] and the tool has been adapted to international settings []
 Such systematic assessment provides a useful indication of symptom distress []
 Yet those who suffer chronic disease may not achieve the SPARC criteria for immediate clinical assessment, defined as a score of 3 in a single question, as habituation or affective comorbidity can affect symptom perception [5, 9, ]
 Regular completion of 45 items can be burdensome for those who suffer most [8], whilst self-assessment may result in Rasch-based methodology generates a scaled value for a set of responses as an interaction between question difficulty and the individuals likelihood of scoring

 ;    We aimed to determine whether the SPARC could be used with IRT methodology to generate a tool that could appropriately distinguish disease progression in a UK clinical cohort of IPF patients [19, 20], helping to predict short-term prognosis
  The Prospective Observation of Fibrosis in Lung Clinical Endpoints (PROFILE) Central England (NCT01134822) study is a longitudinal observational clinical trial that has been described previously [19, ]
 Age was grouped at 65 or under, 66-79, 80 or over; comorbidities were grouped as none, 1-2, 3 or more
 People were asked to complete the SPARC questionnaire, comprised of dichotomous items in two domains, as well as polytomous items in six domains (Supplementary Doc )
 243 people from the PROFILE Central England study completed the SPARC and were subsequently included in the All analyses were performed in Stata (SE
 )
 Lung function measures recorded at the initial SPARC assessment (30 days) were used as baseline, with an outcome of disease progression within one year of SPARC completion defined as 10% relative decline in FVC or death
 Percent predicted DLCO (%DLCO) and FVC (%FVC) was calculated using the suite of Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) tools available from the European Respiratory Society []
 Where %FVC (n=21) or %DLCO (n=75) could not be confirmed due to missing data, people were excluded from the relevant statistical A two-parameter graded response model was ultimately constructed with items showing good discrimination and model assumptions were verified [11, ]
 Parameters of discrimination and difficulty were assigned to each item (survey question) according to how well it could differentiate people across the scale of the underlying distress trait (theta), as well as the probability of a particular answer

 Tukey post-hoc analysis We calculated the area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve for the ability of the cumulative IPARC Score to predict disease progression within 12 months, as well as overall mortality compared with %FVC or %DLCO
 The sensitivity and the Kaplan-Meier curves plotted time to disease progression, or overall mortality, against days since completing the questionnaire according to categories of IPARC Score
 Cox regression estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of disease progression, as well as death in 365 days (12 months), 180 days (6 months) and 90 days (3 months) according to increment or categories of IPARC Scores; lowest scorers as reference

 To understand the influence of missing data we evaluated distress according to completion of lung function (see Supplementary Table )
 Patients with missing %FVC data were more likely to have died (

 ROC subsequently assessed the ability of the IPARC Score to predict death compared with lung function recordings in 167 people with complete data
 We identified %DLCO as having the largest AUC of

 The cumulative IPARC Score provided an AUC of

 ;    A sub-analysis was performed on a small sample who had an IPARC score before and after pirfenidone treatment to preliminarily assess therapy modification of the IPARC score (Supplementary Figure SF)
 Overall, in 12 patients with matched scores taken at a year interval, there was a non-significant trend towards increased distress following therapy with pirfenidone
 The change in level of distress with treatment was driven by the IPARC category prior to therapy; patients scoring under 9 (mild distress) demonstrated more distress following therapy (p=
0086), whilst those scoring 9 or over (high level of distress) had a more varied response including some reduction in IPARC The SPARC questionnaire is recognised within the UK National Health Service as a way to help address and improve end-of-life care management [5, 6, 9, ]

 Disease distress correlated with percent predicted lung function and could scoring highest also at greatest risk of death
 The associations of disease distress with lung function, disease progression and mortality support the IPARC Score as a valid tool Previous studies using alternate patient reported outcomes to measure quality of life in IPF have similarly noted weak to moderate correlations with lung function measures, including the MRC dyspnoea scale, ATAQ-IPF and CAT [-]

 However, the MRC dyspnoea scale is one dimensional, ATAQ-IPF remains extensive at 75 items and CAT was developed for COPD, which at 8 items is convenient but may not have the sensitivity to capture IPF traits []
 Whilst the original SPARC is a broad palliative assessment survey, answers provided by an IPF population specify appropriate items in the IPARC tool
 The unabbreviated name, IPF Prognostic Assessment and Referral to Care, reflects the purpose and cohort it was developed with, as well as the tool it originated from
 IRT is an increasingly applied methodology that lends itself to parametric tests, providing an evidence base for reusing questions that can be used to distinguish traits of interest [16, 18, ]
 This study supports the use of IRT methodology in optimising questions within healthcare surveys to predict patient outcomes
 Questions that did not distinguish levels of distress, such as those which scored low for the vast majority (e
 g
 Q33: Religious or spiritual needs not being met), or those that can show clustering of responses (e
 g
 Q30: Thoughts about ending it all; Q32: Worrying thoughts about death or dying) can be dropped in order to retain items offering the most discriminatory value
  IRT methodology can also assess the way in which an item may be answered differently according to demographic traits that are unrelated to the latent trait of distress, termed differential item functioning (DIF)[16, ]
 We identified no DIF in the final model according to gender, indicating men and women with IPF report distress similarly
 Of the 243 individuals sampled in this study two were of non-white origin, and thus we were not able to assess the influence of ethnicity on patient responses
 Further study in more prognostic value
 DIF by demographics of age category and comorbidity count was identified for item 21 (Feeling restless and agitated), however the analyses indicate an underlying relationship between these demographics and disease distress, so are not defined as DIF

 Within clinical settings, the SPARC questionnaire could be considered too sensitive, or excessive depending on health status [6, 9], whilst under-reporting of distress is an issue in progressive disease [10, ]
 Use of the cumulative score over 11 items provides greater opportunity to capture distress when under-reported, whilst shorter health questionnaires can provide similar insight to lengthier The mean distress for those with lowest %DLCO equated to a score of 
1, with a score of 9 being subsequently used as a threshold point for grouping people who may undergo disease progression within one year
 Lung function measures are a valuable tool in recordings that may not reflect the actual timing of progression
 Those who progressed had an average score of 
8, which supports an IPARC Score of 9 as a suitable benchmark, particularly as those who died had an average score of 
 
  Other self-reported surveys exist to measure health status in those with progressive lung authors of K-BILD used patient interviews to define a series of pertinent questions and Rasch analysis to refine the item list to 15 with 4 domains and a 7-point Likert scale
 We use similar methodology to refine the list of predetermined SPARC items, as answered by a sample of 243 IPF patients, to a set of 11 within a single domain and a 4-point Likert scale
 Whilst K-BILD offers an empowering way to self-monitor respiratory health, IPARC should be completed within clinical settings where rapid disease progression is a ROC analysis confirmed that %DLCO was the best measure for predicting one year mortality in this cohort []

 Lung function measurements can be challenging for patients with severe disease to provide, and this appears particularly apparent in people missing DLCO who were significantly more distressed than those without missing DLCO values
 These data illustrate the considerable survival bias associated with lung function data in studies of patients with progressive lung disease
 As a result, these analyses may Therapy modified quality of life measures can inform whether an intervention is necessary or successful []
 We undertook a preliminary analysis on a very small subset of patients, which indicated that treatment with pirfenidone in patients with mild levels of distress may be associated with increased levels of distress following anti-fibrotic therapy
 This is consistent with the known adverse effect profile of pirfenidone though we do not account for clinical presentation or disease progression on therapy
 We intervention to assess whether IPARC can be used to define individuals for whom a Survival curves indicated that whilst the majority of the cohort survived one year after completing their SPARC questionnaire, those with the highest IPARC scores had poorer life expectancy than those scoring lowest
 The positive predictive value of mortality in one year was 29% for those scoring above the threshold of 9, and increased to 43% for those scoring 19 or more
  The findings provide evidence that patient reported distress can predict early mortality with similar accuracy to predictions made with FVC lung Adjusted survival analyses further show that risk of one-year mortality increased by 10% with each incremental point, whilst risk of progression increased by %

 This relatively large sample of people with confirmed IPF supports the benefit of patient reported distress in predicting disease Given that it is challenging to perform lung function in patients with progressive disease it is important to develop clinical markers of prognosis as well as assessing health status
 The IPARC Score requires no specialist equipment or training to complete or calculate, takes consideration of the individuals concerns, can be undertaken at any time without a requirement for repeated measures, and can aid decisions to review patients earlier
 Combined with its associations with lung function and mortality, this patient-reported outcome is a potential component of composite endpoints in clinical trials, although further validation and studies on treatment sensitivity are essential []
 The predictive capacity could not exclude all false positives, yet we recognise that early integration of palliative care can improve outcomes in other progressive diseases [3, 4, ]
 Future studies may include IPARC Score as part of a composite scoring system for accurately recommend utilising it in combination with available lung function recordings when The simple practicality of the tool allows an assessment of factors impacting quality of life to identify appropriate clinical management strategies such as supplemental oxygen for those reporting high distress with shortness of breath, or domiciliary support and assistive living devices to reduce distress from losing independence
 Where best supportive care is indicated through high score and clinical presentation, the tool encourages a focus on the most distressing features for the individual []
