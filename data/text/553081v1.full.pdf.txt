8 weeks) walked in a pool 4 (depth 
3 m) for 1 h
 A few days later, they walked on a street for 1 h
 Within each 5 activity, the starting and ending levels of plasma renin activity (PRA) and serum 6 aldosterone (SA) were compared using paired t-test
 Total urine volume, creatinine 7 clearance, and change in PRA levels between each activity were compared by t-test
 8 Regression coefficients for total urine volume and creatinine clearance during pool 9 walking were estimated by linear regression and additionally controlled for the change 10 in PRA levels
 Land walking served as the reference group
 11 during pool walking: the mean starting and ending values of PRA and SA were 
8 vs
 13 
5 ng/mL/h (p=
002) and 654 vs
 473 pg/mL (p=
02), respectively
 Compared to land 14 walking, the decrease in PRA level was more evident in pool walking (-
27 vs
 
81 15 ng/mL/h, p=
004), resulting in higher total urine volume and creatinine clearance in 16 pool walking (both p<

1,2,3,4 Currently, up to 10% of pregnant women have hypertensive disorders of 6 pregnancy,5,6 and the prevalence of preeclampsia, the major contributor for maternal 7 death, has been increasing over time particularly in (but not limited to) developed 8 countries such as the USA

  2 Although the biological pathogenesis of preeclampsia is widely uncertain, it is 3 recognized not merely as a disease of high blood pressure/renal dysfunction but also as a 4 system

 The dimensions of the pool having six lanes were as follows: length 25 2 m (
3 yds), depth 
3 m (
3 ft)
 The water temperature was set at 31-32C, and the 3 ambient room temperature at -C
 A few days later (2 to 9 days), the same 4 participants walked on a street, i
 e
, a conventional prenatal activity, near the Kubota 5 Maternity Clinic for 1 hour at their own pace
 We first planned to conduct this study in the 6 typical cross-over design by randomizing half of the participants to the reverse sequence
 7 However, due to a potential risk based on our empirical experience that land walking 8 might induce labor,20 we finally decided not to choose the typical cross-over design to 9 prioritize the safety of our participants and their babies
 Therefore, every participant 10 firstly did pool walking and then land walking
 The weather conditions during land 11 walking were fine/cloudy, the temperature was ~23 to 26C, and the humidity was ~ 40 to 12 %
 During each activity, the participants were allowed to drink water freely
 Dates for 13 each activity were determined according to the schedule of the participants
 14 The eligible participants in this study were pregnant women (aged 20 to 39) with a 15 normal pregnancy (gestational age, 37 weeks and above), who had prenatal care at the 16 Kubota Maternity Clinic and had already participated in the pool walking program before 17 the study period
 Participants were ineligible if they presented cardiovascular disease, 18 amniorrhexis, or anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dl), or those considered not suitable for this 20 study by physicians
 We initially recruited 16 participants (11 participants in October 21 2012 and five participants in October )
 One participant (37 years of age, 
4 weeks 22 of gestational age, and 35 sessions of pool walking before the study) was excluded due to 23 delivery before land walking exercise; therefore, only 15 participants were included in the 24 not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Since no previous studies with the effect of pool walking in pregnant women 1 were available, sample size was calculated based on a previous study of water 2 Body weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and pulse rate were measured at the 6 start and end of each walking activity
 Blood samples were collected at the start and end 7 of each walking activity, and the starting and ending levels of plasma renin activity 8 (PRA), serum aldosterone (SA), hematocrit, and serum creatinine were measured
18,19 9 Within each walking activity, we calculated the changes in each parameter, subtracting 10 the starting levels from the ending levels
 According to previous studies, we defined the 11 change in PRA as a potential indicator for the regulation of the 12 Before each walking activity, all participants urinated
 During each walking 14 activity, all urine samples were collected, and the total amount of urine was recorded
 15 With the total urine sample at the end of each walking activity, urine creatinine was 16 measured
 All laboratory measurements were performed at the Clinical Laboratory 17 Center of Fukuoka City Medical Association, Fukuoka, Japan
 We calculated creatinine 18 clearance as follows: creatinine clearance = urine creatinine (mg/dL)  urine volume 19 (mL/min)/[(serum creatinine at the start + serum creatinine at the end)/2 (mg/dL)]
 20 Between each activity, the starting levels of clinical and renal function parameters, as well 23 as the changes in these parameters, were compared by t-test

 Within each activity, the starting and 1 ending levels of each parameter were compared by paired t-test
 The analyses for total 2 urine volume and creatinine clearance were restricted to 14 participants since it was not 3 possible to collect a sample from one participant during land walking
 4 We estimated the regression coefficient () and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5 pool walking for total urine volume and creatinine clearance, respectively
 The land 6 walking activity served as a reference
 Age, body mass index, and gestational age were 7 adjusted as confounding variables (model )
 In model 2, the decrease of PRA was 8 additionally controlled as a potential mediating variable, i

, this variable would not 9 confound the association between walking activity and the renal function but might 10 instead help to explain the observed difference between activities

17 Therefore, this prenatal activity was safe 6 (walk as normal walking on land), had advantages of hydrostatic pressure, and 7 required no special skills (swimming/breathing techniques)
 By contrast, the efficacy of 8 other types of aquatic activities without the head-out position such as swimming might be 9 inconsistent
 In a previous study, moderate to strong swimming stimulated the 10 our empirical experience, compared to swimming, pool walking tended to be more 12 comfortable for pregnant women since they preferred pool walking (the attendance rates 13 for swimming and pool walking activities were ~20% and ~80%, respectively)
20 In 14 addition, pool walking should be more "fun" compared to water immersion, in which 15 participants just stood/sat still in the water for several hours
18  16 Our study had some limitations
 First, in order to prioritize the safety of our 17 participants and their babies, we were not able to conduct our study in the typical 18 cross-over design, and every participant first walked in water and then walked on land
 19 This one-arm design might potentially carry-over the effect of pool walking to land 20 walking
 However, our participants walked on land at least two days after pool walking, 21 and we confirmed that the baseline characteristics did not differ between the two 22 activities
 In addition, previous studies stated that PRA levels recover to baseline levels 23 within a few hours after aquatic activities

 Second, in addition to our small sample size, patients with hypertensive 1 disorders in pregnancy were excluded, thereby limiting the generalizability of the results
 2 In addition, other circulatory parameters (arterial diameters and arterial blood flow)18,28 3 and hormonal pathways (atrial natriuretic peptide)24 were not available
 However, our 4 empirical experience might support improved placental perfusion by pool walking 5 (Figure )
20 Third, although our data demonstrated temporal changes in the 6 renin-angiotensin-aldosterone levels and renal function, our study did not assess the 7 long-term and dose-response effects
 Indeed, we did not observe the between-activity 8 differences in the baseline characteristics, which might suggest that only one session of 9 pool walking activity may not prevent preeclampsia risk along with other hypertensive 10 disorders of pregnancy
 Therefore, future studies are needed to clarify the long-term 11 effect of pool walking with a randomized control design and to explore the potential 12 benefits on cardiovascular health among not only pregnant women but also those with 13 In conclusion, this novel, pool walking activity may temporarily improve renal 15 Aquatic facilities are widely available at community-level (e
