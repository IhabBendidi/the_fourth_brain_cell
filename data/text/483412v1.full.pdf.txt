 ;    There is increasing recognition that obesity and type 2 diabetes are characterized by sub-clinical inflammation, which may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis []
 Since intensive glycaemic control has not been found to reduce cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes [2], reducing inflammation may be an important focus for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this group of patients
 Diabetes lifestyle intervention aims to improve glycaemic control, lipids and blood pressure levels, but appropriate dietary changes may also influence levels of inflammation
 We therefore measured a selection of inflammatory markers in the Lifestyle Over and Above Drugs in Diabetes (LOADD) study, a randomized controlled trial which investigated the effect of a six month intensive dietary intervention in 93 participants with type 2 diabetes with poor glycaemic control whose drug therapy had been optimized according to treatment guidelines The LOADD study has been described in detail elsewhere []
 The study was approved by the Lower South Regional Ethics Committee of New Zealand (LRS/05/07/026), and recommendations from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [5], or a usual care control group

 ;    Remaining cytokines were measured by Lumenix bead array multiplex system using beads and plates from Millipore (MA, USA) and a Bio-Plex suspension array instrument (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA)
 Participant samples were analysed in duplicate in RIAs and ELISAs, and using single samples in multiplex and CRP assays
 Samples from RIAs and ELISAs with coefficients of variation  20% were excluded from further analysis
 The data were analysed according to modified intention to treat
 Multiple regression was used to estimate the difference between treatments adjusting for the baseline, age and sex
 As the data were log transformed before analysis the differences are presented as the ratio (95% confidence interval) of the geometric means at six months
 Pairwise correlation coefficients to assess the relationship between changes in IL-18 and neopterin were generated using non-The effect of the LOADD study dietary intervention on levels of adipokines and inflammatory markers is shown in Table 
 The intervention group exhibited significant reductions in IL-18 and neopterin levels relative to the control group
 No significant changes were observed in other inflammatory markers and adipokines, although neopterin levels showed a decrease of borderline significance (p = 
 )
 After adjustment for baseline BMI and HbA1c, the effect size for the change in IL-18 was minimally altered, with a difference of 
90 (95% CI:

99, p=
 )
 Changes in IL-18 and neopterin were correlated, with a pairwise correlation coefficient of r = 
299 (p = 
009, n = )
 This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of an evidence-based six month dietary intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes on a range of adipokines and inflammatory markers

 ;    further adjustment for baseline BMI and HbA1c levels
 While obesity is associated with increased inflammation, these results suggest that an evidence-based dietary intervention can A reduction in neopterin levels of borderline significance was also observed
 Neopterin release from macrophages is induced by IL-18 (via induction of IFN- [8]), and increases in circulating neopterin levels have been observed in monkeys after an injection of IL-18 []
 It is likely that changes in neopterin therefore occurred downstream of the reduction in circulating IL-18 levels in our study, as changes in neopterin levels were correlated with The LOADD study dietary intervention resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of total energy (%TE) consumed as protein, a significant reduction in %TE consumed as saturated fat, and an increase in dietary fibre intake of borderline significance []
 Previous metabolic studies by Esposito et al have shown that IL-18 increases after a high fat meal and decreases after a high fibre meal []
 Changes in inflammatory markers in the LOADD study are therefore consistent with the short-term changes observed by Esposito et al []
 The mechanism underlying these changes is unclear, but there is evidence that dietary modification influences gut microbiota [11], that IL-18 is produced in the gut [12], and that different bacteria produce diverging effects on IL-18 expression in intestinal cells in vitro []
 Therefore our observations could be explained by the interaction of dietary components with gut bacteria resulting in altered levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines
 Chance may explain the significant reduction in IL-18 levels observed in our study
 However, changes in neopterin levels are induced by IL-18, and the correlated changes in neopterin and IL-18 suggest the significant reduction in IL-18 is likely to reflect a true biological effect of The relationship between an evidence-based dietary intervention and reduction in IL-18 levels, independent of adiposity and glycaemia, suggests a further mechanism by which diet not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
