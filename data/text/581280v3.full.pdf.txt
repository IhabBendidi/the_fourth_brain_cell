 ;    Background: Current treatments for depression are limited by suboptimal efficacy, delayed response, and frequent side effects
 Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) is a non-invasive Recent methodological advancements suggest iTBS could be improved through 1) treating with multiple sessions per day at optimally-spaced intervals, 2) applying a higher overall pulse-dose of stimulation and 3) precision targeting of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) to subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) circuit
 We examined the feasibility, tolerability, and Methods: Twenty-one participants with TRD received open-label SAINT
 FcMRI was used to individually target the region of L-DLPFC most anticorrelated with sgACC
 Fifty iTBS sessions (1800 pulses per session, 50-minute inter-session interval) were delivered as 10 daily sessions over 5 consecutive days at 90% resting motor threshold (adjusted for cortical depth)
 Results: Nineteen of 21 participants (
48%) met criteria for remission (10 on the Montgomery-demonstrated no negative cognitive side-effects
 There were no seizures or other severe adverse Discussion: Our accelerated, high-dose, iTBS protocol with fcMRI-guided targeting (SAINT) was well tolerated and safe
 Efficacy was strikingly high, especially for this treatment-resistant population

 ;    Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and approximately 800,000 suicides are completed each year ()
 Current FDA-approved antidepressant treatments do not achieve remission in the majority of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) (46), are limited by tolerability (7) and have extended treatment durations, which do not match the imminent risk to suicidal patients ()
 New antidepressant treatments are needed that are safe, tolerable, Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) is an FDA-approved non-invasive brain stimulation technique for TRD ()
 rTMS involves passing an electrical current through a magnetic coil placed superficial to the scalp, producing a high-intensity magnetic field that passes through the scalp, skull and meninges to excite neuronal tissue ()
 Repeated high-frequency excitation of the same brain region results in strengthening of synapses through a process known as long-term potentiation (LTP) (13, 14), causing changes in functional connectivity (13, )
 The antidepressant mechanism of rTMS is hypothesized to be mediated in part through indirect inhibitory functional connectivity from L-A more efficient form of rTMS, known as intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), has been developed, which has significantly shortened the duration of treatment sessions from 37 minutes to 3 minutes (18) and produces equivalent antidepressant responses (19, )
 FDA-approved rTMS and iTBS courses involve daily stimulation sessions (600 iTBS pulses) for 6 weeks, achieving remission in 32% of patients and response in 49% ()
 Studies suggest that the efficacy of iTBS could be improved by optimized iTBS session spacing, accelerated delivery (24), higher overall pulse-doses (10, 25, 26) and individualized targeting (15, )

 ;    We implemented all of these potential improvements on rTMS treatment of depression into an (fcMRI)-guided targeting
 This protocol includes 5 consecutive days of 10-daily iTBS sessions (1800 pulses per session) delivered to the region of the L-DLPFC that is most functionally anticorrelated with the sgACC in each individual ()
 Individualized fcMRI-guided targeting, optimized intersession interval spacing, accelerated delivery and high pulse-dose were predicted to collectively result in higher response and remission rates than current FDA-approved TMS (SAINT) to distinguish this protocol from other attempts at accelerating TMS protocols without individualized targeting, optimized intersession spacing or high pulse-dose (29, )
 Our incipient investigation of SAINT demonstrated surprisingly high efficacy in a small cohort of participants with extremely severe and treatment refractory depression ()a
 The study we describe herein builds upon our initial report by testing SAINT in a larger and more generalizable cohort of participants with TRD to examine the feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy of this approach

 ;    Participants were required to be currently experiencing a non-psychotic, non-atypical major depressive episode as part of either bipolar II disorder or major depressive disorder (MDD) as defined by DSM-5 criteria and not responded to at least 1 antidepressant medication
 At the time of screening, participants were required to have a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item (HDRS-17) score of 20 or higher, a negative urine drug screen and negative urine pregnancy test if female
 Participants were excluded if they had any contraindications to rTMS such as history of seizures, metallic implants in the head, cardiac pacemakers or a neurological disorder
 Participants were recruited through the Depression Research Clinic at Stanford University, study Twenty-three participants (aged 19-78, 13 female) were recruited for this study
 One participant was screened out post-enrollment for having a very high motor threshold (>90% machine output) and 1 participant with a history of multiple prior therapeutic intolerances (anxiety leading to early discontinuation of intravenous ketamine infusions and conventional rTMS) dropped out after the first day of stimulation due to anxiety
 This resulted in a final sample of 21 participants (aged -78, 12 female)
 Nineteen participants had a diagnosis of MDD, and 2 participants had a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder currently in a depressive episode (>1 year)

 ;    Before the stimulation course, each participant had both structural MRI and resting-state fMRI scans
 All MRI scans were acquired using a 3-tesla GE Discovery MR750 scanner with a -channel imaging coil at the Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging at Stanford, using a 3x accelerated multiband imaging sequence with a repetition time of 2 seconds
 During the -minute resting state scans, participants were instructed to let their minds wander, avoid repetitive thoughts, keep their eyes open and their attention focused on a central fixation point
 A MagVenture MagPro X100 (MagVenture A/S, Denmark) system was used to deliver sessions of iTBS; 60 cycles of 10 bursts of 3 pulses at 50Hz were delivered in 2-second trains (5Hz) with an 8-second inter-train interval Stimulation sessions were delivered hourly ()
 Ten sessions were applied per day (18,000 pulses/day) for 5 consecutive days (90,000 pulses in total)
 Stimulation was delivered at 90% resting motor threshold (rMT; )
 A depth correction was applied (34) to consistently achieve 90% rMT at the depth of the functional target
 Stimulation was never delivered above 120% rMT for safety ()
 The Localite Neuronavigation System (Localite GmbH, Sankt Augustin, Germany) was used to position the TMS coil over the individualized stimulation target

 At the end of each day of stimulation (10 sessions), depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 6-item (HDRS-)
 The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) was completed daily to assess for hypomania ()
  A neuropsychological test battery was administered before and after SAINT to capture any neurocognitive side effects
 The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test  Revised (HVLT-R) (37), the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test  Revised (BVMT-R) (38), subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (4th Ed

 See supplementary material for detailed information Personalized L-DLPFC targets were generated for each participant using the baseline resting-state scan
 All analyses were conducted in a participants own brain space
 Resting-state scans were pre-processed according to typical methods using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) scans were then co-registered with the resting-state scans
 Next, the estimation parameters to warp the T1-weighted structural image into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space were calculated using SPM segmentations based on tissue probability maps
 These normalization parameters were inverted and applied to MNI space regions of interests (ROIs) for the L-DLPFC (Brodmann area 46) and the sgACC (BA25) to map these ROIs onto the individual participants brain
 The participant-space ROIs were then resliced, smoothed, and binarized to match the The participant-space ROI for the L-DLPFC formed the search area for the optimal TMS coil placement

 Median time series were then created for each functional subunit, and the correlation coefficients were calculated between all median time series extracted from all functional subunits of the L-DLPFC and sgACC
 The second algorithm determined the optimal L-DLPFC subunit to target based on 3 factors: the net correlation/anticorrelation of the L-DLPFC subunit with sgACC subunits, the size of the subunit and the spatial concentration of the subunit
 See supplementary methods for more details on these algorithms
 Three-dimensional maps of the whole brain correlation coefficient of the selected L-DLPFC subunit were then created and used to target the coil placement using the Localite TMS Navigation software (Localite GmbH, Sankt Augustin, Germany)

 Our primary outcome measure was change in MADRS scores from baseline to immediately following SAINT, and MADRS scores were used to calculate response and remission rates
 Reductions in HDRS-17, HDRS-6 and BDI-II scores were used as secondary outcome measures of depression severity
 Response was defined as 50% reduction in these scales
 Remission was defined as MADRS score 10 (41), 7 on HDRS-17 (42), 4 on the HDRS-6 (43) and 12 on the BDI-II ()

 We tested this in part by including participants who had a history of non-response to conventional rTMS (rTMS non-responders, n=)
 When comparing the non-responder group to the rest of the participants, we found that conventional rTMS non-responders had similar MADRS scores at baseline

 ;    The aim of this study was to examine the safety, feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an accelerated, high-dose iTBS, fcMRI-guided treatment protocol (SAINT) for TRD
 We found that SAINT significantly reduced depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in patients with severe TRD within 5 days, without negative cognitive side-effects or other adverse events
 The remission rate we observed is substantially higher than remission rates for open-label studies using standard FDA-approved rTMS treatment protocols (19, 45, )
 This is also higher than the remission rates that have been reported for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment (~48%) (5) and for ketamine treatment of TRD (31%) ()
 See Supplementary Table 4 for remission rates for interventions for TRD
 This remission rate was observed despite the inclusion of participants who had previously not responded to FDA-approved rTMS
 The high efficacy of SAINT may be The high efficacy of our SAINT protocol complements evidence from basic neuroscience research and human physiology data, which suggest that multiple optimally-spaced daily iTBS sessions have an enhanced effect compared to the same number of single daily sessions (2123, )
 Multiple optimally-spaced stimulation sessions have also been shown to produce accumulating non-linear improvements in clinical symptoms (52, )
 The duration of inter-session intervals appears to be vitally important as stimulation sessions with inter-session intervals of 50-90 minutes have been shown to have a cumulative effect on synaptic strengthening; whereas, sessions with inter-session intervals of 40 minutes or less do not show this cumulative effect ()
 Similarly, some studies have shown that 2 theta-burst stimulation sessions delivered to the motor cortex 15 minutes apart do not increase cortical excitability compared to a single session (51, )
 Finally, L-DLPFC activity has been shown to be correlated with sgACC activation 10 minutes after rTMS; this correlation was reduced 27 minutes following rTMS; and the correlation certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 e
 the hypothetically optimal time for stimulation
 Taken together, these data could explain the limited efficacy of a previously reported accelerated stimulation protocol for depression, which used an inter-session interval of The individualized targeting method used in our study may have also contributed to the high remission rate
 The L-DLPFC is a large brain area that consists of several subregions, some of which are correlated and some anticorrelated with sgACC activity ()
 A retrospective study found that the degree of anticorrelation between the stimulated subregion of the L-DLPFC and the sgACC accounted for over 70% of the variance in antidepressant efficacy of rTMS ()
 A recent interleaved TMS-fMRI study showed that when using individualized functional connectivity-guided targeting, stimulation propagated from the L-DLPFC to the sgACC in all participants ()
 In comparison, a separate study defined the L-DLPFC anatomically (border of BA9/BA46) and stimulation propagated to the sgACC in only 44% of participants ()
 A trial in healthy individuals induced the desired change in functional connectivity between the L-DLPFC and the sgACC ()
 Defining L-DLPFC using common techniques such as scalp-based measurements or structural MRI scans could result in stimulating a subregion of the L-DLPFC that is correlated rather than anticorrelated with the sgACC (58, )
 The limited efficacy of prior iTBS treatment protocols (30, 60) could be explained in part by the use of this anatomical target (border of BA/BA)
 By stimulating the subregion of the L-DLPFC that is most anticorrelated with the sgACC in each individual, we may have reduced this variability in signal propagation and maximized treatment The high efficacy of our SAINT protocol suggests that FDA-approved protocols could be under-dosing
 Our protocol administered five-times the pulse-dose of the FDA-approved iTBS protocol certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    (90,000 pulses in comparison to the standard 18,000 iTBS pulses ())
 Prior studies found that 61% of individuals who do not respond to an rTMS treatment course responded with additional rTMS treatment sessions (26), and higher pulse-doses are associated with higher efficacy (61, )
 A recent report demonstrated non-asymptotic negative linear relationships between the number of rTMS treatments and depression symptom scores ()
 Finally, the possible need for a higher pulse-dose is consistent with deep brain stimulation in other neuropsychiatric disorders, where ~500,000 pulses of stimulation are delivered each day ()
 This suggests that additional rTMS treatments might further reduce depression symptoms
 Our SAINT protocol applies the equivalent amount of stimulation as a 6-week standard iTBS treatment protocol (18,000 pulses) each day of stimulation ()
 Thirty percent of participants in our study met responder criteria after the first day of stimulation (n=6/20, daily HDRS-6 missing for 1 participant), which is equivalent to response rates for iTBS/rTMS for this treatment-resistance level ()
 None of the prior rTMS non-responders in our study responded after a single day of SAINT (see Figure 3); whereas, 83% of these prior rTMS non-responders did respond at the end of the 5-day protocol
 The need for higher stimulation doses may have contributed to the limited efficacy of previous attempts at accelerated stimulation approaches, which delivered much lower daily and total pulse-doses ()
 Our study administered the highest number of TMS pulses per day and highest overall TMS pulse-Prior rTMS non-responders in our study required more stimulation sessions to induce a clinically significant response
 It is possible that depressed individuals with a higher degree of treatment-may require a higher pulse-dose to induce an antidepressant response, and individuals with the highest degree of treatment resistance may require maintenance iTBS therapy (70) or even an implanted cortical stimulator (71, 72) to induce and sustain antidepressant responses ()

 ;    The combined short duration of our SAINT protocol and the apparent lack of cognitive side-effects provide potential benefits over currently available treatments
 Ketamine/esketamine and ECT are currently available alternatives for rapid antidepressant response but have several limitations
 Remission rates for ketamine/esketamine are substantially lower than the remission rate we observed for SAINT (7376), approximately 11% of patients report the dissociative symptoms from ketamine as very disturbing (76), and the opioid mechanism of action may pose a potential risk for some ()
 A large trial investigating the efficacy of esketamine showed a maximal 4-point average difference on the MADRS in comparison to placebo ()
 Although ECT is safe and effective, its use has been limited to less than 2% of eligible patients due to restricted availability coupled with concerns regarding cognitive side-effects and stigma (79, )
 Further, ECT often takes two weeks or longer to produce remission from suicidal ideation ()
 Our study has several limitations, including an open-label design and small sample size
 Without a sham-control group we cannot rule out that our results are primarily due to sham effect
 However, a previous study found individuals with high treatment-refractoriness, like many of the participants in this study, show no sham response to iTBS sessions of 1800 pulses ()
 Further, this study involved 500 minutes of stimulation; whereas, conventional rTMS involves 1200 minutes of stimulation time (10, )
 Thus, it would be expected that with less time in treatment there would be less of an opportunity for a sham effect than in conventional rTMS treatment
 The remission rate in this study is also substantially higher than previous open-label interventions for TRD; see Supplementary Table 
 Greater sham remission rates would be expected for DBS as sham response magnitude is related to the degree of invasiveness of the procedure ()
 The pooled open-label remission rate for DBS is 30% ()
 The remission rate we found (
48%) is substantially higher than this, suggesting that SAINT is either a more effective treatment or the SAINT procedure introduced an extremely high sham effect

6% remission rate after 1 year (84) demonstrating the low incidence of spontaneous remission in this population
 Regardless, a sham-controlled double-blinded study is required to define the effectiveness of our protocol in comparison to an identical schedule of sham stimulation Further methodological uncertainties include stimulation of a single brain region (85), fixed stimulation frequencies (63, 86), fixed inter-session intervals (86, 87) and the lack of state-dependent stimulation ()
 Individualized stimulation frequencies may result in quicker and more durable responses (86, 89), and different cortical excitability profiles may require different inter-session intervals (87, )
 Finally, recent studies have shown that applying stimulation in particular In conclusion, SAINT; our high-dose, accelerated and fcMRI-guided iTBS protocol is preliminarily safe, well-tolerated, feasible, and associated with a high rate of remission from depression, despite the inclusion of participants who had previously not responded to rTMS
 Our data suggest that current FDA-approved TMS protocols may be under-dosing and could potentially benefit from individualized targeting methods and accelerated delivery of a high pulse-dose via optimally-spaced sessions
 The efficacy of SAINT in treating suicidal ideation and the short duration of the protocol suggest SAINT could provide a means of rapidly ensuring the safety of suicidal patients

 ;    Figure 1: This figure illustrates the 3 factors that make SAINT different from current FDA-approved iTBS protocols: Individualized targeting (A), accelerated delivery of hourly sessions (B) and high pulse-dose [both per session (B) and overall (C)]
 The FDA-approved iTBS protocol involves 1 daily stimulation session of 600 pulses to the L-DLPFC at an intensity of 120% RMT for 6 weeks
 The location of the L-DLPFC is located using scalp measurements
 In our study, A) we used fMRI scans to target the region of the L-DLPFC (1) with functional connectivity that was most anticorrelated with the sgACC ()
 This was done, because previous neuroimaging findings suggest the higher the anticorrelation between the stimulated region of the L-DLPFC and the sgACC, the better the clinical outcome (15, 27, )
 B) 10 sessions of 1800 pulses per day
 1800 pulses was chosen as this is the only pulse-dose that has been explored in a blinded iTBS trial ()
 Additionally, 1800 pulses has been shown to produce long-lasting changes in cortical certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 C) The highest overall pulse-dose of any published study to date
 A dose-response curve has not been created for TMS
 A previous study showed 61% of non-responders to rTMS responded with further treatment (26) suggesting that FDA-approved protocols are under-dosing
 Our SAINT protocol delivered five-times the FDA-approved pulse-dose
