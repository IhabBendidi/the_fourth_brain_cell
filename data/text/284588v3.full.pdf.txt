 ;    Background: The prevalence of knee osteoarthritis is increasing worldwide
 Obesity is an important modifiable risk factor for both the incidence and progression of knee osteoarthritis
 overweight receive support to lose weight
 However, few overweight patients with knee osteoarthritis receive care to support weight loss
 Telephone-based interventions are one potential solution to provide scalable care to the many patients with knee osteoarthritis
 The objective of this study is to evaluate whether referral to a telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle service for patients with knee osteoarthritis, who are overweight or obese, is cost-effective controlled trial We randomised 120 patients with knee osteoarthritis to an intervention or usual care control group in a 1:1 ratio
 Participants in the intervention group received a referral to an service
 For this economic evaluation, the primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and secondary outcomes included pain intensity, disability, weight, and body mass index (BMI)
 Costs included intervention costs, healthcare utilisation costs (healthcare services and medication use) and absenteeism costs due to knee pain
 The primary cost-effectiveness analysis Results: Mean cost differences between groups (intervention minus control) were, $454 (95%CI: -2735 to 4206) for healthcare costs, $-36, (95%CI: -73 to 2) for medication costs, and $-13 (95%CI: -225 to 235) for absenteeism costs
 The total mean difference in societal costs was $1022 (95%CI: -2201 to )
 For all outcomes, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective compared with usual care was less than 
33 at all willingness-to-pay values
 Conclusions: From a societal perspective, telephone-based weight loss support, provided using an existing non-disease specific 6-month weight management and healthy lifestyle service was not cost-effective in comparison with usual care for overweight and obese patients with knee certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    Osteoarthritis is one of the fastest growing chronic health problems worldwide
1,2 According to the 2015 Global Burden of Disease Study, osteoarthritis accounted for 
9% of years lived with disability worldwide in 2015, up from 
5% in 2010, and was the 13th highest contributor to global disability
1,2 Knee osteoarthritis consistently accounts for approximately 85% of the burden attributable to osteoarthritis
1,2 Osteoarthritis also imposes a significant economic burden, with the total annual costs estimated to be $A
6 billion in Australia,3 
9 billion in the UK,4 and $US
1 billion in the US
5 The majority of these costs are attributable to ambulatory and Excess weight is an important modifiable risk factor for the onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis,6 and there is strong evidence that weight loss interventions reduce pain and practice guidelines recommend all patients with knee osteoarthritis who are overweight receive support to lose weight
911 Typically, these treatments are delivered using clinical face-to-face models of care
12 While such clinical models produce moderate effects on weight loss, pain, and physical function,7,8 only 22% of patients with knee osteoarthritis report receiving weight loss care,13 possibly due to limitations in service delivery and patient access to care
 Arguably more scalable delivery options, using remotely delivered approaches, such as telephone-based support, can maximise the reach of weight loss care and are more cost-effective to support weight loss in this patient group
 While telephone-based behavioural interventions targeting weight loss are used routinely in the general populations, the cost-effectiveness of referring patients with knee Given the scarce resources in healthcare, policy-makers are increasingly requiring evidence of economic value for healthcare interventions to make informed decisions about how to allocate approaches is important

15 The primary aim of the intervention was to reduce pain intensity, by reducing weight
 The trial showed no between-group differences in pain intensity, nor weight
15 Despite the absence of clinical benefit, conducting a distribution of differences in cost and effect and can show that an intervention is cost-effective when neither cost nor effect differences are individually significant
14 Cost-effectiveness analyses estimate the cost (saved or spent) per unit of effect gained
 Such estimates can assist decision makers in prioritising interventions to determine how to best allocate limited funds
 The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the aforementioned RCT, compared to Economic analyses can be performed from various perspectives including the societal, and healthcare perspectives
16 The societal perspective includes all costs regardless of who pays
 This frequently incorporates direct costs; intervention costs, plus costs of care unrelated to the intervention (i
 e
 healthcare services and medication costs), and the indirect costs; absence from work and impact on productivity
16,17 In contrast, the healthcare perspective only includes direct costs i
 e
 intervention costs and the costs of other care
16 In this study, the primary analysis was conducted from a societal perspective and a secondary analysis was conducted from the healthcare perspective

 Patients were assessed for eligibility during a telephone assessment
 Eligible patients were randomised to study conditions: i) offered the intervention (intervention group), or ii) usual care control group
  Inclusion criteria were: primary complaint of pain due to knee osteoarthritis lasting longer than 3 months; 18 years or older; overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI) 27kg/m2 and <40kg/m2); average knee pain intensity 3 out of 10 on a 0-10 numeric rating scale over the past week, or moderate level of interference in activities of daily living (adaptation of item 8 of SF36); and access to a telephone
 Exclusion criteria were: known or suspected serious pathology as the underlying cause of their knee pain (e
 g
 fracture; cancer, inflammatory arthritis; gout; or infection); previous obesity surgery; currently participating in any prescribed or commercial weight loss program; knee surgery in the last 6 months or planned surgery in the next 6 months; unable to comply with the study protocol that requires them to adapt meals or exercise due to non-independent living arrangements; medical or physical impairment precluding safe participation in exercise such as uncontrolled hypertension; and unable to speak or read English sufficiently to complete study The intervention included two components
 First, brief advice and education about the benefits of weight loss and physical activity for knee osteoarthritis were provided over the telephone immediately after randomisation
 Second, intervention participants were informed about the NSW to the service for weight loss support
 The GHS is an existing non-disease specific telephone-based health coaching service funded by the NSW Government to support adults to make sustained healthy lifestyle improvements
 Targets include diet, physical activity and achieving a healthy weight, and where appropriate, referral to smoking cessation services

 No other active intervention was provided as part of the study, however; no restrictions were placed upon the use of other health services during the study period
 Control participants were informed that a face-to-face clinical appointment was available in 6 months
 For this economic evaluation, the primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)
 Secondary outcomes included pain intensity, disability, weight, and BMI
 We measured cost in terms of intervention costs, healthcare utilisation costs (healthcare services and medication use) and work absenteeism costs due to knee pain
 The primary analysis was conducted from the societal perspective, which includes all these cost categories
 The secondary analysis was conducted from the All outcomes were assessed by self-reported questionnaires at baseline, six weeks and 26 weeks
 The baseline questionnaire was completed by telephone
 Week 6 and week 26 surveys were completed via telephone or mailed in the post as per participant preference

26 QALYs were calculated by multiplying the participants utility scores by their time spent in a health state using linear interpolation between measurement points
 Knee pain intensity was assessed using a 0-10 point NRS
 Participants were asked to rate their average knee pain intensity over the past week, where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst possible pain

 Weight (kg) was assessed via participant self-report and BMI was calculated as All costs were converted to Australian dollars in 2016 using consumer price indices
30 Discounting Intervention costs were micro-costed and included the cost to provide the brief advice as well as GHS coaching calls
 The cost to provide the brief advice was estimated from the development and operational costs of the call and the interviewer wages for the estimated average time (5 minutes) taken to provide the brief advice
 The cost to provide the GHS coaching calls was provided by the GHS31 and multiplied by the number of calls each participant received
 The number of health Healthcare utilisation costs included any healthcare services or medications used for knee pain (independent of the intervention costs) and were calculated from a patient reported healthcare utilisation inventory
 Participants were asked to recall any healthcare services (the type of services and number of sessions) and medications used for their knee pain during the past six weeks, at the six and 26 weeks follow-up as part of the participant surveys
 Healthcare services were valued using Australian standard costs and, if unavailable, prices were according to professional organisations
3234 Medications were valued using unit prices from the Australian pharmaceutical benefits scheme35 and, if unavailable, prices were obtained from online Australian pharmacy websites
 To gain an estimate of the cost of healthcare utilisation over the entire 26-week period, the average of the week six and week 26 costs per patient was extrapolated, assuming linearity
 Absenteeism was assessed by asking participants to recall the total number of sickness absence days from paid work due to knee pain during the past six weeks, at the six and 26 weeks follow-up as part of the participant surveys

 analyses were based on initial group assignment and missing data were imputed)
 Means and proportions of baseline characteristics were compared between the intervention and control group participants to assess comparability of the groups
 Missing data for all outcomes and cost measures were imputed using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations, stratified by treatment group
36 Data were assumed missing at random
 Thirty different datasets were created in order for the loss-of-efficiency to be below the recommended %
36 These separate datasets were analysed as indicated below, after which pooled estimates from all imputed datasets were calculated using Mean cost differences between study groups were calculated for total and disaggregated costs
 The cost measures were adjusted for the confounders of baseline knee pain intensity, baseline duration of knee pain, baseline BMI and number of days on the waiting list for orthopaedic consultation because the addition of these confounders to the regression model changed the cost differences by more than %
 Seemingly unrelated regression analyses were performed to estimate total cost differences (i

 A systematic effectiveness studies, exercise programs appear to offer the most cost saving but there have been very few reports of the cost-effectiveness of conservative treatments compared to usual or minimal care controls
39 Of all four trials evaluating lifestyle programs (including weight loss), none were cost-effective

40 In this study, all patients received in-depth education with the overall goal to enhance self-management skills
40 Patients in the face-to-face group received six therapeutic groups session (2-4 hours each), whereas the telephone group received only two face-to-face group sessions (-
5 hours each) and four individual telephone contacts (15-30 mins each)
 The study found that from a societal perspective the face-to-face treatment was more likely to be cost-effective at 1-year follow-up
40 These results, together with the findings from our current study, suggest that telephone-based care for patients with osteoarthritis may not be a cost-effective management approach
 Since many patients with osteoarthritis do not receive recommended treatments via clinical models of care,13,41 understanding why telephone-based interventions are reported to be as effective as face-to-face interventions but not cost-effective, is an important consideration to inform An important strength of the present study is the pragmatic RCT design
 The pragmatic design of the trial enabled us to evaluate the intervention under real world circumstances
 This facilitates the generalisability of the results and allows decision-makers to use these results to help guide future healthcare interventions
 Another strength is the use of contemporary statistical methods

 Firstly, the rate of missing data at 26 weeks, between 18% and 30% for effect measures and 52% for cost data is high, however, not dissimilar to those in other economic evaluations
42 We used multiple imputation to account for the missing data, which is recommended over complete case analyses, despite this, results from this study should be treated with caution
 Another limitation is that costs were obtained through self-reported questionnaires, which may have introduced recall bias, although the recall period was short (6 weeks)
 Lastly, presenteeism costs were not included, (i

 Although this study indicates that the use of a generic non-disease specific telephone-based service is not cost-effective for overweight and obese patients with knee osteoarthritis, the current evidence suggests existing models of care delivery are unable to provide recommended care to the large number of patients with knee osteoarthritis
13 More research into how to provide scalable models of care that are cost-effective is needed
  Interestingly, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for the management of osteoarthritis9 refer to general obesity management guidelines for weight loss care for these patients,44 and not disease-specific models of care
 Based on the results of our study, recommending general non-disease specific weight loss interventions may not be appropriate, or cost-effective for these patients
 A key feature of our study and that of other osteoarthritis telephone interventions is that they only provide support over a relatively short period (six weeks to six months)
 However, other general weight loss programs occur over a much longer time frame
