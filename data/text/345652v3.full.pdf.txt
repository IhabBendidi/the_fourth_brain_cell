 ;    Background: We explored whether the effects of nilvadipine on cognition were influenced by baseline Alzheimers disease (AD) severity
  Methods:  Exploratory analyses were performed on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) dataset (n = 497) of a phase III randomized placebo-controlled trial to examine the response to nilvadipine in very mild, mild and moderate AD subjects
 The outcome measures included total and subscale scores of the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive 12 (ADAS-Cog 12), the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes (CDR-sb) and the AD composite score (ADCOMS), an outcome measure recently developed to detect treatment responses in subjects with prodromal AD
 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers A38, A40, A42, total tau and P181 tau were measured in a subset of samples (n = )
  Regression  analyses were adjusted for potential confounders and effect modifiers in order to examine the interactive effects of nilvadipine and AD severity on cognitive outcomes over -weeks
 Results: Compared to their respective placebo-controls, nilvadipine-treated, very mild AD subjects showed less decline, whereas moderate AD subjects showed greater decline on the ADAS-Cog 
 Also in very mild AD, a beneficial effect (as measured by ADCOMS), was detected in the nilvadipine treated group
 Therapeutic effects of nilvadipine were also observed for a composite memory trait in very mild AD subjects and a composite language trait in mild AD subjects
 CSF A42/A40 ratios were increased in mild AD and decreased in moderate AD patients treated with nilvadipine, compared to their respective controls
   Conclusion:  These data suggest that very mild AD subjects benefited from nilvadipine and that future clinical trials of nilvadipine in this population are keywords: mild Alzheimers disease, nilvadipine, exploratory analysis, cognitive decline, cerebrospinal fluid certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;     Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting nearly 
3 million US citizens
 By 2050, the prevalence of AD is expected to reach 13 million in the US alone and 100 million worldwide
 The presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain are key hallmarks of AD (-3) and are also accompanied by cerebrovascular disease, -synuclein and TDP-43 deposits and inflammation (-)
 Recent clinical trials have shown that moderate AD patients, with established brain amyloid and tau pathologies, are unresponsive to anti-amyloid therapeutic approaches, although some trials have shown potential benefits in mild and early stage AD patients (-)
  As such, early and mild AD patient populations  Findings of the Systolic Hypertension in Europe (SYST-EUR) trial of 2400 participants showed that intervention with nitrendipine, a dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blocker (CCB) similar in structure to nilvadipine, resulted in a reduction of AD incidence ()
  A small clinical trial of nilvadipine in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients showed reduced conversion to AD in the subjects treated with nilvadipine compared to those on amlodipine, which, in contrast to nilvadipine, does not penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB) ()
  Preclinical studies in mouse models of AD have shown that nilvadipine improves cognitive function, lowers A production, increases A clearance across the BBB and reduces tau hyper-phosphorylation and inflammation (-)
  In vitro screening of over 1000 DHPs, using cell-based assays, showed that inhibition of A production is not a class effect of DHPs, as only a minority of them, such as nilvadipine and nitrendipine, demonstrated inhibitory action while others had no effect or even enhanced A production (15, )
  Nilvadipine is a racemic compound and an examination of the individual isomers showed both (+)- and (-)-nilvadipine forms to have beneficial effects on amyloid and tau pathologies in an AD mouse model (17) while only the (+)-nilvadipine has the blood-pressure-lowering effects through antagonism of calcium channels
  These studies suggest that the preclinical anti-amyloid and anti-tau effects of nilvadipine are not related to its CCB properties
  It has been shown that nilvadipine inhibits spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), which consequently downregulates amyloid production, tau phosphorylation and inflammation ()
  As such, nilvadipine may represent a novel, multimodal, disease-modifying therapy for AD
  To evaluate this, a phase III multi-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in Europe to test its efficacy in  In the NILVAD trial, when analyzed as a single population according to the protocol, combined mild and moderate AD subjects did not benefit from nilvadipine treatment
  However, subgroup analyses indicated that, compared to placebo-treated controls, nilvadipine-treated mild AD subjects (baseline MMSE  20) showed cognitive benefits whereas moderate AD subjects (baseline MMSE < 20) showed worsening of cognition ()
  These findings support further exploration of the treatment effects of nilvadipine in AD patients at the earlier stages of the disease
  Given the proposed amyloid and tau lowering mechanisms-of-action of nilvadipine (15, 17) and findings from other drug studies targeting the same (7), we hypothesized that the most pronounced beneficial effects of nilvadipine treatment would occur in the subjects who had enrolled in the study when they were in the earliest clinical stages of disease progression
 We therefore further stratified the study population by AD severity at baseline in mild AD subjects and conducted unplanned, data-dependent, exploratory analyses of the existing dataset from the NILVAD trial ()
 We anticipated that these exploratory analyses would help identify responsive subgroups of patients for recruitment into future clinical trials of nilvadipine or related compounds
 In a subset of the study population for whom cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were available, we examined whether CSF A and tau changes differed between nilvadipine and placebo groups  This 18-month phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 9 countries across Europe (see elsewhere for additional details (21)) and funded by the European Commission under a Framework 7 Programme Health Theme collaborative project grant
  A separate Scientific Advisory Board, an independent Ethics Advisory Board and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board were involved in the oversight of the trial  The study protocol and associated documents were approved by Research Ethnics Committee and Institutional Review Boards (IRB) for all study sites (see the ethics statement below for the full list of IRB by each country)

  A written consent was obtained from patients who had the ability to provide a consent as well as from the caregivers at the screening visit prior to initiating the study process
 The procedure for obtaining informed consent from a participant with reduced decision-making capacity was conducted in accordance to the national laws of each country and assessed by the relevant bodies in each country
 The sample size calculations for the main trial were based on the mean difference of 
5 and SD of 9 between the treated and control groups and previously described elsewhere ()
 The block randomization was performed using an online system hosted by the Clinical Trial Unit at the Kings College London
 Blocks of varying sizes were used
 The randomization was at the subject level and stratified by country site, see elsewhere for more details ()
  All study investigators and patients were blinded to the treatment assignment
 There were no interim analyses in  Inclusion criteria for the study required that participants should be over the age of 50 and have a diagnosis of mild or moderate probable AD according to the established guidelines from the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association Inc
 (NINCDS-ADRDA) and the Alzheimer's Association, and having a baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of >12 and  27 ()
  A total of 569 subjects were screened for eligibility and 511 were randomized into the trial with 253 assigned to the nilvadipine group (one dropped out due to blood pressure measurements being out of range) and 258 were assigned to placebo
  Of these 510 subjects, 11 were lost to follow-up and 2 withdrew consent, leaving 497 subjects in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) dataset (see Figure )
  Data from subjects in the mITT set were used for these additional exploratory analyses below
  At baseline, each subject was randomly assigned to either 8mg of Nilvadipine or placebo once a day, and each study subject was required to take the capsule orally after breakfast for 78 weeks
  The primary outcome measures were the 12-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scalecognitive sub-scale 12 (ADAS-Cog 12) and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes (CDR-sb), and these tests were administered at  The exploratory analyses of the NILVAD trial were restricted to the co-primary outcome measures of ADAS-Cog 12 and CDR-sb
  The mild AD group was further stratified by single point increases in the baseline MMSE scores ranging from 20 and above to 25 and above
  From this data-driven subject stratification approach, we identified three AD severity subgroups as follows: moderate AD (baseline MMSE scores of  19), mild AD (baseline MMSE scores from 20-24) and very mild AD (baseline MMSE scores  )
  The cutoff of MMSE score for the moderate AD category was chosen as previously recommended (20, )
 The nomenclature of mild and very mild AD was adopted in accordance with Huntley and colleagues ()
  These analyses also explored the potential impact of nilvadipine treatment on cognitive sub-scales of the ADAS-Cog 12 and CDR-sb tests
  The ADAS-Cog 12 sub-scales are: immediate word recall, delayed recall, naming, following commands, constructional praxis, ideational praxis, orientation, word recognition, remembering test directions and instructions, spoken language, comprehension and word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech
  The sub-scales of CDR-sb are: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care
  In addition, ADAS-Cog 12 sub-scales were further grouped into specific traits for memory, language and praxis based on the topography of tissue loss in AD depending on the stage of the disease, as previously suggested by Verma and colleagues ()
  Using this strategy, sub-scales related to each trait were grouped together to generate a composite variable for each trait (Figure A)
 We also calculated a modified AD Composite Score (ADCOMS) using the partial least square (PLS) coefficients previously generated by Wang and colleagues (25, )
 Briefly, PLS coefficients for each subscale from the  ADAS-Cog 12 and CDR-sb were directly multiplied by scores for each subscale in our dataset
 The ADAS-Cog 12 subscales were: delayed word recall, orientation, word recognition and word finding difficulty; the CDR-sb subscales were: personal care, community affairs, home and hobbies, judgment and problem solving, memory and orientation
 Since we did not have MMSE scores at follow-up visits, the MMSE orientation was substituted with the ADAS-Cog 12 orientation subscale by dividing by 8 and multiplying by 5 so that it was on the same scale as the MMSE orientation score
 Since the MMSE item constructional praxis accounts for only 
04 points out of 
97 of the PLS weight, this item was omitted from the analyses

 ;     Cerebrospinal fluid samples from both before and after treatment were available for 55 subjects and CSF collection was performed using a standardized sub-study protocol described elsewhere ()
  Briefly, CSF collection by lumbar puncture was carried out between the screening and the baseline visit (within the 21 day window) and at the treatment termination (between 78 and 82 weeks)
  The lumbar puncture was performed using routine antiseptic cleansing and anesthesia with the patient in a reclining/sitting position
  The lumbar puncture was performed using a Spinal Needle Quincke Type Point 
775 mm (7590 mm) that was inserted between L3/L4 or L4/L5 interspaces
  Approximately 10ml of CSF was collected in 15ml polypropylene tubes
  After gentle mixing, samples were centrifuged at 2000 x g for 10 min at 4C to remove cells and debris, and then 1ml aliquots were prepared using polypropylene cryovials and subsequently frozen at 80C until further use
 Levels of A38, A40, and A42 were quantified using the Meso-scale discovery (MSD) platform as previously described ()
  Levels of total tau and phosphorylated tau (P181) were measured using commercially available sandwich ELISA kits (INNOTEST; Fujirebio) as per the manufacturers instructions and as previously described ()
  All analyses were performed by board-certified laboratory technicians blinded to clinical information
  We applied CSF biomarker criteria using total tau (> 350 pg/ml) and P181 tau (> 60 pg/ml) cut-offs as defined by Hansson et al, 2006 ()
 An A42/A40 ratio cut-off of < 
82 was used based on the concordance figures with amyloid PET imaging (Blennow, unpublished data) to compare baseline values with the clinical AD diagnosis
 In this subsample, 91% of clinically diagnosed AD subjects also met CSF biomarker  The Gentra Puregene Kit (Gentra Systems) was used to purify DNA from frozen whole blood according to the manufacturers instructions and as previously described
  The EzWay Direct APOE Genotyping Kit, (Koma Biotechnology), was used in accordance with the manufacturers instructions; specifically amplified DNA fragments corresponding to different APOE alleles were separated by electrophoresis in a 3% Ethidium Bromide stained metaphor agarose gel
  All genotypes were then verified using rapid PCR with high-resolution melting analysis according to the manufacturers instructions (Novallele Genotyping)
  Apolipoprotein E genotypes were available on a subset of subjects (n = )
  General demographic characteristics across AD subgroups by treatment within the modified intent to treat (mITT) dataset were compared using either ANOVA or the Chi-square test, as applicable
  Mixed linear model (MLM) regression was used to examine the main effects and the interactions between treatment, time (time points of study visits at 13 weeks, 52 weeks and 78 weeks) and AD severity at baseline
  As we were interested in the independent contributions of the baseline AD severity and treatment effect over time on the cognitive outcomes, these analyses were also adjusted to account for the effect modification by gender and confounding by APOE (coded as those with the presence of 4, without 4 and those with no genotype information since not all mITT subjects had APOE genotypes available) and the confounding effects of age at which subjects left education (referred to as education hereon)
  To account for the treatment effect modification observed in the subgroup analyses, this model also included interactions between time and APOE; treatment and APOE; time, treatment and APOE; time and gender; treatment and gender; and time, treatment and gender
  Interactive terms were also included for education and time and for treatment and education to account for education imbalance across AD severity subgroups
  All of these variables were considered fixed factors
  Subjects and country were treated as random factors
  The autoregressive covariance structure was used in these MLM analyses
  The outcome variables included change in the total ADAS-Cog 12 scores and change in composite scores from the ADAS-Cog 12 for different cognitive traits, CDR-sb and the ADCOMS
  We also applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to minimize multicollinearity and achieve dimension-reduction for data on sub-scales from the ADAS-Cog 12 and CDR-sb for all visits
  This method was used as an unsupervised procedure for achieving data-reduction and for identifying treatment responses in subgroups of subjects based on their baseline AD severity
  The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy and Bartletts test for sphericity were used to ensure adequacy for PCA analysis (KMO value of > 
6 and Bartlett p value < 
 )
  Variables with eigenvalues of 1 were retained and PCA components (Factors) were extracted using varimax with Kaiser normalization for rotation in order to simplify and clarify the data structure

4 within each PCA factor were then grouped according to their association with a specific factor identified by PCA and then labeled as factors 1 through 4 (Figure B)
  These composite variables were used as the outcome measures for further analysis by MLM as described above
  Post-hoc stratification was performed if the interaction terms for treatment, time and baseline AD severity showed a p value  
 
  Due to the confounding by APOE genotypes or effect modification by gender, their influences were also examined by further stratifying the subjects by APOE genotype and baseline AD severity, and by gender and baseline AD severity
  Changes in CSF levels of A38, A40, A42, total tau and P181 tau were calculated by subtracting values of the samples collected at the final visit from the baseline visit for each subject
  Given the small sample size for the CSF subset, group comparisons using ANOVA were limited to mild (MMSE  20) and moderate (MMSE < 20) AD severity categories only
  P values  
05 were considered significant and all  Demographic characteristics of the AD subgroups stratified by treatment are presented in Table 
 There were no differences across AD subgroups for age, weight or for the time elapsed since the diagnosis of AD
  Similarly, there were no differences in ethnicity and the presence of the APOE 4 allele (p > 
 )
  However, there were significant differences in education across AD subgroups by treatment
  There were also significant differences in gender, with females being overrepresented in the nilvadipine-treated moderate AD group compared to all other groups
  Mild AD subjects having MMSE  20 were further stratified using a 1-point incremental increase in the MMSE cut-off (Figure )
  This showed that very mild AD subjects, who had MMSE  25, benefited the most after nilvadipine treatment when compared to all other MMSE subgroups, as indicated by the smallest change from baseline on the ADAS-Cog 12 seen in this cut-off compared to others
  We therefore stratified the study population as described above to allow us to focus on very mild AD subjects along with mild and moderate AD subjects (MMSE = 20-24 and MMSE 19, respectively)
 Changes in the ADAS-Cog 12 scores and the ADCOMS in response to nilvadipine treatment are modified by  Regression analyses showed a significant interaction between nilvadipine treatment, baseline AD severity and time (F =

  Post-hoc stratifications of the mean changes on the ADAS-Cog 12 showed a trend for (p = 
06 at 52 weeks) less decline after nilvadipine treatment among very mild AD subjects and a greater decline on the ADAS-Cog 12 among nilvadipine-treated individuals with moderate AD (p = 
 )
  There were no differences on the total ADAS-Cog 12 scores between nilvadipine- and placebo-treated individuals from the mild AD group (p > 
 )
 There was also an interaction between treatment, time and baseline AD severity for the change in the ADCOMS (F = 
16, p = 
 )
 Post-hoc stratification showed significantly less decline on the ADCOMS in very mild AD subjects (p = 
04 at 78 weeks), no change in mild AD subjects and a greater decline in moderate AD subjects (p = 
03 at 78 weeks) who were treated with nilvadipine compared to their respective placebo treated groups
 There were no differences on the CDR-sb total score with respect to the disease severity and treatment (data not shown)
 Since previous subgroup analyses showed an influence of the APOE 4 allele and gender on the treatment outcome, supplementary figure 1 shows further stratification of changes in ADAS-Cog 12 and the ADCOMS in very mild, mild and moderate AD subjects by APOE 4 status and gender
 Compared to placebo, nilvadipine-treated, very mild AD individuals perform better on the ADCOMS over the 18-month period irrespective of the 4 status or gender
   Responses to nilvadipine on memory and language traits of the ADAS-Cog 12 depend on the baseline severity  Regression analyses of the ADAS-Cog 12 sub-scales grouped as memory, language and praxis traits showed that the memory trait was significantly affected by the interaction between treatment, time and AD severity at baseline (F = 
18, p = 
04, Figure 5A) after adjusting for the confounders/effect modifiers as above

 ;    differences for the memory trait between nilvadipine- and placebo-treated mild AD subjects, while a non-significant decline on the memory trait was noted for moderate AD subjects treated with nilvadipine compared to placebo
  Once adjusted for confounders, there was also a significant interaction between treatment, time and baseline AD severity on the language trait (F = 
1, p = 
05, Figure 5B), with post-hoc stratifications showing less decline in the language trait for the nilvadipine-treated mild AD group only (p = 
03 at 52 weeks)
  There were no effects by AD severity, time or treatment on the praxis trait (p > 
 )
   Principal component analysis of the ADAS-Cog 12 sub-scales show benefits of nilvadipine on memory in  The PCA meeting the KMO-Bartletts test criteria of sampling adequacy and data sphericity identified 4 factors
  Supplementary table 1 shows correlations between these factors and the different ADAS-Cog 12 and CDR-sb sub-scales
  Among the 4 factors identified by PCA, there was a trend for an interaction between time, treatment and AD severity for factor 2 (F = 
98, p = 
07) loaded with the ADAS-Cog 12 sub-scales related to spoken language ability, comprehension, and word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech
  Post-hoc stratifications of the mean changes showed that factor 2 differed by treatment only in the mild AD group, see Figure 
  There was also an interaction between treatment, time and baseline AD severity for factor 3 (F = 
72, p = 
001) loaded with the ADAS-Cog 12 sub-scales for the immediate and delayed word recall tasks
  Post-hoc stratification showed that factor 3 differed by treatment only in the very mild AD group (See Figure )
 There were no significant differences between the groups for factor 1, which was loaded with all the sub-scales of CDR-sb along with several ADAS-Cog 12 sub-scales, or by factor 4, which was loaded with the ADAS-Cog 12 sub-scales for orientation, word recognition task and remembering the test instructions
 Nilvadipine treatment differentially modulates cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers depending on AD severity
   Baseline demographics of the CSF subcohort stratified by mild and moderate AD status are provided in supplementary table 
  Changes in CSF A42/A40 ratios were significantly different across nilvadipine- and placebo-treated mild and moderate AD subjects (F = 
55, p = 
02, Figure A)
  Post-hoc analyses showed that CSF A42/A40 ratios showed a significant reduction in moderate AD subjects treated with nilvadipine compared to the placebo control group (p < 
 )
  A trend for an increase in CSF A42/A40 ratios was observed in mild AD cases treated with nilvadipine compared to placebo (p = 
 )
  Figures 7 and 8 show group differences between nilvadipine- and placebo-treated mild and moderate AD subjects for CSF A38 (F = 
98, p = 
04), total tau (F = 
29, p < 
01) and P181 tau (F = 
30, p < 
 )
  Post-hoc analyses showed that in the moderate AD group, as compared to placebo, nilvadipine-treated subjects had significant increases in CSF A38, total tau and P181 tau after nilvadipine treatment (p < 
 )
  There was a non-significant increase in A42 in nilvadipine- compared to placebo-treated mild AD subjects
   Many clinical trials in combined populations of mild and moderate AD patients have failed to show benefits, possibly because different stages of AD reflect changes in the extent of the underlying amyloid and tau pathologies
  Frequently the same drugs that have failed in combined mild and moderate populations have shown suggestive benefits for subjects in early stages of the disease (7-10, 30), when the extent of amyloid and tau pathologies is considerably lower than for subjects in the moderate disease stage (-)
  Although analysis of the overall population showed no benefit of nilvadipine, our exploratory studies show that very mild AD subjects experienced less cognitive decline on the total ADAS-Cog 12 in the nilvadipine-treated group compared to placebo
  However, moderate AD subjects treated with nilvadipine showed a greater decline compared to their controls
 We also used the ADCOMS, which showed that the beneficial effects of nilvadipine were restricted to the very mild AD group
 An examination of different cognitive traits from the ADAS-Cog 12 sub-scales showed that nilvadipine had beneficial effects on the memory trait in the very mild AD group and the language domain in the mild AD group
  However, moderate AD patients showed worsening of the memory trait after nilvadipine intervention
  These findings suggest a differential impact of nilvadipine depending on the  The examination of changes over time in the total ADAS-Cog 12 scores, stratified by different stages of AD, suggested that, after 78 weeks of treatment, very mild AD patients treated with nilvadipine showed less cognitive impairment than placebo controls

 ;    AD subjects treated with nilvadipine showed greater cognitive decline compared to placebo
  Placebo groups for very mild and mild AD declined at a similar rate, whereas the moderate AD placebo group declined at nearly twice the rate of the milder groups during this period
  These findings are largely consistent with those previously reported for placebo groups in other clinical trials, in which a lower decline is generally noted in mild AD versus moderate AD subjects (34, )
  In any of the AD severity categories, there was no correlation between blood pressure changes and total ADAS-Cog 12 changes among those treated with nilvadipine (pers
 comm)
  This is consistent with our preclinical studies showing that the anti-A effects of nilvadipine are not  We did not observe an effect of nilvadipine treatment on the changes in CDR-sb
  Studies have shown that while the ADAS-Cog 12 test is useful at estimating progression in mild stages of AD, the CDR-sb test is a global impression scale designed for staging of dementia rather than quantifying cognitive change over time
  It is therefore possible that the CDR-sb lacks the desired sensitivity to detect subtle cognitive changes due to high test-retest variability for detecting cognitive differences (36, )
 Since disease progression in AD differs by the initial stage of the disease, it has been argued that the ADAS-Cog 12 and CDR-sb tests alone do not have the desired sensitivity to detect subtle changes in cognitive decline that occur in mild AD subjects
  Recently, Wang and colleagues developed a composite variable, ADCOMS, which uses subscales from the ADAS-Cog 12, the MMSE and the CDR-sb and assigns adjusted weights generated from PLS regression to identify their relative contributions to AD progression ()
 This composite outcome includes both cognitive and functional measures
 Many clinical trials now incorporate the ADCOMS as it seems to be sensitive at detecting treatment effects in the early stages of AD(38, )
 When we used the ADCOMS (modified to accommodate the absence of MMSE sub-scales), we observed cognitive benefits in very mild AD subjects treated with  Subjects in different stages of AD demonstrate differential decline in memory, language and praxis traits
  These traits can be mapped to the underlying brain tissue loss in AD in different stages of the disease
 For instance, neuronal loss in early AD starts within the medial temporal lobe (MTL), which is primarily involved with memory function
  With the advancement of AD, further degeneration occurs within the parietal, frontal, and occipital lobes, which are involved in language processing and praxis (24, )
  Our exploratory analyses of these cognitive traits suggest that benefits of nilvadipine were restricted to the memory trait in very mild AD subjects
  In mild AD cases, who are at a more advanced disease stage compared to very mild cases, we observed a reduced decline for the language trait in nilvadipine-treated subjects
  There were no effects of nilvadipine on praxis for any of the AD subpopulations
  In the moderate AD group, there was no specific domain accounting for the overall decrement in ADAS-Cog 12 with nilvadipine treatment, but rather there were trends for decline in all cognitive domains
  Over the 18 months, placebo-treated very mild AD subjects showed significant decline in memory
  This is to be expected since very mild AD subjects initially have the most functional memory, which is rapidly lost in the early stages of the disease
  The language trait remained largely preserved in very mild AD subjects treated with placebo, but continued to decline further in mild and moderate AD placebo groups
  The praxis trait further declined in moderate AD on placebo with minimal decline in both very mild and mild AD on placebo
  This is again to be expected as loss of praxis generally occurs after the loss of memory function as AD progresses
  Collectively, these data suggest that examination of appropriate cognitive domains relevant to the stage of AD might improve our ability to evaluate treatment effects in AD  Alzheimers Disease patients in the early stages of the disease have limited cognitive and functional impairment
  As such, currently available clinical outcome scales, such as those utilized here, may not be able to capture subtle cognitive changes, particularly in the presence of relatively small functional decline (26, 41, )
  As such, there remains a need for the development of composite scores for assessing treatment responses
 One such approach includes using the ADCOMS (26), which was recently utilized in other AD trials as an outcome measure in 18-month trials to assess disease modification by treatment()
  We also used the ADCOMS and found that nilvadipine treatment was beneficial for very mild AD
 Using another similar approach, we performed PCA on sub-scales from both the ADAS-Cog 12 and CDR-sb as an unsupervised dimension reduction method to group specific cognitive domains
  Factor 1 loading primarily contained all of the CDR-sb sub-scales and also the orientation sub-scale from ADAS-Cog 12, and remained unaffected by nilvadipine treatment
  Factor 2 loading contained language and word finding abilities-related sub-scales from the ADAS-Cog 12 and, as with the trait analysis, a trend for potential benefit of nilvadipine was limited to the mild AD group only

 ;    treatment in the very mild AD group
  Factor 4 loading contained orientation, word recognition and remembering test instructions, which did not differ between the nilvadipine and placebo groups in any of the AD severity subpopulations
  Collectively, these results suggest that memory was preserved in very mild AD and language was preserved in mild AD subjects after nilvadipine treatment
  We also stratified the study population by AD severity at baseline and by APOE 4 carrier status, and our results suggested that among non-carriers, very mild AD cases had lower decline with nilvadipine treatment, but AD patients in the moderate stage showed cognitive decline with nilvadipine treatment
  In the subpopulation that was genotyped for APOE, 4 carriers were (unusually) as cognitively intact as non-carriers at baseline
  Despite this, 4 carriers did not benefit from nilvadipine treatment regardless of the initial disease stage, which is consistent with the literature from other AD treatment trials ()
 However, the very mild and moderate 4 carrying placebo groups did not decline between months 12 and 
 Stratification by gender showed that both males and females in the very mild AD stage had less cognitive decline with nilvadipine treatment compared to placebo treatment, while females in the moderate AD stage showed a greater cognitive decline with nilvadipine treatment
  With respect to gender, moderate females did worse on nilvadipine than males
 This may be consistent with some other studies which show poor response to certain therapies in AD  Correlative studies of amyloid imaging with CSF A levels show that the decrease in CSF A42 is an early event in AD pathogenesis ()
  Longitudinal profiling of CSF A in AD animal models shows that, with AD progression, CSF A42 levels decline first but A40 levels do not fall until the very late stages of AD pathology ()
  In addition, recent clinical studies have shown that CSF A42/A40 ratios have a better concordance with amyloid PET imaging for biomarker-based diagnosis of AD than using either A42 or A40 alone (46), and that this ratio is consistently low in AD subjects with high brain amyloid deposition (46, )
  In the present study, in mild AD patients, CSF A42/A40 ratios increased in nilvadipine-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects
  The mild AD placebo group essentially had no change in A40 and A42 levels
  Based on the known mechanism of action of nilvadipine (15), we speculate that the increase in CSF A ratios in the mild AD nilvadipine-treated group reflects clearance of A42 across biological barriers since there was a trend for an increase in A42 levels in nilvadipine-treated subjects
  However, moderate AD subjects treated with nilvadipine had a decline in CSF A42/A40 ratios compared to their placebo-treated controls
 This was due to a minimal increase in A42 relative to a larger increase in A40 levels in this moderate AD group
 Nevertheless, a decline in CSF A42/A40 corresponded with the worsening of cognition after nilvadipine treatment in this group
  Based on preclinical nilvadipine studies (15), the observation of increased A40 and A438 in the moderate AD subjects treated with nilvadipine could be interpreted as increased clearance of these species, allowing shorter and more soluble A species than A42 to move out of the brain and into CSF
  However, we do not yet understand the mechanism by which nilvadipine caused moderate AD subjects to experience a greater cognitive decline than placebo treated subjects
  One explanation could be an increased production of A species, which is probably unlikely since A42 levels remained essentially unaltered in moderate AD subjects treated with nilvadipine
  An increase in CSF A42/A40 ratios was observed in moderate AD subjects treated with placebo and appears to be a consequence of decline in A40 without any further drop in A42, which is to be expected in such advanced stages of AD ()
  Total tau and P181 tau were increased after nilvadipine treatment in moderate AD subjects
  Interestingly, placebo-treated mild and moderate AD subjects showed a decline in total tau and phospho-tau, which is unexpected, but has been previously reported in a longitudinal study of AD subjects ()
  Together, biomarker data from this NILVAD trial suggest that cognitive improvement in mild AD subjects after treatment corresponds with an increase in CSF A42/A40 ratios, whereas worsening of cognition in moderate AD subjects is paralleled by a decrease in CSF A42/A40 ratios and higher total and phospho-tau levels
  With failures of most AD trials to satisfy efficacy criteria in mixed AD populations, exploratory analyses of existing trial data are justified and necessary to understand lack of efficacy and to identify if sub-populations exist that may have benefited from interventions
  The NILVAD trial was designed for the analysis of a mixed mild and moderate AD population and further stratification of the study population into very mild, mild and moderate AD was unplanned and therefore exploratory
  As such, these subgroup analyses were underpowered, particularly when considering the confounding effects of gender and APOE
  Nevertheless, analyses adjusted for these factors continue to suggest that very mild AD subjects responded positively to certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    nilvadipine on both the ADAS-Cog 12 and the ADCOMS
 Furthermore, analyses of the ADAS-Cog 12 sub-scales demonstrate that memory and language traits are beneficially impacted by nilvadipine treatment in very mild and mild AD patients, respectively
  Together, findings from the clinical studies and CSF biomarker analyses suggest a differential response to nilvadipine treatment in AD based on the severity of the disease at treatment initiation
  These findings are also consistent with the results of several other experimental AD treatments where only very early stage AD subjects demonstrated benefit, such as Solanezumab (7, 10, 30), aducanumab (8) and LipiDiDiet trials ()
  Consequently, the Alzheimers therapeutic field is increasingly targeting the early stages of AD ()

 Figure 2: Grouping of ADAS-cog and CDR-sb sub-scales
  (2A) Sub-scales of the ADAS-cog 12 test were grouped based on traits for memory, language and praxis to account for the topography of tissue loss in AD depending on the stage of disease
 (2B) Sub-scales of the ADAS-cog 12 and the CDR-sb were analyzed by PCA, which resulted in grouping of sub-scales into four factors that explained most of the variance in the dataset
 Composite variables were then generated, which included sub-scales identified in each factor by PCA, and were named factors 1 through
