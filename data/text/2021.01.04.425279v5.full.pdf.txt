 ;    In the light of legislative changes and the widespread use of cannabis as a recreational and 26 medicinal drug, delayed effects of cannabis upon brief exposure during embryonic development 27 are of high interest as early pregnancies often go undetected
 Here, zebrafish embryos were 28 exposed to cannabidiol (CBD) and -9-tetrahydrocannabinol l (THC) until the end of 29 gastrulation (1-10 hours post-fertilization) and analyzed later in development (4-5 days post-30 fertilization)
 In order to measure neural activity, we implemented CaMPARI (Calcium-31 Modulated Photoactivatable Ratiometric Integrator) and optimized the protocol for a 96-well 32 format complemented by locomotor analysis
 Our results revealed that neural activity was 33 decreased by CBD more than THC
 At higher doses, both cannabinoids could dramatically 34 reduce neural activity and locomotor activity
 Interestingly, the decrease was more pronounced 35 when CBD and THC were combined
 At the receptor level, CBD-mediated reduction of 36 locomotor activity was partially prevented using cannabinoid type 1 and 2 receptor inhibitors
 37 Overall, we report that CBD toxicity occurs via two cannabinoid receptors and is synergistically 38 enhanced by THC exposure to negatively impact neural activity late in larval development
 39 Future studies are warranted to reveal other cannabinoids and receptors involved in this pathway 40 to understand the subsequent health implications of cannabis consumption on fetal development

 ;    Cannabis is consumed most commonly as a recreational drug that is often portrayed as 47 harmless, yet the health implications are not fully understood
 The positive association of this 48 drug in the public eye is not a surprise considering extracts of the Cannabis sativa plant have 49 been used for medical purposes for almost 5000 years, especially for pain treatment
 However, 50 scientific knowledge is limited and despite controversy, some countries, more recently Canada, 51 continue to legalize cannabis for recreational use
 Cannabis has been reported to be one of the 52 most illicitly used drugs during pregnancy, with increase in consumption over the years, and key 53 compounds, -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), can readily cross the 54 placenta-
 We were especially interested in CBD due to the reported health benefits and 55 availability in many natural products including oils and food
 In the past, the negative impacts 56 of cannabis in connection to embryonic development have been principally associated with the 57 psychoactive THC
 In humans, epidemiological and clinical studies associate maternal 58 cannabis exposure to behavioural disturbances in the offspring linked to increased risk for 59 neuropsychiatric disorders
 In rats, maternal exposure of THC changed a series of behaviours 60 in the offspring, including water-induced grooming, increased light sensitivity and altered 61 exploratory behaviour
 Recently, the negative impacts of cannabis have expanded and also 62 include the non-psychotropic CBD, which disrupts motor-neuron development in zebrafish
 63 This study is in contrast to reports that suggest positive health benefits of CBD, by treating 64 The mechanistic pathway(s) by which THC and CBD are toxic are elusive
 A new study 66 linked these two cannabinoids to the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway in mice and zebrafish, 67 and appears to involve cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CBR)

 ;    binds and activates as a partial agonist two distinct classes of G-coupled protein receptors, CB1R 69 and CBR
 Both receptors are highly expressed in neuronal tissue where CB1R is localized 70 mostly in the CNS18-20 and CB2R in the peripheral nervous system21, although CB2R has been 71 also linked to the CNS-
 CBD has been reported to interact with CB1R and CB2R, but with a 72 lower affinity relative to THC, and rather antagonizes cannabinoid-induced effects indirectly 73 through other receptors-
 Additional data to illuminate signaling pathways of THC and CBD 74 Experiments are economical because many embryos are available, and exposure studies are 77 simple as compounds can be easily added and removed
 Further, embryos develop outside the 78 female and therefore not confounded by maternal physiology and variable transport to fetus
 79 Translucent larvae provide opportunities to implement cutting-edge fluorescing calcium sensors 80 and measure neural activity
 Past studies suggest that the endocannabinoid system plays a role in 81 zebrafish development-
 In addition, both cannabinoid receptors investigated here have 82 similar expression profiles in the CNS compared to mammals, with CB1R sharing a 70 % protein 83 sequence identity with the human homolog
 Therefore, the zebrafish is an excellent model 84 organism to further illuminate biological mechanisms
 Considering the anticipated effects of 85 THC and CBD, high-throughput quantification of neural activity following early exposures 86 would be of great interest
 In this study, the calcium modulated photoactivatable ratiometric 87 photoconversion (PC) to a red fluorescing protein only in the presence of intense 405 nm light 89 and high Ca2+ levels
 This conversion is irreversible, thus creating a temporal snapshot in a form 90 of a ratiometric red/green output

 HuC) and is a direct read-out of relative neural activity
 92 Initially, this innovation was not suitable for a screening tool as the photoconversion was not 93 efficient enough
 Thus, we have optimized the use of CaMPARI, such that the photoconversion 94 is more efficient and practical for high throughput well-plate-formats
 This allows our novel in 95 vivo assay to measure neural activity and potentially screen large libraries of compounds
 Our 96 results were supplemented with a behavioral assay obtained from the same larvae, which offers 97 an independent proxy measure that is related to neural activity
  98 Here, we investigated the effects of the two most abundant cannabinoids found in the 99 plant, THC and CBD, on neural activity and characterized CB1R and CB2R in vivo on the CBD 100 effects in zebrafish
 The effects of early THC and CBD exposure from immediately after egg 101 fertilization until the end of gastrulation, at 10 hour post-fertilization (hpf), were monitored later 102 in embryonic development, at 4 and 5 days post-fertilization (dpf)
 The concentrations used in 103 this study mimic plasma levels of human subjects with high cannabis consumption35-37, but we 104 do have to consider that the molecules have to pass from the waterbath through the chorion into 105 the plasma of the zebrafish embryo
 THC and CBD were studied individually and then together 106 to understand the impact of individual compounds by themselves and to partially mimic the 107 cannabis available for recreational purposes
 Further, we characterized the cannabinoid receptors 108 involved using established receptor inhibitors for CB1R and CBR

 ;    High-throughput assessment of CaMPARI is a reliable metric of neural activity
 115 In this study the objective was to gain insight in the effects of THC and CBD on neural 116 activity during early embryonic development
 We measured neural activity with CaMPARI
 117 CaMPARI photoconverts irreversibly from a green to a red fluorescing protein only if user-118 applied 405 nm light application coincides with high calcium levels (Fig
 a)
 Red and green 119 fluorescing CaMPARI are quantified as ratio (referred here as CaMPARI activity")
 We 120 expressed CaMPARI through a pan-neural promoter, elavl3 exclusively in the CNS and thus as a 121 read-out of neural activity (Fig
 b)
 Here, we optimized the use of CaMPARI zebrafish for an 122 most suitable for this platform at 4 dpf, which is a suitable balance of fluorescing intensity and a 124 CaMPARI activity was quantified and displayed as a heatmap consisting of the red/green 126 ratio in fluorescing intensities
 At 4 dpf, optic tectum and hindbrain regions of larvae showed a 127 clear measureable output, whereas without photoconversion CaMPARI activity was nearly zero
 128 To establish a baseline of near-zero neural activity, larvae were anesthetized with MS-222, and a 129 significant reduction (p<
01) in red/green ratio was obtained compared to freely swimming 130 larvae
 In contrast, drug-induced neural activity,  with the established convulsants 131 pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) or 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), showed a consistent increase in CaMPARI 132 activity, even at concentrations considered to be minimal when inducing seizure (Fig
 d,e)
  133 We benchmarked our CaMPARI outputs against locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae, 134 which is an established metric of neural activity

 ;    timepoint for analyzing locomotor activity, because younger larvae are largely inactive
 Larvae 136 were left in the same 96-well plate for assessing CaMPARI and locomotion
 Exposing larvae to 137 photoconversion with LED light the day before had no impact on the mean locomotor activity 138 (Fig
 f)
 Larvae anesthetized with MS-222 did not display any detectable swimbouts (Fig
 f)
 139 The level of neural activity correlated with locomotor activity and will be presented later
 140 Overall, these results show that CaMPARI, deployed in zebrafish larvae is a reliable high-141 We sought to assess how embryonic exposure to cannabinoids impacts upon subsequent 145 neural activity later in development
 Here, the doses of CBD and THC aligned with our previous 146 work13, reflecting high cannabis consumption in humans
 Comparisons of our dosage to humans 147 requires various considerations: (i) blood plasma concentrations of THC can peak up to 
25 148 mg/l while smoking a single cigarette35; (ii) the content of THC has increased in the past 20 149 years; and (iii) doses of intraperitoneally administered medical CBD can vary greatly, from 5-150 100 mg/kg, and daily maximum of 1500 mg/kg,
 The current study uses up to 6 g/mL of 151 THC and 3 g/mL of CBD
 Absorption studies using Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass 152 Spectrometry suggest that typically an estimated 
1-10 % of toxic compounds will pass through 153 We wanted to gain insight into the effects of CBD and THC separately (Fig
 2a), and 155 therefore each was applied in a dose-response format
 This validation was necessary as 156 CaMPARI has not been used in studying cannabinoids

5 hpf) and then washed out towards the end of gastrulation (10 hpf)
 158 CaMPARI was imaged at 4 dpf and locomotor activity was assessed at 5 dpf (Fig
 b)
 Animals 159 that were exposed to CBD at concentrations of 2 g/ml and 3 g/ml exhibited a dose-dependent 160 reduction in CaMPARI activity (Fig
 c,d)
 These reductions in CaMPARI output are substantial 161 when compared against the ~50 % reduction we observed in anesthetized larvae, where little 162 neural activity is expected
 Coordinated with this, locomotion was also reduced starting at 
5 163 g/ml and was significant (p<
01) at 3 g/ml (Fig
 e)
 THC had a similar effect as CBD and 164 also reduced neural activity at higher doses, 4 g/ml and 6 g/ml, (Fig
 f,g)
 Locomotor activity 165 exhibited a more extensive reduction at 6 g/ml (Fig
 h)
 We compared neural activity and 166 locomotion in the same individuals exposed to effective doses of cannabinoids and found 167 significant correlations (Fig
 S2; CBD r=
52 (p<
01) and THC r=
71 (p<
 ))
 Indeed, most 168 larvae, that displayed reduced neural activity also showed reduced locomotion
 Together, our 169 findings show that both CBD and THC reduced neural activity when exposed early in 170  Antagonistic effects of CBD on neural activity is enhanced when combined with sub-173 effective doses of THC
 Cannabis consumption during pregnancy exposes the fetus to THC and 174 CBD in concert
 In order to investigate whether CBD and THC have a combined effect that is 175 different from either compound on its own, neural activity was measured when larvae were 176 exposed to both cannabinoids, using the same timeline as the previous experiment (Fig
 b)
 177 First, various sub-effective doses of CBD were applied from 
5 to 
5 g/ml in the presence of 2 178 g/ml THC (identified as sub-effective in Fig
 )
 Preliminary dosage attempts revealed small, 179 but significant differences with p<
01 and p<

5 g/ml CBD with

 Sa,b)
 Locomotor activity also 181 trended towards a dose-dependent reduction during concerted application of CBD and THC and 182 was significant at 
5 g/ml with p<
01 (Fig
 Sc)
 Next, CBD and THC were added in a 1:1 183 ratio mixture at 
0 and 
0 g/ml each
 An enhanced antagonistic effect was revealed on neural 184 activity when both CBD and THC were added at 
0 g/ml
 CBD by itself at 
0 g/ml 185 significantly (p<
05) reduced neural activity (Fig
 3d,e) consistent with results in Fig
 2d, but 186 CBD and THC together, further (p<
01) reduced neural activity compared to CBD or THC 187 alone (Fig
 d,e)
 The combined effects of CBD and THC seemed synergistic in that CBD by 188 itself at 
0 g/ml, although significant, had a relative small effect and THC by itself at 
0 189 g/ml had no effect
 However, when CBD and THC at the same concentration were combined 190 neural activity was reduced close to the mean of MS-222 anesthetized samples suggesting no to 191 very little real neural activity
 Locomotor activity was mainly affected by CBD with no 192 additional reduction when compared to CBD and THC combined (Fig
 f)
 No significant effect 193 on neural activity or locomotor activity was obtained when 
0 g/ml of CBD and THC was 194 applied (Fig
 a-c)
 Due to the effect on locomotion, we also wanted to assess the integrity of 195 neurons in connection to motor axons
 Reticulospinal neurons in the hindbrain were stained with 196 RMO44 antibody targeting NEFM, an established marker for neuronal damage,
 Indeed, 197 RMO44 immunostaining was further reduced when CBD and THC were combined at 
0 g/ml 198 suggesting that both CBD and THC affect neuronal health (Fig
 S)
 Together, these results 199 suggest that CBD and THC are more potent in reducing neural activity when applied in 200 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;     CB1R and CB2R are both required for CBD-induced reduction of locomotor 203 activity
 Some reports suggest that CBD mediates its actions through CB1- and CB2- 204 receptors
 To test whether these two receptors are involved in the neuronal toxicity mediated by 205 CBD in vivo, we deployed corresponding receptor inverse agonist AM251 and antagonist 206 AM
 This pharmacological approach allowed the temporal specificity required for our 207 experimental design
 Both inhibitors appear to act with good specificity in zebrafish
 Previous 208 works support the specificity of CB1R and CB2R inhibitors used in this study,
 In connection 209 to CB2R, a recent study has shown that CB2 receptors are required for the action of AM630 on 210 zebrafish behaviour
 The impact AM630 had on wildtype larvae was not detectable when applied 211 to cnr2-/- mutant larvae, supporting drug specificity
 Moreover, AM630 treated zebrafish showed 212 very similar photo-dependent response compared to the CB2 knockout
 Similar in regards to 213 CB1R, because knocking out CB1R and inhibiting CB1R with AM251 caused a similar response 214 
 All three metrics measured (acclimatization, dark-adaption and recovery) for locomotion 216 displayed arguably the same rescue-pattern in cnr1-/- mutant and AM251 treated larvae
 217 Further, both inhibtors were used at nanomolar range in our study, which is considered modest 218 and ensuring a level of specificity towards their respective receptors (AM251, IC50= 8 nM 219 towards CB1R; AM630, IC50= 
2 nM towards CBR)
 As described previously, the 220 experimental timeline is as depicted in figure 2b with CBD being added immediately after 221 AM251 and AM
 When analyzing CaMPARI activity, our results revealed that the CBD-222 mediated reduction in neural activity could not be completely prevented with concentrations 223 from 
1 to 10 nM AM251 or AM630 in the presence of 3 g/ml of CBD (Fig
 a-d)
  In 224 contrast, CBD-mediated reduction of locomotor activity was prevented with a concentration of 225 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    AM251 as low as 1 nM (Fig
 4e) or with 10 nM of AM630 (Fig
 f)
 In the absence of CBD, 226 when using the maximum dose (10 nM) of AM251 or AM630, neither inhibitor had an effect 227 (Fig
 g,h)
 This finding excludes the possibility that the effects of AM251 or AM630 on 228 locomotion were independent of CBD and rather specific towards CB1R and CB2R, 229 respectively
 Overall, this suggests a role for both CB1R and CB2R receptors in CBD-mediated 230 effects on locomotor activity
 In sum, inhibiting CB1R and CB2R can ameliorate the negative 231 impacts of early CBD on late CNS function, at least with respect to locomotion
 232 In some jurisdictions, including Canada, cannabis has been legalized despite the lack of 235 mechanistic understanding and health implications
 Cannabis consumption has increased in the 236 past decade46,47 and reports emerged associating prenatal cannabis consumption with stillbirths 237 and autism spectrum disorder, a neurodevelopmental syndrome,
 Yet, cannabis and CBD oil 238 have been used by consumers to treat labor pain
 In animal models, such as rats and chicken, 239 cannabis has been shown to have detrimental effects on developing embryos10, 
 Intriguingly, 240 more recently, new evidence revealed that exposure to not only the more widely studied THC, 241 but also CBD, during gastrulation impacts the overall development in zebrafish
 Interestingly, 242 the effect of the two key cannabinoids, CBD and THC, were delayed, and observed much later in 243 In vitro, CBD and THC can function through CB1R and CB2R, which are expressed in 245 neuronal tissue-
 Our goal was to specifically investigate the effects of CBD, how it might 246 interact with the more widely studied THC during early development and characterize the impact 247 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    on neural activity in vivo on a mechanistic level
 For our study, we implemented CaMPARI 248 transgenic zebrafish as a read-out of neural activity and supplemented this approach by 249 measuring the locomotor activity of the same larvae
 CaMPARI has proven to be a simple and 250 economical neural integrator that can be optimized in a well-format using our animal model
  We 251 found that neural activity was reduced later in zebrafish development upon brief exposure of not 252 only THC, but also CBD early in development
 Surprisingly, CBD had similar impacts on neural 253 activity at lower concentrations compared to THC
 Notably, the impact of CBD was increased by 254 sub-effective doses of THC
 Our data quantifying locomotion, suggested that the CBD-mediated 255 We optimized CaMPARI such that this innovation can be used for large number of 257 samples to screen compounds in future studies
 Zebrafish larvae can be deployed in a 96-well 258 set-up quantifying locomotion,-
 Nevertheless, locomotor activity is not a direct 259 measurement of neural activity
 Calcium sensors, such as the GCaMP series57,58, the more 260 recently introduced GECO59,60, and CaMPARI, are more accurate
 CaMPARI provides a 261 temporal-snapshot of neural activity in the freely swimming animal, which can be anesthetized 262 and imaged after the experiment
 Furthermore, the ratiometric red/green signals are imaged 263 together and mitigate inter-individual differences in expression levels or focal plane
 We 264 optimized conditions for a well-plate set-up analyzing neural activity in the optic tectum and 265 hindbrain
 Unfortunately, less defined areas or specific neurons could not be quantified
 Effects 266 on motor axons will be detected by our behavioural assay
 In general, there seems to be a good 267 correlation between neural activity measured by CaMPARI and locomotor activity,
 However, 268 some findings may be more sensitive towards one assay vs the other, as described above
 269 Furthermore, when interpreting our data as neural activity, it is important to consider that when 270 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    anesthetized a clear red to green CaMPARI ratio can be still measured
 This is unlikely due to 271 autofluoresence because larvae that were not photoconverted yielded zero CaMPARI activity
 272 We cannot exclude the possibility that due to longer photoconversion some CaMPARI has 273 converted into the red fluorescence version even when anesthetized
 It is well established that 274 when anesthetized with MS-222, neurons are barely active,
 Indeed, our behavioural assay 275 shows no locomotion in the presence of MS-222 and we used this assay as a supplement in this 276 study
 We believe this method is a suitable technique to measure substantial changes in neural 277 activity in the larger parts of the zebrafish CNS
 For future studies in connection to epilepsy this 278 innovation may be particularly helpful as some studies use convulstants, PTZ or 4-AP, to 279 simulate seizure,
 We found that both, PTZ and 4-AP, induce CaMPARI activity
 Considering 280 the advantages, this method outweighs its limitation and could serve for future studies, especially 281 We have considered several competing technologies prior to designing this study, in 283 hopes that we can build upon and complement these potent approaches
 Other than behavioural 284 assays described above, the GCaMP series has been of interest,
 However, the larvae have to 285 be analyzed with high-resolution live microscopy during the experiment and movement of the 286 larvae would add considerable variability
 The assays would be data-intensive and technically 287 challenging, where large sample sizes and different experimental groups are difficult to obtain 288 (especially in vivo)
 Additionally, we were still interested in measuring outputs from freely 289 behaving animals as constraining them for imaging likely impacts the results and is time-290 consuming
 Other widely used markers for neural activity include the immediate-early gene c-fos 291 and phosphorylation of ERK,
 However, CaMPARI is more temporal specific due to 292 immediate photoconversion
 In addition, both markers are not only less tissue specific, but also 293 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    respond to stress and other factors
 The elavl3 promoter that drives CaMPARI ensures CNS-294 specific expression
 Overall, CaMPARI is a practical direct output of neural activity and thus the 295 Both CBD and THC have been implicated in embryonic development including abnormal 297 changes to neurons
 Delayed abnormalities after early exposure of key cannabinoids have only 298 recently been investigated
 Here, early exposure of CBD and THC during the first 10 hours of 299 embryonic development reduced neural activity when measured 4 days later, in a dose-dependent 300 manner
 These later effects may be due to abnormal neurodevelopment and/or the slow release of 301 the cannabinoids from the tissue due to their lipophilic nature
 Consistent with this finding, 302 zebrafish larvae with a similar exposure (5-10 hpf) to cannabinoids have shown effects that could 303 be due abnormal development (at 5 dpf)
 This was not exclusive to neurons, but included other 304 changes such as morphological abnormalities, decreased survival rate, decreased mEPCs activity 305 (may relate to muscle development), decreased heart rate and delayed hatching
 Considering 306 the specific time-window of exposure (first 10 hours in development), an abrupt effect on the 307 developmental program including neurons seems plausible
 Interestingly, CBD seemed to impact 308 neural activity at a lower concentration than THC, which also aligns with our previous study
 It 309 is important to acknowledge that CBD consumption has been documented to help with seizures 310 and cancer by reducing pain,
 Nevertheless, our study suggests caution during pregnancies
   311 Considering that cannabis contains large proportions of both CBD and THC, we looked 312 at the effects of these two compounds in combination and found a more potent effect in 313 decreasing neural activity
 Reticulospinal neurons in the hindbrain of the zebrafish control motor 314 neurons during swimming,
 In line with a reduction in locomotion, we observed reduced 315 staining when exposed to both cannabinoids, suggesting that the reticulospinal neuronal integrity 316 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    was compromised
 However, this finding did not explain why locomotor activity was mainly 317 influenced by CBD
 This could be due in part that CBD has a greater effect at lower 318 concentration than THC
 The effect of CBD may be amplified by effecting motor neurons and 319 potentially muscle development
 Overall, these findings were surprising, because CBD was 320 found to negate the effects of THC on CBR
 One possibility is that at higher concentrations 321 both, CBD and THC, affect the developmental program
 This could explain the abnormal 322 morphologies reported previously
 We have observed similar morphologies using higher 323 concentrations of CBD and/or THC
 Thus, it is of no surprise that abnormal morphologies 324 impacted neural activity and locomotion
 Nevertheless, because at 2 g/mL we found a 325 significant reduction in neural activity, but no morphological change was observed previously at 326 that concentration13, it is unlikely that neural activity is affected by morphological changes alone
 327 In short, we believe that although in physiological range, high concentrations of CBD and THC 328 during embryonic development disrupt proper growth and neuron function with similar 329 consequences and thus the effects of CBD and THC are same
 This could result in overriding the 330 negating effects of CBD
 In contrast, at lower concentrations and in fully developed brains the 331 impact of CBD and THC is different
 Indeed, several receptors have been shown to have 332 different affinities to THC and CBD
 A second possibility, therefore, is that at high 333 concentration CBD and THC affect receptors other than CB1R and CBR
  This could explain 334 why inhibiting CB1R and CB2R did not fully prevent CBD-mediated reduction of neural 335 At this stage, it is unclear what mechanism(s) account for the reduction in neural activity 337 later in development when embryos are exposed briefly to CBD and THC in the first hours after 338 fertilization
  In this study, we were especially interested in the less widely studied CBD

 ;    HEK cells several receptor candidates have been identified showing to interact with CBD
 A 340 recent study supports a functional role of CB1R and CB2R in zebrafish
 Here, by inhibiting 341 CB1R, and CB2R, we found that the reduction in locomotor activity mediated by CBD was 342 partially prevented at nanomolar concentrations of the inhibitors
 This suggests that, 343 mechanistically, CBD acts through both receptors
 Previous studies have implied that CBD may 344 bind to both CB1R and CB2R in vitro25 and our study is in support that these interactions may be 345 important in vivo
 In line with our findings, CBD has been shown to cause abnormal craniofacial 346 and brain development in mice and zebrafish, which seems to be mediated through CB1R and 347 the hedgehog signaling pathway
 Whether CB2R can mediate its effects through the same 348 pathway remains to be determined
 An explanation to why inhibiting CB1R and CB2R did 349 prevent the maximum effect of CBD, which is delayed, could relate to the fact that the CB1R 350 and CB2R are expressed very early in development and found on stem cell progenitor cells
 As 351 mentioned above, an early effect may impact the developmental program such that changes 352 persist until later, even if cannabinoids are no longer present in the circulation
 Such changes 353 may not be specific to the CNS as CB receptors are not only expressed in neuronal progenitor 354 cells, but in stem cells forming other types of tissues
 This could explain our previous findings 355 where CBD affected heart-rate and overall morphology after 5 dpf when exposed only briefly 356 during gastrulation
 The CBD-mediated reduction in neural activity was not prevented when 357 either CB1 or CB2Rs were inhibited
 While the reason for this is unclear, it could relate that the 358 effects of CBD are larger outside the optic tectum and the hindbrain, thus more visible when 359 quantifying locomotion
 As described above, our CaMPARI assay in well-format is not suitable 360 to resolve motor axons in detail, which have been shown to be affected previously
 It is also 361 possible that other receptors such as TRPV1 are involved26, but this needs further investigation

 ;    Overall, both CBD and THC exposure during embryonic stages had a negative impact on 363 later neural activity, which was additive when combined
 Together, this could mean that the 364 impact of cannabis on early development is higher than using isolated compounds and profound
 365 Our findings also support an in vivo mechanism of CBD functioning through CB1R and CBR
 366 We believe this study opens up a new path for investigating detailed mechanisms, including 367 other receptors, in specific neurons that are affected by cannabinoid toxicity early in 368 development and persist
 The accumulating evidence for prenatal cannabis consumption having 369 negative consequences on neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring3 has to be considered
 370 As the recreational use is becoming legalized and socially acceptable, more studies are warranted 371 to not only fully understand the impact on human development, but also the mechanisms of the 372 Zebrafish maintenance was approved by the Animal Care & Use Committee: Biosciences 377 at the University of Alberta and operated under the guidelines of the Canadian Council of 378 Animal Care
 The fish were maintained in the University of Alberta fish facility at 28C under a 379 14/10 light/dark cycle as previously described71 and all authors complied with ARRIVE (Animal 380 CaMPARI transgenic zebrafish were outcrossed with Casper strains not carrying the 382 transgene
 For experimental set up, embryos were randomly collected and placed in egg water 383 (60 g/ml Instant Ocean) in groups of 20 embryos as early as practically possible within

 ;    Stock solutions of CBD and THC were obtained from Sigma at 1 mg/ml dissolved in methanol
 385 Receptor inhibitors AM251 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA) and AM630 (Adooq 386 Bioscience, Irvine, CA, USA) were dissolved in DMSO
 Accordingly, zebrafish embryos were 387 treated with vehicle or compounds as close to 1 hpf as practically possible and removed towards 388 the end of gastrulation (10 hpf)
 Within experiments all treatments contained the same amount of 389 methanol or DMSO, specific percentages are indicated in the figure legends
 Compounds were 390 removed with several washes and egg water was replaced every day until CaMPARI analysis
 391 Not all larvae carried the transgene and were screened for green fluorescence
 An increase in 392 mortality and abnormal morphology was observed when treated with higher doses of CBD or 393 line were generated as described previously,
 We re-derived CaMPARI fish in response to a 398 4 dpf were placed in a 96-well plate containing 150 l egg water (made as previously decribed71)  403 and acclimatized for 2 h
 The central 48 wells of the plate were exposed to 405 nm LED array 404 (Loctite) for 300 sec at a distance of 10 cm
 LED array illuminated the plates entirely and evenly
 405 The plates were floating in water at room temperature to ensure that the larvae did not overheat

 ;    For imaging, the larvae were anesthetized in 
24 mg/mL tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222, 407 Sigma) following photoconversion
 MS-222 was washed out and zebrafish were rested for a day 408 The ratio of red to green fluorescent emissions (red photoconverted CaMPARI in ratio to 412 green CAMPARI) was interpreted as relative neural activity, as previously defined
 Images 413 were objectively obtained with an InCell 2000 microscope (GE Healthcare, US)
 96-well plates 414 were run using FITC (1 second exposure) and dsRed (2 second exposure) channels
 Blinded 415 experimentalists used ImageJ to quantify the fluorescence mean of the red (dsRed) and green 416 (FITC) channels
 The area of the optic and hindbrain area were quantified as those regions were 417 most consistent in the view
 A mask was applied to exclude noise outside of the CNS
  418 The same zebrafish larvae being placed in the 96-well plate the day prior for CaMPARI 421 analysis were objectively quantified for locomotion using Basler GenICaM (Basler acA 1300-422 60) scanning camera (75-mm f
8 C-mount lens) and EthoVision XT-
5 software by Noldus 423 (Wageningen, Netherlands) as described previously
 Briefly, larvae were  acclimatized for 3 h 424 and one hour of movement was recorded from each individual larvae in each well
 Beneath the 425 plate an infrared backlight source was located and the scanning camera above
 Activity was 426 defined here as % pixel change within well between frames (recordings were at 25 frames per 427 second) and quantified with EthoVision XT-

 ;    there is a correlation between level of neural activity and the the mean activity % within a 429 swimbout (swimbout size)
 Swimbout size was shown to increase in response to the convulsant 430 PTZ previously52 and here it can be a useful marker for neural activity
 Transparent Casper strain 431 zebrafish75 were unable to be tracked as ususal with Noldus
 Therefore, quantification of 432 swimbouts provided an additional advantage
 Clear movement was detected above the noise 433 treshold due to movement of the pigmented eyes
 Although the % swimbout is small, reliable 434 measurements were obtained
 Only clear swimbouts were quantified, which were set above a 435 treshold of 
1 % of activity
 Figure 1f shows that measuring the mean activity of a swimbout is 436 a useful tool in obtaining output that is clearly diminished in presence of MS-
 In addition, 437 the output also shows sensitivity in freely swimming larvae
  438 The zebrafish used in this experiment were of the Tuebingen Longfin strain
 Set-up was 441 similar as described above
 Following the experiment, larvae were stained with anti-RMO44 442 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal 443 GraphPad Prism Software (Version 7, GraphPad, San Diego, CA) was used to analyze statistics 447 from data obtained from our CaMPARI assay or tracking locomotor activity

 Additive effects in reducing neural 866 activity are also obtained at lower CBD concentrations while THC concentration is kept constant 867 at 2 g/ml
 (a) Exemplar CaMPARI activity heat maps obtained at 4 days post-fertilization show 868 an effect at 
5 and 
5 g/ml of CBD when combined with 2 g/ml THC (blue) compared to 869 CBD alone (red), as illustrated by quantifications in (b)
