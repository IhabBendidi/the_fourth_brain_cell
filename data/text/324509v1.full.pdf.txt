 ;    In the setting of a clinical trial evaluating the anti-HIV-1 antibody 3BNC117, Cohen et al demonstrate that rebound viruses that emerge following interruption of antiretroviral therapy are distinct from circulating latent viruses
 However, rebound viruses often appear to be A clinical trial was performed to evaluate 3BNC117, a potent anti-HIV-1 antibody, in infected interruption (ATI)
 The circulating reservoir was evaluated by quantitative and qualitative outgrowth assay (Q2VOA) at entry and after 6 months, prior to ATI
 Although there were no significant quantitative changes in the size of the reservoir, the composition of circulating reservoir clones varied over the 6-month period before treatment interruption in a manner that did not correlate with antibody sensitivity
 The neutralization profile obtained from the reservoir by Q2VOA was predictive of time to rebound after ATI, and thus of antibody efficacy
 Although 3BNC117 binding site amino acid variants found in rebound viruses pre-existed in the latent reservoir, only 3 of 217 rebound viruses were identical to 868 latent viruses
 Instead many of the rebound viruses appeared to be recombinants, even in individuals with resistant reservoir viruses
 By incorporating the possibility of recombination, 63% of the rebound viruses could have derived from the observed latent reservoir
 In conclusion, viruses emerging during ATI in individuals treated with 3BNC117 are not the dominant species found in the circulating certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Small molecule antiretroviral drugs are highly effective in suppressing HIV-1 viremia
 However, therapy needs to be lifelong because it fails to eliminate a reservoir of latent HIV-1 viruses integrated into the genome of infected cells (Chun et al, 1997; Finzi et al, )
 Significant efforts are currently focused on therapies, including immunotherapies, to target the reservoir to achieve sustainable ART-free remission (Churchill et al, 2016; Martin and Siliciano, )
  The immunotherapeutic agents that are clinically most advanced in this respect are newly discovered broad and potent monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) that recognize the HIV-1 envelope protein expressed on the surface of infected cells and virions (Halper-Stromberg and Nussenzweig, )
 These new antibodies protect against and suppress infection in mice and macaques (Barouch et al, 2013; Gautam et al, 2016; Halper-Stromberg et al, 2014; Horwitz et al, 2013; Klein et al, 2012; Shingai et al, 2014; Shingai et al, )
 In human clinical trials, they suppress viremia, and delay viral rebound in the setting of treatment interruption (Bar et al, 2016; Caskey et al, 2015; Caskey et al, 2017; Lynch et al, 2015; Scheid et al, )
 Most importantly, immunotherapy with bNAbs differs from small molecule drugs in that antibodies can eliminate circulating virus and infected cells through Fc-mediated effector mechanisms (Halper-Stromberg et al, 2014; Igarashi et al, 1999; Lu et al, )
 In addition, bNAb administration is associated with development of potent antiviral CD8+ T cell immunity in Infusion of VRC01, an anti-CD4-binding site antibody, in the setting of continued ART did not measurably alter the size of the latent reservoir in 6 individuals (Lynch et al, )

 We report on the dynamics of resistant and sensitive viruses in the latent HIV reservoir over a 6-month period prior to ATI, and the underwent ATI (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Fig

 Participants received four intravenous infusions of 3BNC117 at 30 mg/kg at week 0, week 12, week 24, and week 27 (Fig

 Leukapheresis was performed at week -2 and week 23 to collect PBMC for analyses of the latent reservoir
 ART was discontinued 2 days after the week 24 infusion
 Participants were not screened for 3BNC117 sensitivity before enrollment
 All participants had a viral load of less than 50 copies/ml at day 
 The median baseline CD4+ T cell count was 688 cells/mm3, with a range of 391-1418 cells/mm

0 g/ml (Supplementary Table 1) (Cohen et al, 2017; Scheid et al, Infusions of 3BNC117 were generally well tolerated
 One serious adverse event deemed not related to 3BNC117 occurred in a participant who required hospitalization for a psychotic episode associated with a new diagnosis of bipolar disorder
 This participant was subsequently removed from the study before entering the ATI phase
 Fourteen of the 15 participants who completed the study received all 4 infusions of BNC
 One participant received only 3 infusions because viral load results demonstrating viral rebound were available before the fourth infusion
 Twenty-nine adverse events were considered at least possibly related to BNC
 Among these, 3 were graded as moderate and 1 was graded as severe
 Complete data on adverse events is provided in Supplementary Table 
 In many participants, CD4+ T cell counts transiently declined during the ATI period (Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Fig
 )
 The adverse event profile observed here is similar to what has been reported in prior trials with 3BNC117 (Caskey et al, 2015; Scheid et al, )
 The average half-life of 3BNC117 was 
7 days, slightly shorter than the half-life of 17 days in HIV-uninfected individuals, but very similar to that previously reported for individuals receiving ART (Caskey et al, 2015; Scheid et al, The quantitative and qualitative viral outgrowth assay (Q2VOA) was used to examine the effect of 3BNC117 on the latent reservoir (Lorenzi et al, )

 Q2VOA was performed for 10 participants: the first 9 to enter the ATI phase of the trial (with the exception of participant 604, whose virus could not be grown in Q2VOA), and participant 
 Nine of these participants had samples available from both week -2 and week 23 (participant 609 declined the week 23 leukapheresis)
  The infectious units per million (IUPM) of latently infected CD4+ T cells among these nine participants at weeks -2 and 23 ranged from 
 -
9 and 
 -
0, respectively
 We found no significant changes in IUPM between the two time points for any participant (defined by a > -fold change (Crooks et al, 2015) (Fig
 b))
 We conclude that 2 doses of 3BNC117 administered over 23 weeks in the setting of suppressive ART does not measurably reduce the size of the To examine the molecular nature of the replication-competent viruses in the latent reservoir, we analyzed the latent viruses isolated by Q2VOA at weeks -2 and 
 An average of 
18 x 108 CD4+ T lymphocytes were cultured per participant per time point, yielding an average of 40 independent env sequences per participant per time point (Supplementary Table )
 Phylogenetic analysis showed that each participant analyzed was infected with epidemiologically unrelated clade B viruses (Supplementary Fig
 )
 The clonal structure of the latent reservoir differed among the participants analyzed and could be divided into three categories: dominated by a single clone (603, 610, 616), dominated by multiple clones (601, 602, 605, 611, 613), or non-certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 c)
 Overall, 57% of viral sequences in the reservoir were clonal, which is consistent with prior studies (Bui et al, 2017; Hosmane et al, 2017; Lee et al, 2017; Lorenzi et We observed clonal fluctuations that varied from appearance or disappearance of clones to large alterations in their relative size
 For example, a clone from participant 602 comprised 11% of the circulating reservoir at week -2, but 42% of the circulating reservoir at week 23 (Fig
 c)
 Utilizing the Q2VOA data and Bayesian inference, we inferred the IUPM of each clone at each time point
 In 5 of the 9 participants, there were statistically significant fluctuations within the circulating reservoir, indicating that the observed changes in the composition of the reservoir between the 2 time points was very unlikely to be the result of finite sampling alone (Fig
 d)
 However, these fluctuations were not correlated with the sensitivity of the outgrown viruses to 3BNC117, with some resistant clones decreasing in size, and some sensitive clones increasing in size (Fig
 d)
 We conclude that the size of latent reservoir clones in circulation fluctuates over a 6-month interval in individuals treated with 3BNC117 while on suppressive ART, and that this Participants received 2 additional doses of 3BCN117 at weeks 24 and 27 in the setting of ART interruption (Fig
 a)
 Viral rebound occurred between 2 and 17 weeks thereafter (Supplementary Fig
 )
 The average time to rebound was 
5 weeks, which was a significant delay compared to historical controls (p < 
0001) (Fig a)

 ;    For many participants, latent viruses exhibited a range of sensitives to 3BNC117 and other bNAbs that target distinct epitopes, as previously shown (Lorenzi et al, 2016) (Supplementary Tables 5 and )
 For example, viruses obtained by Q2VOA for participant 601 ranged from sensitive (IC50 = 
45 g/ml) to completely resistant (IC50 > 50 g/ml) (Fig
 2c, blue circles)
 Participant 616, who demonstrated the longest delay in time to rebound, harbored a reservoir that was both highly sensitive and of restricted neutralization diversity (Fig
 c)
 The 3BNC117 IC50 titer of the most resistant latent virus isolated from each of these participants correlated with time to rebound (p = 
04, R2 = 
44) (Fig
 d)
 Thus, pre-existing resistance within the latent To assess the neutralization sensitivity of rebound viruses, single genome analysis (SGA) was performed on plasma, and outgrowth cultures were performed using PBMCs obtained at the time of rebound
 For 7 participants, outgrown viruses from the time of rebound were identical to plasma SGA viruses (Supplementary Fig
 )
 Neutralization titers were then determined for the rebound viruses isolated from culture (Cohen et al, )
 Overall, the 3BNC117 IC50 titers measured on the rebound viruses were similar to those found among the corresponding individuals latent viruses (Fig

 ;    Plasma rebound viruses isolated by SGA were compared to Q2VOA-derived latent viruses
 Although some rebound viruses were closely related to reservoir viruses in resistant participants, only 3 of 217 rebound env sequences obtained were identical to the 768 Q2VOA-derived latent viruses isolated from 9 participants (Fig
 3 and Supplementary Fig )
 Moreover, the 3 exceptions were all found in a single individual (participant 602) and represented only 
7% of all rebound sequences isolated from that participant (Fig
 )
 Although the majority of analyzed participants harbored reservoirs dominated by expanded clones, these clones did not emerge in plasma upon treatment interruption
 Strikingly, even a latent expanded clone with complete resistance to 3BNC117 could not be found among rebound viruses (Fig 3, participant )
  We compared the sequences of putative 3BNC117 target sites in env obtained from plasma rebound viruses to Q2VOA-derived sequences from the circulating reservoir for the presence of mutations (Bar et al, 2016; Caskey et al, 2015; Cheng et al, 2018; Lynch et al, 2015; Scheid et al, )
 Despite the lack of overlap between the rebound and latent viruses noted above, rebound viruses demonstrated nucleotide and corresponding amino acid variants in the 3BNC117 binding site that preexisted in the latent reservoir
 These variants were often present at low frequencies in the reservoir and enriched in rebound viruses (Figure 4, red arrows)
 For example, all rebound sequences from participant 601 contain an isoleucine at position 459, compared to 33 percent of sequences within the latent reservoir
 In participant 609, all rebound sequences at position 371 contain a leucine, which is present in just a small minority of latent reservoir sequences
 On the other hand, there were only 5 cases in which amino acid variants found in the majority of rebound sequences were not detected in the latent reservoir (Figure 4, black arrows)

 ;    We conclude that while latent and rebound viruses are distinct, 3BNC117 binding site variants present in rebound viruses are frequently pre-existing within the observed latent reservoir
 Despite the fact that 3BNC117 binding site variant amino acids found in rebound sequences were already present within the latent reservoir, identical reservoir and rebound sequences were exceedingly rare
 While occasional rebound viruses were very similar to latent viruses, the average Hamming distance between rebound and latent sequences among all participants was 31 Since Q2VOA is limited by its dependence on reactivation of latent viruses in vitro (Bruner et al, 2016; Ho et al, 2013; Hosmane et al, 2017) we also examined latent viruses by a reactivation-independent method
 Near full-length HIV genome analysis (Bruner et al, 2016; Ho et al, 2013) was performed on week 23 samples for participants with Q2VOA viruses that displayed varying sensitivity, phylogenetic diversity, and clonal structure
 Between 9  33 near full-length sequences were obtained from each of 6 participants, for a total of 133 sequences
 For participants 603 and 616, whose reservoirs are dominated by a large clone, 85% of near full-length sequence env genes were identical to Q2VOA-derived viruses
 For the other 4 participants, the identity between near-full length sequences and Q2VOA-derived viruses ranged from 
6% to 
3% (Supplementary Table )
 However, we found no instance of identical near full-length HIV sequences and rebound viruses among the 5 participants for whom rebound SGA sequences were available (Supplementary Fig

 ;    which is similar to that for Q2VOA-derived sequences
 We conclude that intact proviral DNA sequences obtained from circulating CD4+ T cells overlap with sequences obtained by Q2VOA To examine the accumulation of mutations during ATI as a potential explanation for the divergence between latent and rebound viruses, we created a mathematical model to simulate this process (Supplementary Fig
 )
 For each participant we computed the frequency of mutations accumulated during the simulated rebound, where the time to rebound in simulation was within one week before or after the observed time to rebound for that participant (Fig
 5a gray bars)
 Using this model and including 868 env sequences from both near full-length sequencing and Q2VOA (Fig
 5a blue bars), we found only 7 rebound sequences that were within the number of expected mutations, and all of these were found in participant 
 We then analyzed latent and rebound sequences for the presence of recombination using the 3SEQ recombination algorithm null hypothesis of clonal evolution) among 7 of the 9 participants tested (Supplementary Table )
 In the majority of recombination events, the 2 parent sequences derived from the latent reservoir, and the child sequence was a rebound sequence; however, there were instances in which the parents were comprised of either a latent and rebound sequence or two rebound sequences (Supplementary Fig
 7, and Supplementary Table )
 Examples of recombinant rebound viruses are illustrated in Figure b
 Of note, there was only a single instance among the 27 latent parents involved in recombination events in which the latent virus was an expanded clone
 In this case (participant 613), the rebound virus that derived from this recombination event accounted for only 1 out of the 12 rebound viruses isolated

 ;    derived from a recombination event between two latent viruses that were singles (Supplementary Fig
 7 and Supplementary Tables 8 and )
 Taking into account the possibility of recombination, the observed distance between latent and rebound viruses decreases, and is often close to the range predicted by the mutation simulation model described above (Fig
 5a yellow bars)
 We conclude that in addition to the accumulation of mutations during ATI, recombination may account for the considerable genetic distance between circulating latent and rebound virus
  We enrolled 15 HIV-1-infected individuals to receive 2 doses of monoclonal antibody 3BNC117 over a 23-week period while on suppressive ART and to subsequently undergo ART interruption while receiving 2 additional doses of the antibody
 Our analysis revealed that the size of the circulating reservoir is not altered during the 23-week observation period before ART interruption
 However, the composition of the circulating latent reservoir varies significantly, in a way that is independent of the sensitivity of the latent viruses to BNC
 The neutralization profile obtained from the reservoir by Q2VOA is predictive of time to rebound, and rebound virus amino acid variants are frequently pre-existing within the latent reservoir
 Finally, although the rebounding viruses are typically absent from the circulating latent reservoir, the sequences of Antibody monotherapy in the absence of ART delays viral rebound and selects for antibody-resistant viruses (Caskey et al, 2015; Caskey et al, 2017; Scheid et al, )
 When participants in a prior trial were pre-screened for sensitivity and received infusions of 3BNC117 at time 0 and 3 weeks, rebound was delayed for an average of 
7 weeks (Scheid et al, )

 Rebound was delayed for an average of 
5 weeks, and an analysis of the reservoir by Q2VOA revealed that the delay in rebound by 3BNC117 monotherapy is directly related to the sensitivity of T cell derived outgrowth viruses found in the circulating reservoir
 Thus, the outgrown viruses obtained by Q2VOA are representative of the The size of the latent reservoir remains relatively constant over time, with a calculated half-life of 
6 years (Crooks et al, 2015; Finzi et al, )
 However, the discovery of replication-competent clones suggested a dynamic reservoir (Cohn and Nussenzweig, 2017; Kwon and Siliciano, 2017), and clones of T cells bearing integrated viruses have been reported to expand and contract over periods of years (Cohn et al, 2015; Wang et al, )
 Expression of viral env in individuals on suppressive ART is limited, and neither 3BNC117 nor VRC01 (Lynch et al, 2015) infusion altered the size of the HIV reservoir in this setting
 Nevertheless, there was significant fluctuation in the distribution of circulating latent viruses over the 6-month period before ART interruption that was not directly related to 3BNC117 sensitivity
 These changes could be due to homeostatic proliferation, stimulation by cognate antigen, or cell death
 For example, an influenza-specific CD4+ T cell clone that harbors a latent virus might expand after vaccination or exposure to the pathogen and later contract
 Alternatively, the observed differences could simply be due to changes in the specific T cell clones that happen to be in circulation at the 2 time points

 ;    Viral outgrowth cultures utilizing peripheral blood mononuclear cells are limited in that they only capture the circulating fraction of the reservoir that can be reactivated in vitro
 Nevertheless, even with limited sampling in 6 participants, there was a 
7% overall overlap between 133 near full-length provirus sequences amplified from DNA, and 513 sequences obtained from viruses emerging in Q2VOA (Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary Fig
 )
 Thus, there is good Although we obtained an average of 80 latent HIV-1 sequences for each participant, and 57% of these were clonal, we only found three instances in which the rebounding virus was identical to a virus in the latent reservoir
 However, 3BNC117 binding site nucleotide and amino acid variants found in rebound sequences were frequently preexisting in the latent reservoir
 The observations that rebound viruses are unique but contain specific mutations found in the reservoir appear to be at odds but can be explained at least in part by recombination between viruses
 Recombination is a major source of HIV-1 diversity (Burke, 1997; Robertson et al, )
 Recombination occurs when two RNA strands from different viruses co-infect a single cell, wherein recombinant genomes are generated by reverse transcriptase template switching
 HIV-1 recombination rates have been estimated at ~
4 x 10-5 to 
38 x 10-4 events per base per generation (Batorsky et al, 2011; Neher and Leitner, 2010; Shriner et al, )
 This rate is within range of that of reported HIV mutation rates (Abram et al, 2010; Ji and Loeb, 1992; Roberts et al, )

  By incorporating the possibility of recombination and estimating the number of mutations that might have occurred during the ATI period for each participant, approximately 63% (137 of 217) of rebounding viruses could have derived from the observed latent reservoir
 This includes 5 out of 9 individuals in which all or nearly all of the rebound viruses could be accounted for by this approach
 Thus, in 56% of the individuals studied, the latent viruses detected by Q2VOA or near full-length genome sequencing appeared to have contributed genetic information to the viruses that emerge at the time of rebound
 Recombinants were found in 3BNC117-sensitive participants and also in the participant with complete resistance to 3BNC117 (608), and therefore these events do not appear to be dependent on bNAb administration
 While expanded clones comprised 57% of all outgrowth sequences, in only a single instance did a parent recombinant sequence come from an expanded latent clone
 This could be because expanded T cell clones harbor viruses with reduced fitness, or because of differences in reactivation requirements of latent viruses in vivo and in vitro, such that latent viruses in large clones readily reactivate under in vitro conditions but are more resistant to reactivation in vivo
 The latter would be consistent with the ability of the clones to expand without undergoing apoptosis or pyroptosis, as typically happens during productive infection
 Finally, the number of recombination events observed likely represents an underestimate since we only considered recombination events within env
   It has been suggested that recombination may be important for the survival of reactivated latent viruses, which could exhibit decreased fitness either as a distinguishing characteristic of their certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 While our findings suggest that recombination does in fact confer a fitness advantage, our data do not allow us to determine when recombination occurred
 If the recombinants are preexisting but not detected in circulation before the rebound, it would imply that they are either extremely rare in circulation, or that circulating T cells are not representative of the reservoir
 If recombination occurs at the time of rebound, it may have significant implications for understanding the frequency with which latent viruses are In conclusion, by examining the effects of antibody therapy on the circulating reservoir we document its dynamic nature and its relationship to viruses that emerge upon interruption of An open label study was conducted in HIV-infected participants virologically suppressed on to eligibility criteria

 Reads were re-aligned to the consensus sequence to close gaps, and a final read consensus was generated for each sequence
 Sequences with double peaks (cutoff consensus identity for any residue <75%), stop codons, or shorter than the expected All env sequences were translated to amino acids and aligned using ClustalW (Larkin et al, )
 The HXB2 (K03455) env sequence was used as a reference for numbering the amino acids
 Frequency plots were produced for each env position targeted by 3BNC117 (Zhou et al, Clonal composition shifts between time points in individual participants
 We employed a statistical test to gauge whether such changes in composition could be explained by finite sampling alone, or whether they indicated real changes in the relative proportions of each clone in the reservoir
 For this analysis, the counts for all sequences that were only observed once across time points were merged together in a group of singles
 All other sequence counts were considered separately
 We used Fishers exact test, implemented in R, to determine whether the counts of each clone (including the singles) observed at each time point were consistent with a single underlying distribution for both time points

 ;    the particular Q2VOA run from which each member of the clone was isolated, as previously described (Lorenzi et al, )
 Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo was implemented in Stan, using four separate chains of 105 iterations
 The first 50000 iterations for each chain were Rebounding viral sequences were rarely identical to those observed in viral outgrowth assays or by near full-length sequencing
 To understand whether the differences between rebound sequences and those in the observed reservoir might be attributed to mutations accumulated during the rebound process, or whether the rebound virus was instead likely to have originated from clones that were not previously observed we developed a stochastic mutation simulation The model is based on that of Hill and collaborators (Hill et al, )
 We begin with a population of 106 latently infected cells
 Latent viruses can reactivate with rate A, in which case the latently infected cell becomes actively infected
 The product of these two parameters (the number of latently infected cells and the reactivation rate) gives the approximate number of reactivation events per day
 Actively infected cells die with rate d, without infecting other cells, or burst with rate b
 In the latter case the actively infected cell also dies, but the release of virions results in the active infection of c new cells
 During each burst event, the number of new infected cells c is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution
 In principle, latently infected cells could also die or homeostatically expand, but we assume that such processes typically occur at much slower rates than the fast replication dynamics of actively-infected cells
 Therefore, they are not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    expected to contribute substantially to the rebound process, so we do not include these The underlying parameters (reactivation rate, death rate of actively infected cells, etc
) are not perfectly constrained by experiment, and may vary between individuals
 Following the approach of Hill et al (Hill et al, 2014), we therefore choose the net growth rate of rebound virus, the ratio of the variance to the mean number of new infected cells during a cell bursting event, and the rate of reactivation of latently infected cells, to be random within the bounds of experimental constraints (see Hill et al for further details)
 In addition to these parameters, we also allow the net death rate of actively infected cells to vary, which was not included in the analysis of Hill et al We use the results of Markowitz et al (Markowitz et al, 2003) to constrain the death rate of infected cells, which was estimated to be approximately 1 day-1 with a standard deviation of 
3 In addition to this simple model tracking the number of latent and actively infected cells, we also consider evolution of the virus at the sequence level
 In order to compare with the data obtained in this study, we assume a sequence length for Env of 2600 base pairs
 We are specifically interested in the accumulation of de novo mutations during the rebound process
 We therefore treat the length 2600 sequences as binary, where zeros represent nucleotides that are the same as the source sequence from the latent reservoir, and ones represent a mutation
 This approximation is justified because the number of mutations observed is much smaller than the length of the sequence, and thus the probability of back mutations is very small

 The probability of mutation per site per new infection event is 310-5 (Sanjuan et al, )
 In addition we allow for the possibility of recombination between sequences, with a probability of crossover between strands of 
410-5 per site per new infection event (Neher and Leitner, )
 This probability also implicitly includes the probability of For simplicity, we assume that mutations have no effect on the fitness (or replication rate) of the virus
 However, it is known that nonsynonymous mutations are often strongly deleterious, including in HIV (Haddox et al, 2016; Loeb et al, 1989; Louie et al, 2018; Zanini et al, )
 Thus, our assumption of neutrality likely overestimates the true number of mutations that would We simulate this stochastic rebound process until either the number of actively infected cells reaches 3105, corresponding roughly to a threshold of detection for virus in the blood around 200 copies mL-1 (Hill et al, 2014), or until the total simulation time reaches 100 days
 We repeated these simulations using 104 random sets of parameters as described above
 Different parameter choices and stochastic effects lead to a range of observed rebound times (Supplementary Fig
 )
 At the end of each simulation, we also record the distribution of the number of mutations accumulated during the rebound process
 As expected, the average number of accumulated mutations in the rebound sequences increases with the rebound time, though certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    In order to conservatively estimate the true distance (in terms of number of mutations) between rebound sequences and those in the reservoir, we counted each observed variant in rebound sequences as a mutation only if it did not match with any of the nucleotides at that site in the observed reservoir sequences
 This prevents us from computing spuriously large mutational distances simply due to recombination between diverse sequences in the reservoir during the rebound process
 The estimated rate of recombination in HIV is high, comparable to the mutation rate (Neher and Leitner, 2010), and thus the possibility of recombination cannot be simply neglected
 Indeed, tests for signatures of recombination (Lam et al, 2018) in the rebound sequences found multiple likely recombination events for all patients in this study except for 603 Code used for these simulations is available on GitHub at Sequence data that support the findings of this study have been deposited in GenBank with the We thank all study participants who devoted time to our research, and members of the Nussenzweig lab, especially Lilian Cohn, Yotam Bar-On, Till Schoofs, and Jill Horowitz for helpful discussions
