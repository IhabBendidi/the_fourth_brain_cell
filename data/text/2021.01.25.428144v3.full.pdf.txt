 High exposure to microplastic fibers in nylon flock workers has 33 been linked to the development of airway and interstitial lung disease, but the exact 34 health effects of microplastic fibers on the lungs are unknown
 Here we determined effects 35 of polyester and nylon textile microplastic fibers on airway and alveolar epithelial cells 36 using human and murine lung organoids
 We observed that particularly nylon microfibers 37 had a negative impact on the growth and development of airway organoids
 We 38 demonstrated that this effect was mediated by components leaking from nylon
 39 Moreover, our data suggested that microplastic textile fibers may especially harm the 40 developing airways or airways undergoing repair
 Our results call for a need to assess 41 exposure and inhalation levels in indoor environments to accurately determine the actual 42 Airborne fibers shed from synthetic textiles, in particular nylon, can inhibit repair of the cells 47 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 High amounts of microplastics have been found in marine environments, air, 52 soils, plants, and animals, which illustrates how omnipresent this relatively recent 53 pollution actually is ()
 Microplastic pollution derives from personal care products, 54 synthetic clothes, and degradation of macroplastics (3, )
 Synthetic textile fibers are one 55 of the most prevalent types of microplastic waste observed, with an annual production of 56 60 million metric tons, which equals 16% of the worlds plastic pollution ()
 These fibers 57 are typically composed of nylon or polyester and are released into the environment by 58 wear and tear and during washing and drying of garments (-)
 59 The ubiquitous nature of microplastics in the environment inevitably leads to human 60 exposure, which can occur through two main routes (7, )
 Firstly, through ingestion of 61 contaminated food and water and secondly via inhalation
 Microplastics have been 62 reported both in indoor and outdoor air, with levels indoors being 2-5 times higher as 63 compared to outdoors (9, )
 Whether or not microfibers can deposit in lung tissue 64 largely depends on the aerodynamic diameter of the fibers (7, )
 Lung deposition is most 65 efficiently achieved with aerodynamic diameters between 1-10 m (12), however, these 66 sizes are difficult to quantify in environmental samples due to limitations of the analytical 67 techniques (9, )
 Yet, plastic microfibers have been found in human lung tissue, 68 suggesting inhalation does indeed take place ()
 Furthermore, several studies from 69 workers in synthetic textile, flock and (poly)vinyl chloride industries suggest that inhalation 70 of such microfibers is harmful, as around 30% of factory workers developed work-related 71 airway and interstitial lung disease (-)
 Moreover, exposure to particulate matter in air 72 pollution, also containing microplastics (24-26), has been associated with higher risk of 73 developing asthma and an increase in asthma symptoms in areas with higher levels of 74 Despite the potential capacity for microplastic fibers to contribute to respiratory diseases, 76 the health effects are greatly understudied and information providing evidence of 77 potential human health effects of inhaled microplastics is lacking (9, 30, )
 In the present 78 study, we therefore explored whether textile microplastic fibers can cause damage to lung 79 tissue

 ;    Manuscript van Dijk et al                    Page 4 of 60 investigated effects of polyester and nylon microfibers on lung epithelial proliferation, 81 differentiation, and repair processes
 For this we used lung organoids that are grown from 82 primary lung epithelial progenitor cells with support of a lung fibroblast cell line (32, )
 83 The epithelial progenitors can develop into organoids consisting of alveolar epithelial cells 84 or organoids consisting of airway epithelial cells with help of growth factors produced by 85 fibroblasts
 We found that in particular nylon microfibers negatively impacted developing 86 airway organoids, while developing alveolar organoids and already developed organoids of 87 both types appeared to be less affected
 This negative effect was caused by still unknown 88 leachates from nylon that particularly inhibit differentiation of airway epithelial cells
 We 89 therefore call for assessment of exposure levels in indoor environments and actual lung 90 deposition to accurately determine the risk of these fibers to human health

 We particularly focused on polyester and nylon, because these are 97 the most abundant types of microplastics indoors (9, -)
 As we spend the majority of 98 our time indoors, we may therefore be exposed most to these types of microplastics ()
 99 Fibers are commonly defined as having a length to diameter ratio of 3:1 ()
 The fibers we 100 produced had a median size of 15x52 m for polyester and 12x31 m for nylon (Table S)
 101 Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) we found these fibers to be rod-shaped with a 102 circular cross-section and had a smooth surface (Figure 1A and B)
 For our polyester fibers 103 energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirmed the presence of carbon and oxygen 104 (Figure SA)

 116 Airways are lined with ciliated pseudostratified epithelium consisting of basal cells, ciliated 117 cells, and secretory cells like goblet cells and club cells, while alveoli consist of alveolar 118 epithelial cells type I and II (AECI and AECII)
 Basal cells and club cells have stem cell-like 119 abilities and basal cells can give rise to all important epithelial cells lining the airways, 120 while club cells can develop into ciliated cells, goblet cells, and AECII (41, )
 AECII can 121 behave as alveolar stem cells and can proliferate and develop into AECI ()
 The lung 122 organoids we used in these studies self-assemble from the lung epithelial progenitor/stem 123 cells isolated from adult lung tissue, i
 e
 basal cells, club cells and AECII
 The growth of 124 organoids from these progenitor cells is supported by proliferation and differentiation 125 enhancers produced by epithelial cells themselves and fibroblasts also present in our 3D 126 We first assessed the effects of several doses of fibers on organoid growth ranging from 128 2000-5000 fibers per well (Figure S)
 The fibers were dispersed into liquid Matrigel at the 129 same time as the isolated epithelial cells and fibroblasts were added, after which the 130 Matrigel solidifies and epithelial progenitors start to form organoids
 Based on these 131 results we continued with 5000 polyester or 5000 nylon fibers per well, equivalent to 122 132 g/ml polyester and 39 g/ml nylon, as this concentration had clear effects and was on the 133 lower end of the spectrum of concentrations used in other studies ()
  134 Murine lung organoids develop into two distinct phenotypes, i
 e
 acetylated -tubulin-135 positive airway organoids (Figure 2A) and prosurfactant protein C-positive alveolar 136 organoids (Figure B)
 We assessed the effects of the two types of fibers on these two 137 structures separately
 Exposure during 14 days to either polyester or nylon microfibers 138 resulted in significantly fewer organoids (Figure 2C) compared to untreated controls 139 (Figure 2D and E)
 The effect of nylon on airway organoids was most profound of the two 140 types of plastic and the two types of structures
 Moreover, both airway and alveolar 141 organoids were significantly smaller in size following nylon microfiber exposure as 142 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

05 169 Having observed these effects after exposure to reference microfibers, we next performed 172 similar experiments using environmentally relevant polyester and nylon fibers on murine 173 lung organoids
 These were made from white polyester and nylon fabrics purchased in a 174 local fabric store and cut to sizes approximating the reference fibers
 First, we 175 characterized morphology and chemical composition of these fibers
 For polyester, we 176 observed a more heterogeneous size distribution as compared to the reference fibers, 177 with fibers having a median size of 17x63 m (Figure 4A, Table S2), but a comparable EDX 178 and FTIR spectrum (Figure S3A and B)
 The nylon fibers had a disk-shaped appearance but 179 similar dimensions as the reference nylon fibers (median 57x20 m, Table S)

 203 Therefore, we added nylon reference microfibers either on top of the Matrigel after it had 204 set, thereby preventing direct contact with the cells, or added leachate of these fibers to 205 the medium surrounding the Matrigel for 14 days
 Interestingly, even when excluding 206 physical contact between the fibers and the cells or simply exposing the cells to medium 207 with leachate, the same effects on airway organoids were observed as when the forming 208 organoids were directly exposed to the fibers
 We found significantly fewer airway 209 organoids in the presence of nylon microfibers on top of the gel or their leachate (Figure 210 6A and B) compared to having the fibers inside the Matrigel
 The number of alveolar 211 organoids, on the other hand, was unaffected (fibers on top) or even induced (leachate, 212 Figure 6A and C) compared to having the fibers inside the Matrigel
 Additionally, the size of 213 these airway organoids was smaller as compared to untreated control organoids (Figure 214 6D), while only slightly inhibiting the size of the alveolar organoids (Figure E)

 ;    Manuscript van Dijk et al                    Page 13 of 60 The strong effects observed with the leachate suggested that some components and/or 229 degradation products may leak and/or form during fiber ageing at C
 Thus in order to 230 determine the chemical identity of the components leaching from nylon reference 231 microfibers we used mass spectrometry analysis
 This revealed high concentrations of 232 cyclic nylon oligomers (mono-, di- and trimers) in the leachate of nylon microfibers (Figure 233 S4A), which are known to develop as by-products during the production of nylon ()
 234 However, when exposing murine lung organoids to different concentrations of these 235 isolated oligomers separately or in combination, we observed no effects on either number 236 or size of organoids (Figure S4B-E showing the highest concentration that has been tested)
 237 These data suggest that other components in nylon leachate are causing the inhibitory 238 effects on organoid growth
 Recent work by Sait and Srensen and colleagues showed that 239 the most abundant chemicals leaching from nylon are bisphenol A and benzophenone-3 240 (45, )
 However, we could not detect these in our leachate, suggesting that if they are 241 present, they are so in minute quantities
 Initial experiments incubating organoids with 242 different concentrations of bisphenol A or benzophenone-3 did not show effects on 243 organoid growth of either of them suggesting they are indeed not the culprits in our 244 As our experimental set-up specifically studied effects of microplastic fibers on developing 248 organoids, we next studied whether already-developed, mature organoids were also 249 affected by nylon microplastics
 We therefore exposed organoids to nylon reference 250 microfibers during organoid formation as before (14-day incubation) and we additionally 251 exposed fully developed 14-day organoids to microfibers on top of the Matrigel or to nylon 252 leachate for an additional 7 days
 Interestingly, in contrast to the strong effects observed 253 on developing organoids, we found that the compounds leaching from nylon had no 254 effects on already-developed organoids (Figure 7A), as reflected by unchanged numbers of 255 organoids (Figure 7B and C) and unchanged sizes (Figure 7D and E)
 This suggests that 256 these nylon leachates are mostly harmful to differentiation of epithelial progenitors, but 257 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 The condition of 2000 fibers was added because 275 the effect of 5000 fibers on airway epithelial development was already profound and we 276 wanted to investigate more subtle changes
 However, both conditions had an enormous 277 impact on epithelial gene expression as depicted by the volcano plots (Figure A-D)
 278 Exposure to 2000 nylon fibers (equivalent to 16 g/ml nylon) resulted in 16455 transcripts 279 being differentially expressed at least two-fold compared to nonexposed controls, with an 280 q value <
05 (p value corrected for the false discovery rate), with most being 281 downregulated (Figure 8A and C)
 Exposure to 5000 nylon fibers (equivalent to 39 g/ml 282 nylon) resulted in 39395 transcripts being differentially expressed at least two-fold 283 compared to nonexposed controls, with most being upregulated (Figure 8B and D)
  284 To reduce the number of transcripts, we then selected only those transcripts that had an 285 average basemean expression of at least 10 and were significantly (q value <
05) up or 286 downregulated in both exposure conditions of 2000 and 5000 nylon fibers compared to 287 nonexposed controls
 This resulted in 10764 transcripts that were differentially expressed 288 compared to nonexposed controls, with 5522 being downregulated and 5242 being 289 upregulated
 The downregulated transcripts were then sorted on the lowest q value for 290 exposure to 2000 fibers and the upregulated transcripts were sorted on the lowest q value 291 for exposure to 5000 fibers and the top 500 genes of each were used for pathway analysis 292 The top pathways identified for downregulated genes following nylon exposure were 294 highly enriched for epithelial development and function (figure 8E-F), while the top 295 pathways identified for upregulated genes were highly enriched for mRNA translation and 296 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 2k: 2000 fibers; 5k: 5000 319 We then investigated expression of individual genes in the top 5 enriched pathways for up 322 and downregulated genes in more detail (Figures E-H)
 The top 5 enriched pathways for 323 downregulated genes were type I hemidesmosome assembly, formation of cornified 324 envelope, cell-cell adhesion, epithelial cell differentiation, and epithelial cell proliferation, 325 while the top 5 pathways for upregulated genes were SRP-dependent cotranslational 326 protein targeting to membrane, neutrophil degranulation, regulation of protein complex 327 assembly, negative regulation of protein complex assembly, and negative regulation of 328 We first investigated the downregulated genes and many of them represent important 330 epithelial populations in the lung
 We therefore investigated genes associated with specific 331 epithelial populations (listed in table )
 The expression of these genes correlated well with 332 our organoid findings that airway epithelial cell growth was most affected by exposure to 333 nylon fibers, while alveolar epithelial cell growth was less affected (Figure )
 Both AECI 334 and AEC II genes (Figure 9A) were only marginally lower expressed after exposure to nylon 335 while most genes for basal cells (Figure 9B), ciliated cells (Figure 9C), club cells and goblet 336 cells (Figure 9D) were expressed at significantly lower levels compared to controls with 337 two noticeable exceptions: ciliated cell marker Tuba1a and club cell marker Scgb1a1, that 338 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 339 Proliferation markers like proliferation marker protein 67 (Mki67), forkhead box protein 340 M1 (Foxm1), and polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1, Figure 9E) confirmed this general lack of 341 proliferation in epithelial cells as all three were expressed at lower levels in a dose-342 dependent manner after exposure to nylon fibers
 Expression of genes for signaling 343 molecules essential for epithelial growth and development were impressively and dose-344 dependently downregulated by nylon exposure as well (Figure 9F), including Notch1 and 345 Notch2 and their ligands Jagged 1 (Jag1) and 2 (Jag2) (48-50), Bmp4 and Bmp7 (51-53), 346 Wnt4 and Wnt7a (54, 55), and the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, Met
 The lower 347 expression of basal cell-specific markers and essential factors that are needed for 348 differentiation of other cell types like ciliated and goblet cells may explain why the growth 349 of in particular airway organoids was inhibited most by nylon

 None of 359 these genes were negatively affected in fibroblasts after exposure to nylon fibers 360 compared to untreated controls and expression of most actually went up slightly (Figure 361 The genes most prominently upregulated after exposure to nylon fibers were mostly 363 encoding for ribosomal proteins, with ribosomal protein L28 (Rpl28), L31 (Rpl31), and L38 364 (Rpl38) being most profoundly upregulated (Figure G)
 Ribosomal proteins are a large 365 family of proteins and essential parts of ribosomes translating mRNA to protein
 Recent 366 data has shown that heterogeneity in ribosomal protein composition within ribosomes 367 makes them selective for translating subpools of transcripts ()
 For instance, Rpl38 has 368 been shown to regulate translation of the homeobox (Hox) genes, that are key in 369 anatomical development ()
 We therefore also investigated the expression of all Hox 370 genes and some specific members of this family involved in lung epithelial development in 371 more detail (Figure 9H) (58, )
 After exposure to nylon fibers, expression of Hox family 372 members was significantly higher and this pattern was seen for highlighted members 373 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

05 (n=4 independent isolations)
 The following genes in the 380 following conditions were not significantly different: 2k nylon: Hopx, Ager, Sftpc, Sftpb, 381 Stk11, Scgb1a1, Bmp4, Notch2, Hoxa4; 5k nylon: Hopx, Ager, Plk

 (G) Genes encoding 386 Recent reports have shown that man-made fibers are ubiquitously present in indoor air (9, 391 -)
 It is estimated that approximately 30% of those indoor fibers are of plastic origin, 392 particularly from textiles (9, -)
 The lungs are continuously exposed to this airborne 393 microplastic pollution (60), but the consequences of common household exposure on our 394 lungs are unclear
 In our present work, we found that both polyester and nylon microfibers 395 negatively affected the growth and development of human and murine lung organoids, 396 with nylon being the most harmful
 Already established lung organoids were not affected 397 and therefore our results may be of particular importance for young children with 398 developing airways and for people undergoing high levels of epithelial repair, such as 399 Nylon was found to be the most consistently harmful for growth of airway organoids and 402 was less inhibitory for growth of alveolar organoids, while polyester affected both types 403 equally but less profoundly than nylon
 This was the case for our reference fibers as well as 404 environmentally relevant fibers made from fabrics purchased in a local fabric store
 The 405 gene expression analysis also confirmed that growth of alveolar organoids was affected 406 less by nylon exposure and even appeared induced after treatment with leachate or lower 407 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 The explanation for this finding may be found in the 408 downregulation of Notch signaling pathway members by nylon fibers
 Multiple studies 409 have shown that Notch signaling is required for development of airway epithelial cells, 410 most specifically goblet cells, whereas disruption of this signaling boosts alveolar epithelial 411 development (61, )
 Both Notch1 and Notch2, as well as their ligands Jag1 and Jag2 412 were expressed at significantly lower levels after nylon treatment, suggesting disruption of 413 Notch signaling may be responsible for the divergent effect nylon has on airway versus 414 The Notch pathway, incidentally, is also important for the development of club cells ()
 416 Morimoto and colleagues showed that Notch2 was involved in the decision between club 417 cell or ciliated cell development
 Interestingly, the gene expression data for club cells and 418 ciliated cells were somewhat ambiguous, with important markers for these cell types 419 having higher expression (Scgb1a1 for club cells and Tub1a1 for ciliated cells) and others 420 having lower expression (Bpifa1 for club cells and Foxj1 and Stk11 for ciliated cells) after 421 nylon exposure
 This may suggest that the lower expression of Notch2 may be hampering 422 the cell fate decision between club and ciliated cells in some way, resulting in improperly 423 differentiated cell types
 In combination with the inhibited development of basal epithelial 424 cells and goblet cells, this altered airway epithelial differentiation may explain the 425 bronchiolitis found in nylon flock workers and rats exposed to nylon (-)
  426 Our results demonstrated that the negative effect of nylon fibers on development of 428 particularly airway organoids was caused by components leaching from these fibers
 As 429 the most abundant components in this leachate, the cyclic oligomers, were not 430 responsible for this effect, we used RNAseq analysis to look for signatures of other 431 components
 Although we could not detect bisphenol A in our leachate, it is of interest to 432 note that exposure of fruit flies to bisphenol A specifically upregulated ribosome-433 associated genes (67), similar to what we found in our study
 The association of these Rpl 434 genes with the Hox family genes is of particular interest for lung epithelial development
 435 Rpl38 was one of the three most upregulated Rpl genes by nylon and was shown to 436 interact with a specific subset of Hox genes including Hoxa4, Hoxa5, and Hoxb3 ()
 These 437 have all been associated with epithelial differentiation, with Hoxa5 taking a center stage in 438 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Boucherat and colleagues showed that loss 439 of Hoxa5 drove epithelial differentiation towards goblet cell differentiation at the expense 440 of club cell differentiation and Scgb1a1 expression ()
 Remarkably, Hoxa5 was expressed 441 at significantly higher levels in our dataset in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to 442 nylon and we also found a matching dose-dependent increase in Scgb1a1 and decrease in 443 Muc5ac and Muc5b expression
 Taken together our data suggest that component (s) in 444 nylon leachate may be skewing differentiation of epithelial progenitors away from airway 445 epithelial cells possibly through changes in expression of Hoxa5 and/or Notch
 Which 446 components or combinations of components are responsible for these effects is still an 447 A strength of using lung organoids is the opportunity to directly translate murine findings 450 to human lung epithelial repair (32, 33, 43, 68, )
 Using cells isolated from human lungs 451 we have shown human epithelial cells respond similarly to polyester and nylon fibers, 452 demonstrating our results are relevant for human epithelial differentiation and growth 453 too
 Despite this advantage, lung organoids are a relatively simple model of lung tissue and 454 lack the immune and endothelial compartment present in vivo
 Especially having the 455 immune compartment present could alter how lung tissue responds to these microplastic 456 fibers
 For example, innate immune cells like macrophages are also one of the first cells to 457 come into contact with microplastic fibers following inhalation and macrophages are 458 known to respond strongly to inhaled particles and fibers (70) and are also important for 459 lung repair ()
 It is therefore recommended to include lung macrophages in lung 460 organoid cultures in future studies as was done before by Choi et al ()
 This way, a more 461 comprehensive view on the interaction between pivotal lung cells and microplastics can be 462 The implication of our results for the human population is of high relevance
 It is important 465 to note that similar to the high occupational exposure in industry workers, the microplastic 466 fiber doses as used in our in vitro experiments are much higher than daily exposure for 467 most people
 Previous studies estimated that a male person with light activity may inhale 468 around 272 microplastic particles per day based on air sampling using a breathing thermal 469 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 The total surface of airway epithelial cells is 2471 cm2 for human lungs (73), 470 resulting in 
1 particle/cm
 Our murine cultures had an average of 70 airway organoids 471 with an average size of 320 m, resulting in a total surface of 
2 cm2 that was incubated 472 with 5000 fibers or 25,000 fibers/cm
 For our calculations we assumed these 473 particles/fibers will get trapped onto airway epithelial cells
 Generally particles or fibers of 474 sizes between 10 and 100 m will deposit onto epithelial cells covering airway walls ()
 475 Only fibers with a diameter smaller than 3 m have the ability to penetrate deep into the 476 lungs and reach the alveoli
 Our fiber sizes were limited by the availability of polyester and 477 nylon filaments of standardized small diameters and therefore were not small enough for 478 alveolar deposition
 However, airway trapping can still cause local harm as we found nylon 479 fibers to inhibit airway epithelial differentiation most
 It will therefore be crucial to study 480 in more detail how many and what kind of fibers deposit in which regions of the lungs and 481 what fraction can still be cleared
 In addition, we need to gather more information about 482 exposure levels in indoor environments to assess real-life inhalation levels
 A limitation 483 here is the detection of microplastics, as smaller particles might escape current detection 484 methods (10, )
 Especially our finding that epithelial differentiation and repair 485 mechanisms are affected most by microplastics exposure, suggests airborne microplastics 486 may be most harmful to young children with developing airways and to people undergoing 487 high levels of epithelial repair
 These could be people with a chronic lung disease or even 488 In conclusion, with the ongoing and growing use of plastics, potential associated health 491 problems in the human population may also increase
 The results of the present study 492 strongly encourage to look in more detail at both hazard of and exposure to microplastic 493 fibers, and outcomes of these experiments will be valuable to advise organizations such as 494 the World Health Organization and Science Advice for Policy by European Academies who 495 have recently stated that more research is urgently needed (30, )
 Importantly, future 496 research should focus on examining the presence and number of such fibers both in our 497 indoor environment and in human lung tissue, to better estimate the actual risk of these 498 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Paired-end sequencing was performed using a NextSeq 500 machine 682 (Illumina; mate 1 up to 74 cycles and mate 2 up to 9 cycles)
 Mate 1 contained the first STL 683 (stochastic labeling) barcode, followed by the first bases of the sequenced fragments, and 684 mate 2 only contained the second STL barcode
 The generated data were subsequently 685 demultiplexed using sample-specific barcodes and changed into fastq files using bcl2fastq 686 (Illumina; version

 Sequenced poly A tails 690 were removed as well, by using a poly T sequence as adapter sequence (T (100); reverse 691 complement after sequencing)
 Reads shorter than 36 bases were discarded

0; settings: k=1000, --norc)
 The number of reported alignments, 694 k, was given a high number in order to not miss any alignment results (some genes have up 695 to 62 transcripts)
 Reads were only mapped to the forward strand (directional sequencing)
 696 Fragment sequences that mapped to multiple genes were removed (unknown origin)
 697 When fragments mapped to multiple transcripts from the same gene all but one were 698 given a non-primary alignment flag by HISAT2 (flag )
 These flags were removed 699 (subtraction of 256) by the same Perl script in order to be able to use the Bash-based shell 700 script (dqRNASeq; see below) that is provided by Bioo Scientific (Perkin Elmer, MA, USA)
 701 Fragments that mapped to multiple transcripts from the same gene were considered 702 unique and were counted for each of the transcripts
 The number of unique fragments (or 703 read pairs) was determined for each transcript using the script provided by Bioo Scientific 704 (dqRNASeq; settings: s=8, q=0, m=)
 Counts that were used for further analysis were 705 based on a unique combination of start and stop positions and barcodes (USS + STL)

 Data are 715 presented as median  range and p-values <005 were considered significant
 716 For RNA sequencing data, the principal component analyses were performed in R using the 718 R package DESeq2 (version 
 
0) (77) in order to visualize the overall effect of 719 experimental covariates as well as batch effects (function: plotPCA)
 Differential gene 720 expression analyses (treated vs
 nontreated) was performed with the same R package 721 (default settings; Negative Binomial GLM fitting and Wald statistics; design=~condition), 722 (nylon-treated versus nontreated fibroblasts or epithelial cells) and a false discovery rate 724 smaller than 
05 (q value) were considered differentially expressed in that specific cell 725 type
 Volcano plots and clustering heat maps were made using BioJupies ()

 Excessive microfibers were 1003 removed using pressurized air, after which the samples were sputter coated with 10 nm 1004 of carbon
 The EDX measurements were performed with a Tescan MAIA III GMH field 1005 emission scanning electron microscope (Czech Republic) equipped with a Bruker X-Flash 1006 30 mm2 silicon drift energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis detector (MA, USA)
  1007 using a Thermo Nicolet iN10 micro Fourier transform infrared microscope
 Spectra were 1011 recorded in the wavelength range from 4000 to 675 cm-1 using a spectral resolution of 8 1012 cm-
 For the transmission measurements of the polyester reference material and the 1013 polyester and nylon environmental fibers, a small amount of the microfibers was 1014 transferred onto a diamond micro compression cell where the samples were 1015 compressed
 For the reflection measurements of the nylon reference material and the 1016 polyester and nylon environmental fibers, a small portion of microfibers was suspended 1017 in water
 The suspension was subsequently filtered over a gold coated 
8 m 1018 polycarbonate filter (TJ Environmental, The Netherlands)
 A subset of approximately 100 1019 fibers was individually measured directly on the filter using the reflection mode of the -1020 A round bottom flask containing 
1 g cryogenically milled nylon powder (PA66, Sigma-1024 Aldrich) and 500 ml methanol (VWR) was equipped with a reflux condenser and the 1025 suspension was stirred overnight at C
 Next, the suspension was cooled to 1026 approximately 30C and filtered over a cellulose filter (VWR) to remove the remaining 1027 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 A white solid was obtained (yield 220 mg), of which the composition 1029 A column for silica gel chromatography ( 30 mm, VWR) was charged with silica gel 60 1032 (27 g, 
 -
200 mm, Merck) and dichloromethane (DCM, VWR) as eluent
 The crude 1033 extract containing the mixture of oligomers (200 mg) was added on top of the silica gel 1034 column and oligomers were separated on the column using DCM:methanol as eluent 1035 (DCM:MeOH gradient: 100:0  90:10  80:20), which resulted in complete separation 1036 of the oligomers
 The collected fractions were checked for the presence of product using 1037 LC/MS
 The fractions containing pure oligomer were combined, filtered over a glass filter 1038 (VWR) and subsequently the solvent was removed in vacuo
 The obtained solids were 1039 further dried in vacuo, after which the pure oligomers were obtained as white solids
