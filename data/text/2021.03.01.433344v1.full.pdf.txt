 ;    Background: Herbal medicinal products have a long-standing history of use in the therapy of 26 common respiratory infections
 In the COVID-19 pandemic, they may have the potential  for 27 symptom relief in non-severe or moderate disease cases
  Here we describe the results derived by 28 in	vitro screening of five herbal medicinal products with regard to their potential to i) interfere 29 with the binding of the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with the SARS-30 CoV-2 Spike S1 protein, ii) modulate the release of the human defensin HBD1 and cathelicidin LL-31 37 from human A549 lung cells upon Spike S1 protein stimulation and iii) modulate the release of 32 IFN- from activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
	 The investigated 33 extracts were:	 Sinupret extract (SINx), Bronchipret thyme-ivy (BRO TE), Bronchipret thyme-34 Methods:	The inhibitory effect of the herbal medicinal products on the binding interaction of 36 Spike S1 protein and the human ACE2 receptor was measured by ELISA
 The effects on 37 intracellular IFN- expression in stimulated human PBMCs were measured by flow cytometry
 38 Regulation on HBD1 and LL-37 expression and secretion was assessed in 25d long-term cultured 39 human lung A549 epithelial cells by RT-PCR and ELISA
  40 Results: IMU and BRO TE concentration-dependently inhibited the interaction between spike 41 protein and the ACE2 Receptor
 However, this effect was only observed in the cell-free assay at a 42 concentration range which was later on determined as cytotoxic to human PBMC
  SINx, TOP and 43 BRO TP significantly upregulated the intracellular expression of antiviral IFN from stimulated 44 PBMC
 Co-treatment of A549 cells with IMU or BRO TP together with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 45 significantly upregulated mRNA expression (IMU) and release (IMU and BRO TP) of HBD1 and LL-46 Conclusions:	 The in	 vitro screening results provide first evidence for an immune activating 48 potential of some of the tested herbal medicinal extracts in the context of SARS-CoV-

 ;    All over the world the population is struggling with the outbreak of COVID-
 Effective 53 antiviral therapies are unavailable so far, comprehensive vaccination has yet to be achieved and 54 various mutants of the enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus SARS-CoV2 have emerged (Greaney 55 et al, )
 Thus it is of critical importance to search for compounds, which could help in fighting 56 the virus pandemic
 Testing the effectiveness of different drug types used previously in the 57 treatment of other diseases is here one strategy to accelerate the development
 Herbal medicinal 58 products have the potential to interfere with various steps of the viral replication cycle  (Brendler 59 and Al-Harrasi, 2020; Mani et al, )
 Besides, they have been reported to exhibit an anti-60 inflammatory and immune modulating potential and thus may also be supportive in prevention 61 or attenuation of mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infections (Glatthaar-Saalmller B, 2011; Seibel 62 et al, 2015; Seibel et al, )
 In this pilot screening study, five herbal medicinal products, 63 marketed for the treatment against respiratory infections (Bachert, 2020; Rossi et al, 2012; Seibel 64 et al, 2015; Seibel et al, 2018), were explored for their potential to i) interfere with the binding 65 of the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with the SARS-CoV-2 spike 66 protein
 The ACE2 receptor found in various organs including type I and II pneumocytes, 67 endothelial cells, oral and nasal mucosa but also intestinal tissues, liver, kidney, or brain 68 (Hamming et al, 2004; Xu et al, 2020) has been identified as the key cellular receptor, which 69 facilitates uptake of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the host cell (Ortiz et al, )
 Drugs targeting the 70 interaction between the spike protein receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor 71 may thus offer some protection against this novel viral infection (Hu et al, 2020) (Yang et al, 72 )
 ii) We investigated whether the extracts can modulate the release of the defensin HBD1 73 and cathelicidin LL-37 from human A549 lung cells upon SARS-CoV-2 spike protein stimulation
 74 In the innate immune system, these antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), have a non-enzymatic 75 inhibitory effect on a broad spectrum of microorganisms (Wilson et al, )
 Human beta 76 defensins (HBDs) have known antiviral effects on both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses 77 (Ding et al, )
 Due to the relative nonspecificity of the targets of defensins compared to those 78 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    of the adaptive arm, antiviral applications of defensins are conceptually ideal for protection 79 against different viral infections (Holly et al, 2017; Wilson et al, )
 iii) We investigated 80 whether the plant extracts could modulate the activated immune system in terms of regulating 81 anti-viral interferon gamma (IFN-) production
 This type II interferon is produced by T 82 lymphocytes and NK cells and essential for antiviral defense
 It suppresses virus replication and 83 activates T cell cytokine production (Levy and Garca-Sastre, )
  84 All plant extract mixtures were provided by Bionorica SE either in dried or fluid form
 The dried 88 extracts were used in different dilutions

 The study was approved 135 by the Ethics Committee of the University of Freiburg and carried out according to their guidelines 136 and regulations (ethical vote /)
 PBMC isolation was done by centrifugation on a 137 cells were then washed twice with PBS and viability and concentration was determined using the 139 The capacity of extracts to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2-Spike-ACE2 binding was tested using the SARS-143 CoV-2 (COVID-19) Inhibitor screening kit (BioCat GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the 144 manufacturers instructions

 161 PBMC were treated with extracts for 6h and co-stimulated with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 164 13-acetate (PMA), 1 g/ml ionomycin, and a SARS-CoV-2 S peptide pool (Miltenyi Biotec, 165 Germany) for immune reaction together with 10 g/ml brefeldin A

 ;    The inhibitory potential of the extracts between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the ACE2 186 receptor was tested in a cell free assay
  A concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on spike 187 binding to ACE2 was seen with extract IMU (maximum of 86%  
3), extract BRO TP (maximum 188 of 44%  
8) and extract BRO TE (maximum of 77%  
 )
 For extracts TOP, no relevant effect 189 (data not shown) and for SINx minor effects were observed (figure )
 190 First, cytotoxicity of the extracts was quantified after 24 h exposure in human PBMC
 Relevant 193 toxicity (i
 e
 >10%) was evident for extract IMU at  1:40 dilution, for extract BRO-TP at  
25 194 mg/ml and for BRO-TE at  1:200 dilution
 For TOP and SINx, no relevant toxicity could be seen 195 in the applied in	vitro model
 Upon stimulation with a mixture of SARS-CoV-2 S peptide pool, PMA 196 and ionomycin, a significant increase in intracellular IFN- expression (in range of 7-15%) could 197 be seen (see figure )
 Compared to control cells, a significant increase in IFN- expression could 198 be seen in stimulated PBMC with extract TOP (145%  27 at a 1:60 dilution), extract SINx (169% 199  26 at 
25 mg/ml) and extract BRO TE (157%  31 at a 1:1000 dilution) (figure )
 For extract 200 IMU and BRO TP, no additional increase in IFN- expression was seen
 In contrast, at  
167 201 mg/ml, extract BRO TP had an inhibitory effect on INF-, which is likely due to beginning 202 For first insights into the effects of the test items on cellular defense mechanisms we analysed the 206 mRNA expression and secretion of HBD-1 and LL-37 in human A549 cells
 Based on the findings 207 in human PBMC, the absence of relevant cytotoxicity (i
 e
 > 10%) upon extract exposure was first 208 confirmed in 25d long-term cultured A549 cells using the LDH-Glo cytotoxicity assay (data not 209 shown)
 We then treated the cells with Sars-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein together with the extracts for 210 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    24 h
 Thereafter, a significant increase in HBD1 mRNA expression was measured for IMU (154% 211  33 at 1:100 dilution) and extract SINx (144%  27 at 
67mg/ml) as compared to control (figure 212 )
 A similar trend was observed in LL-37 regulation upon co-treatment with IMU (184%68 at 213 1:60 dilution), BRO-TP (161%  17 at 
167 mg/ml) or BRO-TE (130%  2 at 1:400 dilution) 214 together with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
  Additionally, the extract-induced secretion of HBD1 215 and LL37 was analysed by ELISA in presence and absence of the spike protein at different time 216 points (figure )
 Both extracts, IMU and BRO TP, could significantly trigger also the secretion of 217 HBD1 peptide with or without S1 spike protein co-treatment from A549 cells
 Extract BRO TP 218 could also significantly trigger the secretion of LL-37 either with S1 spike protein co-treatment or 219 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    Herbal extracts are known to induce diverse cellular defense mechanisms following viral infection 224 of human cells (Khare et al, 2020; Kim et al, )
 Using different screening assays, we show 225 here that extracts of marketed herbal medicinal products elicit potential beneficial effects in	vitro	226 in terms of cellular defense activation upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or peptide 227 The first step of viral infection is the interaction of the virus with the host cell
 In case of SARS229 CoV-2 the spike protein interacts with the ACE2 receptor on the surface of epithelial cells such as 230 from in the oral cavity or respiratory tract (Mani et al, 2020; Tay, 2020; Xu et al, )
 In our 231 study, extracts from IMU and BRO TE were able to interfere with the binding between the S1 spike 232 protein and the human ACE2 receptor
 Computational binding studies show that common herbal 233 secondary metabolites like luteolin or quercetin could be able to bind and block the ACE2 receptor 234 (Khare et al, 2020; Mani et al, 2020; Muchtaridi et al, 2020), and also bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike 235 protein
 A demonstration of interference with SARS-CoV-2 spike ACE2 binding using cell-free or 236 in	vitro assays is missing for most of them, though
 So, for quercetin and its metabolites, inhibition 237 of recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) activity has been reported in	vitro (Liu et al, )
 The 238 rhACE2 activity was then inhibited by rutin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, tamarixetin, and 3,4-239 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid by %
 With an IC50 of 
48 M, quercetin was the most potent 240 rhACE2 inhibitor tested in this study
 The herbal extracts investigated here contain high amounts 241 of these plant metabolites (Assessment report on Quercus robur L
; EMA, 2013; 242 EMA/HMPC/136583/2012 Assessment report on Primula veris L
 and/or Primula elatior (L
) Hill, 243 2012; EMA/HMPC/342334/2013 Assessment report on Thymus vulgaris L
 and L
, 2012; Seibel 244 et al, 2015; Seibel et al, )
 Thus, these constituents could account or add to the inhibitory 245 effect observed by the two herbal extract mixtures IMU and BRO TE and it will be important to 246 further ascertain this hypothesis in ongoing studies
 The products are mixtures made from several 247 medicinal plants, thus it might also be helpful to determine the plant with the largest share on this 248 effect
 This is the more important as the inhibition was observed at a concentration range which 249 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    turned out to be cytotoxic to human PBMC and which is not relevant for the direct use in practice
 250 But, IMU and BRO TP also activated the human innate immune defense by increasing the level of 251 defensin HBD1 and/or cathelicidin LL37 upon SARS-CoV-2 spike protein stimulation and this was 252 evident at much lower concentrations
 By regulating chemokine and cytokine production, both 253 AMPs help to maintain homeostasis of the immune system and display antiviral properties, as for 254 example evidenced by gene regulation upon viral challenge or expression in cells involved in viral 255 defense (Wilson et al, )
 LL-37, consisting of 37 amino acids and an overall positive net 256 charge (+6) can also eliminate microbes directly by electrostatic binding to negatively charged 257 molecules on microbial membranes (PrePrint Roth et al, )
 In secretions from lung and nose 258 it was found that LL-37 could reach high concentrations indicating to a relevant role in lung 259 immune defense mechanisms (Kim et al, 2003; Mansbach et al, 2017; Schaller-Bals et al, )
 260 Defensins can be detected in the mucosa of all respiratory tissues, including pharynx (22, )
 The 261 effect of AMPs on virus infections appear to be specific to the virus, AMP, and also target cell and 262 to our knowledge, a direct antiviral efficacy of HBD-1 or LL-37 against SARS-CoV-2 has not been 263 shown so far (Ding et al, )
 However, interestingly, for LL-37 a binding to the SARS-CoV-2 264 spike protein and an inhibitory action of LL-37 on the spike protein to its entry receptor have been 265 reported using binding competition studies (PrePrint Roth et al, )
 In another study, high 266 structural similarity of LL-37 to the N-terminal helix of the receptor-binding domain of SARS-267 CoV-2 was reported (PrePrint Kiran Bharat Lokhande, )
 There is also currently 268 speculation that vitamin D, by upregulation of LL-37, could be beneficial on the course of COVID-269 19 disease (Crane-Godreau et al, 2020) and LL-37 even has been proposed by some researchers 270 for treatment of COVD-19 patients (PrePrint Zhang et al, )
 Thus, stimulating LL37 271 expression, as observed here in	vitro with BRO TP, might have several advantages during early 272 phase of SARS-CoV-2 entry, but this hypothesis, again, needs further verification
  273 BRO TE and SINx extracts could be shown in the present study to further boost the immune 274 response of PBMC in terms of intracellular IFN- expression, which was activated by a mixture 275 including SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides
 Once a virus has entered the cell and is replicated, a host 276 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    immune response starts to combat viral infection (Tay, )
 An early interferon response of the 277 host has been reported to be essential for an effective defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Liao 278 et al, 2020; Tay, )
 In turn, a decrease of IFN positive T-helper cells might increase the risk 279 for severe courses of COVID-19 (Pierce et al, 2020; Sattler et al, )
 The here reported in	vitro 280 findings provide a first hint that BRO TE and SINx may help in further IFN expression during 281 infection
 On the one hand, INF- is essential for the antiviral defense, but on the other hand 282 persistant high levels of INF- have been reported to worsen the systemic inflammation, 283 intensifying tissue injury and organ failure (Wang et al, 2020) during COVID-19 disease
 This yet 284 known ambiguous role of IFN- in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection here also asks for special 285 In conclusion, the marketed herbal medicinal products tested in this study demonstrate a range 287 of potential support of the human immune defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection
 Whether the 288 observed effects could be relevant for the systemic use in man or limited to local effects e
 g
 in the 289 oral cavity, needs to be investigated
 Further confirmatory mechanistic studies are necessary to 290 gain a deeper understanding of the reported observations and the transferability of the in	vitro 291 results to the clinical situation needs to be tested
