 Symptoms based on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) were obtained at baseline and after ABM training
  Results: ABM training led to significantly greater decrease in clinician-rated symptoms of depression as compared to the control condition

 ;    A wide range of treatments are available for depression
 However, systematic reviews point to limited efficacy in terms of remission, response rates and long-term effects for both pharmacological (1) and psychological treatments ()
 Forty percent of patients do not, or only partially, respond to treatment, and less than one third are completely recovered after treatment ()
 Residual symptoms following treatment are associated with decreased return to function, reduced quality of life and increased risk of recurrence Depression is associated with an increased focus on negative interpretations of events and negative biases in attention and memory
  Previous studies have reported that clinically depressed subjects orient their attention toward negative faces rather than neutral or positive faces ()
 Biases towards negative faces have also been reported in previously depressed, currently euthymic subjects (6), and in never-depressed individuals with a family history of depression ()
 In a seminal experimental study a causal role for negative attention biases in the expression of depressive and anxious symptoms was demonstrated ()
 They found higher levels of anxiety and depression related mood ratings in undergraduates, as a reaction to a stressor, after being trained to preferentially attend to negative versus neutral stimuli
 Together these results indicate that negative rather than simple markers of lowered mood
 This suggests that interventions designed to reduce AB may act to reduce symptoms in patients treated for depression
 biases towards more positive and less negative stimuli
 ABM is low on resource requirements and easy to disseminate and might therefore be widely used by patients with residual symptoms or while waiting for more resource intensive interventions like psychotherapy
 While some studies have reported an effect of ABM in depression a number of meta-analyses have suggested a small effect size, although definitive conclusions have been limited by small sample sizes and poor trial methodology employed in many studies (-)
 In addition, some potential techniques for altering AB have failed to modify AB as part of the treatment programme, which limits their ability to The main objective of our study was to test the early efficacy of ABM in a large group of previously depressed patients, but with residual symptoms using a preregistered trial design
 We hypothesized that two weeks of ABM training would reduce clinician- and self-reported residual symptoms of depression, as compared to a matched control condition
 Given the clear mechanistic role for altered bias in the clinical effects of ABM, we predicted a change towards more positive biases in the ABM group and that this certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Participants completed two sessions of ABM daily using laptops provided by the research team
 A detailed calendar was used to specify the scheduling of the training sessions for each participant
 Symptoms of depression and AB were assessed at baseline and immediately The main recruitment base was an outpatient clinic in the Department of Psychiatry, Diakonhjemmet Hospital in Oslo
 Participants were also recruited from other clinical sites, by local advertisements, and via social media
 Candidates were pre-screened by phone for exclusion criteria before in person formal clinical evaluation and enrollment
 spectrum disorders, substance use disorders, attention deficit disorder, and head trauma A total of 377 participants between 18-65 years old were recruited for clinical evaluation
  Participants had experienced more than one previous episode of depression as defined using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, version 
 
 
 (MINI)
 A total of 56 subjects were excluded following the clinical evaluation
 The period of recruitment and follow-up was January 2015 to October 2016 and was first posted in A total of 321 participants with a history of Major Depressive Episodes (MDE) were randomised to receive ABM or placebo
 Thirty-seven participants who fulfilled the MINI criteria for current MDE were enrolled onto the study in error (current MDE was described as exclusion criteria in the pre-registered protocol)
 Inclusion of data from The ABM task was a computerized visual dot-probe procedure adopted from ()
 Paired images of faces (the stimuli), were presented followed by one or two dots (a probe), which appeared behind one of the stimuli
 Participants were required to press one of two buttons as quickly as possible to indicate the number of dots in the probe
 The types of stimuli used during the ABM task were pictures of emotional faces of three valences; positive (happy), neutral, or negative (angry and fearful)
 A single session of the task involved 96 trials with equal numbers of the three stimulus pair types
 In addition, there were equal numbers of trials in which the stimuli were randomly presented for 500- or 1000 ms before the probe was displayed
 In each trial of the task, stimuli from two valences were displayed, in one of the following pairing types: positive-neutral, positive-negative, and negative-neutral In the ABM condition, probes were located behind positive (valid trials) stimuli in 87 % of the trials, as opposed to 13% with probes located behind the more negative stimuli (invalid trials)

 The neutral ABM control (placebo) condition was identical in every respect, other than the location of the probe, which was located behind the positive (valid trials) stimuli in only 50% of the trials
 Participants completed two sessions of ABM daily during the course of fourteen days (28 sessions in total) on identical notebook computers that were set up and used exclusively for ABM-AB was measured at baseline and after two weeks of ABM using a standard visual probe procedure consisting of 96 trials, with the same trial types as used in the ABM procedure
 Novel facial stimuli were used in the assessment tasks
 AB was calculated as the difference in reaction between trials in which the probe replaced the relatively more negative face vs
 the more positive face ([(SUM(positive up- probe down, positive down, probe up) - SUM(positive up- probe up, positive down- probe down)]/
 )
 Thus a more positive score reflects a greater bias towards the more positive stimuli

 Outcome assessors and participants were therefore blind to allocation The primary outcome measures were The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) (15) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) (16) administered to assess both clinician - and self evaluations of symptoms
 Secondary outcome was AB measured by a single session of the placebo-training task at baseline and after two weeks follow-up
 Comorbid anxiety symptomatology was screened by the use of The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI-All data were analysed using PASW

 Symptom at baseline and at two weeks follow-up (HRSD or BDI-II) was entered as within subject variable (time)
 To test the interaction between changes in symptoms and changes in AB, statistically significant symptom changes between ABM and placebo were followed up by repeated measures ANOVA by adding AB (two weeks follow-up minus baseline across valences and stimulus durations) as a second time factor in the model

 A larger intervention independent effect was also found for self-reported depression and self-reported anxiety
 Symptom improvement was dot driven by, but was more pronounced in participants who also fulfilled the formal diagnostic criteria for current depression
 Post hoc exclusion of participants with high HRSD scores had no impact on the ABM effect, and per protocol analyses showed that the results are robust against imputations and compliance rates
  In addition to being among the strongest predictors for recurrence in depressive disorder (4) residual symptoms also cause significant functional impairments, manifested in a variety of domains, including work and leisure activities ()
 The latter is important because one aim of depression treatment is to restore the patients previous level of functioning
 However, residual symptoms in depression have traditionally not been the target of treatment trials
  Given the recurrent nature of the illness, we suggest that this should change and that our study provides an example of how this may be done
   It is not clear why ABM versus placebo did not differ as measured by the BDI-II self-report scale, but instead showed a relatively large improvement in both the ABM- and placebo
 In another recent study, fifty-two participants in a major depressive episode (MDE) was recruited for ABM training and a similar significant change in BDI-II in both the ABM- and placebo was found ()
 The lack of association between ABM and self-reported symptoms was not expected from the pre-registered hypothesis and interpreting the source of this lack of evidence is speculative
 However, self-report may be more influenced by placebo or expectation effects
 A general effect of the intervention may also be linked to cognitive training effects present in both training conditions
 An assessment only group will help in distinguishing placebo- from ABM in future studies
 clinician-rated symptoms represent strength in the current study and the results clearly Participants completed the training in their homes, which is an advantage as it makes it more feasible as a treatment
 Furthermore, compliance was high (see supplemental results) which is important and contrary to the conclusion in a recent review of meta-analyses ()
 These authors conclude that ABM paradigms are most effective when delivered in the laboratory rather than at home
 Specifying the scheduling of the training sessions individually might have increased motivation to do and focus on the task
 The results suggest that ABM does indeed exert an effect on blinded clinician-rated symptoms
 The finding would be considered clinically non significant in treatment trials
 However, it is not clear how to interpret clinical relevance of small HRSD score changes in this group
 The HRSD and BDI-II is only moderately correlated and may partly reflect different depression constructs ()
 It is unclear whether the effect of ABM would continued for longer

  There is a pressing need to improve treatment and thus clinical trials should focus not only on efficacy, but also on identification of the underlying mechanisms through which treatments operate ()
 We observed a number of people with large changes in AB that go along with symptoms improvement, but also with no change in HRSD or even worsening of HRSD scores
 Identification of this individual variability may be useful in evaluations of treatment efficacy and in personalized treatment
 The current study reports the pre-registered primary outcome, but stratification based on degree of AB, changes in dispersion and/or distribution of AB, or paradigms sensitive to the temporal expression of AB may help advance basic knowledge on the conditional benefit of ABM ()
  The study has several limitations that should be mentioned
 Sparse research on this population impede calculations of sample sizes from prior studies but would further increase the stringency of the study design in accordance with CONSORT guidelines ()
 Inclusion of 37 patients that also fulfilled the formal criteria for current depression depression did not explain the results and increases the generalizability of the reported findings
 Residual depression is widely defined as the study did not assess symptom change during former treatment and classify all symptoms as residual independent of Previous studies have reported a mixture of positive and negative findings (14, 24-26) leading to a degree of scepticism about the impact of ABM on symptoms of depression ()
 Our study is by far the largest randomized controlled clinical trial of ABM in a depressed population and gives a broader and more transparent picture of the true advantage of the intervention in this population
 The results verify the proof of principle by showing that changes in AB is linked to changes in symptoms and suggest that ABM Ethics approval and consent to participate: Written informed consent was obtained before enrollment
