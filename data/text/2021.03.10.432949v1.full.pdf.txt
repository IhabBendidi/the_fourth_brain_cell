 ;    Effective therapeutics are urgently needed to counter infection and improve outcomes for patients suffering from COVID-19 and to combat this pandemic
 Manipulation of epigenetic machinery to influence viral infectivity of host cells is a relatively unexplored area
 The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of epigenetic readers have been reported to modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection
 Herein, we demonstrate apabetalone, the most clinical advanced BET inhibitor, downregulates expression of cell surface receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) in SARS-CoV-2 permissive cells
 Moreover, we show that apabetalone inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro to levels comparable to antiviral agents
 Taken together, our study supports further evaluation of apabetalone to treat COVID-19, either alone or in (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) 1, a pandemic that has caused more than 2 million deaths worldwide, and continues to be a public health emergency 
 Infected patients present with a wide range of clinical manifestations, including cough, fatigue, and temperature dysregulation (fever / chills) 
 Unfortunately, 10-20% of infected patients progress to severe disease requiring hospitalization, and ~5% of patients become critically ill 
 Moreover, ~10-50% patients have long-term health consequences following acute SARS-CoV-2infection that impact cognitive, cardiovascular, and renal function -
 A dysregulated hyperinflammatory immune response, or cytokine storm, causes harmful widespread tissue damage and is strongly associated with rapidly deteriorating outcomes - viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe lung injury, multi-organ failure and ultimately death 1, 
 The high rate of COVID-19 complications and mortality underscore the urgent need for effective therapies, not only to reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and improve outcomes,  but to support ongoing vaccination efforts that SARS-CoV-2 is typically transmitted through the inhalation of aerosols and respiratory droplets 
 Infection is initiated by binding of the viral spike protein to the transmembrane receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells, followed by fusion of the viral coat with the cell membrane 10, 
 ACE2 expressing cells in the respiratory track are the first to be infected 
 In later stages of infection, SARS-CoV-2 spreads systemically into ACE2 abundant cell types outside of the lung (e
 g
, kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tract) -
 Disrupting spike protein - ACE2 interactions has been the target of experimental COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccine development 10, -

 ;    therapeutics are urgently required to limit the severity of symptoms and prevent necessity for medical intervention arising in unvaccinated subjects, those who do not achieve protection from vaccination or in Recent evidence indicates that ACE2 expression is regulated by bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins in multiple cell types 
 BET proteins are epigenetic readers that bridge acetylation-dependent binding sites and transcriptional machinery to regulate gene transcription via their tandem bromodomains (BD) 1 and BD2 
 Inhibitors of BET proteins (BETi) have been reported to downregulate ACE2 expression and limit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro
 However, pan-BETi that target BET bromodomains with equal affinity generate side-effects and toxicity that limit their clinical application 
 In contrast, apabetalone, an orally available BETi that preferentially targets BD2, is in phase 3 trials for cardiovascular indications, and has an established, favorable safety profile 25, 
 Here we examined BETi effects on viral infection in cell culture models to mimic initial sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as cell types contributing to complications arising in late stages of infection
 We show that apabetalone downregulates ACE2 gene expression, protein levels and cellular binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in cell culture models, and strikingly reduces infection with live SARS-CoV-
 DPP4 / CD26, a potential cofactor for SARS-CoV-2 infection 27, 28, is also downregulated by apabetalone, with potential synergistic effects with ACE2 reductions that  block cellular SARS-CoV-2 uptake and infection
 Together, our data show that BET proteins are key pharmacological targets for COVID-19 treatment and further investigation of apabetalone as a therapeutic to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is warranted

 A dose dependent decrease in hACE2 mRNA was observed in apabetalone treated liver cell culture systems including HepG2 and Huh-7 hepatocarcinoma cells (Fig
 1C-D) and PHH derived from 3 donors of different ages and genders (Fig
 1E; PHH donor characteristics in Supplemental Table S)
 BETi with different chemical scaffolds and mechanism of action were included as positive controls: JQ1 is a pan-BETi with equal affinity for BET bromodomains BD1 and BD2 35, while MZ1 is a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) that directs BET proteins for degradation 
 Each BETi, including apabetalone, promoted downregulation of ACE2 gene expression in the cell types tested (Fig
 1), confirming BET proteins play a pivotal role in the regulation of Immunoblots examining total cell lysates showed that 48 h of BETi treatment reduced ACE2 protein in Calu-3 cells by 40-50% (Fig

 As membrane bound ACE2 protein is critical for SARS-CoV-2 entry 10, BETi effects on ACE2 abundance on the cell surface were assessed using flow cytometry (Fig

 ;    CD26 (gene name DPP4) is a potential cofactor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, as its presence on the cell surface facilitates viral attachment 27, 
 In Calu-3 cells, 48 h of apabetalone treatment resulted in dose dependent downregulation in DPP4 mRNA (up to 65%, p<

 Cell surface CD26 was also reduced with 48 h of BETi treatment in Karpas-299 T cells (Fig
 SC)
 JQ1 and MZ1 evoked similar responses, indicating BET proteins regulate DPP4 / CD26 expression in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells and Karpas-299 T cells
  To model viral association with host cells, we measured binding of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain fused with the human IgG1 Fc-epitope (spike-RBD) to Calu-3 or Vero E6 cells
 Apabetalone pre-treatment for 72 h dose dependently attenuated the amount of spike-RBD protein bound to Calu-3 cells by more than 80% (Fig

 The comparator BETi, MZ1 and JQ1, were In Vero E6 cells, 48 h of apabetalone pre-treatment reduced the amount of spike-RBD binding up to 45%, p=

 Together, these results indicate BET inhibitors reduce levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein Lung epithelial Calu-3 cells are known to support infection of SARS-CoV-2 
 Given the substantial reduction in spike-RBD binding, BETi may impede infection by SARS-CoV-
 To test this, Calu-3 cells were pre-treated with BETi for 48 h, washed, then infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 48 h (Fig
 A)
 Remarkably, viral replication was significantly impaired in cells pre-treated for 48 h with 20 M apabetalone and remained 55-75% efficacious at concentrations below 5 M (Fig

 ;    markedly suppressed
 Remdesivir, a ribonucleotide analogue that inhibits viral RNA polymerases 38, also abolished SARS-CoV-2 replication as expected (Fig
 B)
 Prior to binding ACE2, the viral spike protein is primed via proteolytic cleavage by the host cell transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) 
 Camostat mesylate is a serine protease inhibitor that targets TMPRSS2 
 Pre-treatment of Calu-3 cells with 
5 to 50 M camostat mesylate prevented viral infection completely and reinforce how spike protein priming is a required step to initiate infection
 Importantly, compound treatments were not toxic (Fig
 C)
 Together, apabetalone was equally effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection as agents that target viral SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated via SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions with ACE2 in cells along the respiratory tract, and uptake may be facilitated by cofactors like DPP4 / CD26 as it is for other coronaviruses 
 Viral infection leads to cytopathic injury as viral infection spreads to ACE2 expressing cell types outside of the lung -
 In severe disease, excessive, uncontrolled production of inflammatory mediators generates a cytokine storm and potential for multiorgan dysfunction 
 In this study, we report apabetalone, the most clinically advanced BETi with BD2 selectivity, reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture models through downregulation of viral uptake receptors
 Previous studies have demonstrated apabetalone suppresses activation of innate and adaptive immune responses 31, 41-44, and thus apabetalone may reduce both SARS-CoV-2 infection and control hyperinflammatory conditions associated BET proteins contain two tandem bromodomains, BD1 and BD2, that bind acetylated lysine on histone tails and transcription factors

 Apabetalone is a BETi that preferentially targets BD2, which differentiates it from pan-BETi, including JQ1 35, 
 Toxicities have arisen in clinical trials with pan-BETi, necessitating close monitoring of patients and modified treatment schedules 
 Apabetalone is generally well toleratedand in phase 3 clinical development for cardiovascular and renal indications 25, 26, 49, 
Previous reports have indicated ACE2 gene expression is regulated by BET proteins 
 In this study, apabetalone treatment resulted in robust and dose dependent downregulation of ACE2 gene expression in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells (Fig
 1A; >85% maximal reductions in mRNA levels), as well as extrapulmonary cell types derived from the kidney and liver (Fig
 1B-E; >80% maximal reductions in mRNA levels)
 As a result, apabetalone dose dependently lowered cell surface ACE2 abundance on Calu-3 (Fig
 2; up to 84% reductions) and Vero E6 (up to 40%) that corresponded to reductions in ACE2 gene expression
 Lower levels of cell surface ACE2 were in parallel with diminished binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to cells treated with BETi compounds, including BD2 selective apabetalone, pan-BETi JQ1 and a BET degrader MZ1 (Fig
 3), indicating a BET protein dependent mechanisms lead to binding of viral spike protein
 Strikingly, 48 h of apabetalone pre-treatment at 20 M nearly abolished infection of Calu-3 cells and remained efficacious at concentrations below 1 M (Fig
 B)
 Reduction in cell surface ACE2 levels was sustained 48 h after BETi withdraw (Fig
 S2B-C), which likely account for the profound inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection after pre-treatment
 The positive controls we used in the viral replication assay, remdesivir and camostat mesylate, were 100% effective in blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig
 4B), but their clinical utility is unclear
 Remdesivir has been FDA approved for COVID-19 in those who are hospitalized with severe symptoms, despite the World Health Organization reporting the drug had little to no effect on 28 day mortality and did not delay the need for ventilation or shorten patients stay in hospital 
 Camostat mesylate, a protease inhibitor that prevents proteolytic priming of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by TMPRSS2 to enable ACE2 binding, is still under investigation as an intervention for COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials

 Importantly, treatment with BETi was not toxic to Calu-3 cells at the concentrations applied in the current study (Fig

  Taken together, our results show apabetalone reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and suggest benefit of apabetalone in COVID-19 pathology arising in ACE2 expressing cell types
 Direct infection of the heart remains enigmatic; however, a recent report has described apabetalone-mediated downregulation of ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection / propagation in a 2-D human cardiac myocyte model (Mills, R

 ACE2 converts angiotensin II (Ang II), a hormone that increases blood pressure, into angiotensin (1-7), a vasodilator that lowers blood pressure 
 Therefore, downregulation of ACE2 could result in an increase of Ang II and hypertension, however, blood pressure was not altered by apabetalone treatment in clinical trials 26, -
 DPP4 (CD26) is a membrane-anchored protease linked to diabetes and implicated as a cofactor in SARS-CoV-2 uptake

 CD26 is also linked to T cell activation and DPP4i have been shown to suppress T cell proliferation and production of proinflammatory cytokines

  A cytokine storm can evolve, causing ARDS, multi-organ failure,and even death
 Several anti-inflammatory drugs have been evaluated in clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 with limited success 
 However, BETi may be more effective with dual anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties
 In vitro, apabetalone treatment reduced proinflammatory gene expression in vascular endothelial cells 31, 41, 43, monocytes 31, and vascular smooth muscle cells 
 Further, apabetalone monocytes isolated from diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease 
 Apabetalone also reduced vascular inflammation in a mouse model 41 and countered cytokine driven acute phase responses both in cell culture and in mice 
 These preclinical results translated into clinical trials, where apabetalone treatment was associated with reduction in multiple inflammatory markers in patient plasma 31, 
 No increase in infection or infestation rates in apabetalone treated patients occurred, indicating apabetalone does not suppress immune function to levels that impair clearance of viral infections
 Through anti-inflammatory properties, apabetalone may favorably suppress hyperimmune processes leading to ARDS and mortality in COVID-19 infections
 Further, BETi including apabetalone, improved cardiovascular dysfunction induced by inflammatory mediators found prominently in the COVID-19 cytokine storm in a cardiac organoid model (Mills, R
