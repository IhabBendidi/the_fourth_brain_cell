  The from membrane-derived phospholipids, but its role and mechanisms in the pathogenesis of islet inflammation have not been elucidated
  Leveraging a model of T1D-like islet inflammation in zebrafish, we show here that macrophages contribute significantly to the loss of -cells and the subsequent development of hyperglycemia
  Depletion or inhibition of 12-LOX in this model resulted in significantly reduced macrophage infiltration into islets with preservation of -cell mass
  In mice, we deleted the gene encoding 12-LOX (Alox15) in the myeloid lineage in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) model of TD
  Myeloid cell-specific Alox15 knockout NOD mice demonstrated reduced insulitis and T-cell responses, preserved  cell mass, and almost complete protection from the development of TD
  A critical effect of 12-LOX depletion appeared secondary to a defect in myeloid cell migration, a function required for immune surveillance and tissue injury responses
 This effect on migration appeared to be secondary to the loss of the chemokine receptor CXCR
  Transgenic expression of the gene encoding CXCR3 rescued the migrator defect in zebrafish 12-LOX morphants

  The underlying etiologies of -cell failure in each form of diabetes differs
  In the case of T1D, an active dialog between  cells and cells of the immune system results in the cytokine-induced dysfunction of  cells in the early phase of disease, and in the destruction of -cells by autoreactive T-cells in the later phase []
  A pathology that characterizes this dialog is insulitis, a feature in which islets are invaded by cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineage []
  Insulitis and the nature and timing of cells invading the islet have been characterized best in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D [,]
  Insulitis has also been demonstrated in human T1D, albeit at a much lower frequency than that in NOD mice []
  Drug targeting of the immune system has been the foundational approach in clinical studies attempting to prevent or reverse T1D, but these studies have targeted the activation or function of lymphoid cell  An emerging perspective in T1D posits that islet inflammation arising from innate immune responses may initiate the formation of neoepitopes in  cells, thereby signaling a cascade of immune signaling events leading to the development of T cell-mediated autoimmunity []
  Central to this perspective are cells of the myeloid lineage, which include macrophages and dendritic cells
  These cells mediate inflammation and present antigen to the adaptive immune system [8], and have been observed in the early stages of insulitis in mouse models of T1D []
  The presence of resident macrophages and their closely-related antigen-presenting dendritic cells have been demonstrated in early insulitic lesions in NOD mice [9,12], and their functional inhibition via antibody- or clodronate-mediated global sequestration slows or prevents the occurrence of T1D [,]
  However, as a strategy for T1D, the therapeutic depletion of macrophages would be undesirable given the consequences on overall immunity

  Specifically, 12/15-lipoxygenase (referred to henceforth as simply 12-LOX), which is predominantly expressed in macrophages and pancreatic islets in mice [17], catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to the eicosanoids 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12- and -HETE)
  Global deletion of the gene encoding 12-LOX in mice (Alox15) on the NOD background results in near-total protection of both sexes from T1D development, with a striking reduction in insulitis and the early accumulation of macrophages [18]; similarly, delivery of a small molecule inhibitor of 12-LOX (ML351) in NOD mice shortly after the development of insulitis protects against progression of insulitis and glycemic deterioration []
  Whereas these findings provide evidence for the safety and efficacy of targeting 12-LOX in the context of T1D, they leave unclarified the specific cell of action and molecular mechanisms of -LOX
  In this study, we leveraged genetic models in zebrafish and mice to investigate the role of 12-LOX in the myeloid cell pathogenesis of TD

  Developing zebrafish (3-4 days post-fertilization, dpf) exhibit a discrete pancreatic islet with functional -cells [20], and intact innate immunity with mpeg-expressing macrophages []
  We utilized a model of chemically-induced -cell oxidative injury that we described previously [22], in which zebrafish harboring -cell-specific expression of the gene encoding bacterial nitroreductase (NTR) are treated with the labeled macrophages (Tg(mpeg:eGFP)) to generate a double-transgenic fish line that allows for chemical -cell injury and simultaneous visualization of macrophages in real-time
  Upon treatment of double-transgenic 3 dpf zebrafish with 
5 mM MTZ (Fig
 1A), we observed rapid loss (within 12 hours) of  cells with influx of macrophages and evidence of -cell phagocytosis (Fig
 B)
  Glucose levels increased within 24 hours following MTZ treatment (Fig
 1C, blue line) compared to untreated control fish, whose levels remained unchanged (Fig
 1C, black line)
  To demonstrate that -cell damage and loss were at least partially attributable to macrophage activity, we repeated the MTZ ablation experiment following trans-pericardial injection with 5 mg/mL clodronate liposomes at 3 days post-fertilization
  Clodronate sequesters and depletes macrophages []
  In clodronate-injected fish we observed significant reduction in hyperglycemia (Fig

  In this transgenic line, pre-existing  cells will be labeled yellow following photoconversion (combined red and green), whereas neogenic -cells formed after the UV exposure will be labeled green (Fig

  MTZ to induce -cell stress
  When  cells were injured, the control-injected fish showed -cell neogenesis at 24 hours of recovery that increased 3-fold by 48 hours of recovery (Fig
 G-H)
  By contrast, at both 24 and 48 hours after -cell ablation, clodronate-injected fish showed significantly decreased  cell neogenesis relative to controls, with no increase at 48 hours (Fig
 G-H)
  These data indicate that -cell number is greater in the fish lacking macrophages because of persistence of pre-existing  cells rather than -cell neogenesis
  To ensure that our macrophage tissue injury model was not peculiar to MTZ treatment, we also performed mechanical tailfin injury assays in 3 dpf Tg(mpeg:eGFP) zebrafish
  In the tailfin injury assay (shown schematically in Fig
 1I), macrophages rapidly migrate to the injury site as part of an inflammatory response []
  Following the injury, macrophages were observed to migrate to the site of tissue injury, as expected, whereas in clodronate-injected fish macrophages were not observed at the site of injury (Fig

 ;     Previous studies in mouse models of T1D demonstrated that global deletion or chemical inhibition of the enzyme 12-LOX reduces the early infiltration of macrophages into islets, preserves -cell mass, and prevents hyperglycemia [,]
  We recently demonstrated the presence of a zebrafish 12-LOX ortholog encoded by alox12, which exhibits similar catalytic activity and product profiles (including the production of 12-HETE) to the mouse and human enzymes []
  To test a role for 12-LOX in -cell injury mediated by macrophages, we utilized the zebrafish -cell injury model in the transgenic line Tg(ins:NTR) following depletion of -LOX by injection of a translation-blocking antisense morpholino (alox12 MO) []
  With MTZ treatment there was a time-dependent reduction in -cell number, with only 6% of  cells remaining at 24 h (Fig
 A-B)
  By contrast, there was significant preservation of  cells when the fish were treated with alox12 MO, with about 25% of  cells remaining at 24 h following MTZ (Fig
 A-B)
  Next, we utilized the double-transgenic line Tg(ins:NTR);(mpeg:eGFP) to track the influx of macrophages following  cell injury in the presence or absence of alox12 MO
  As expected, MTZ treatment resulted in the migration of macrophages into the islet in control-injected fish (Fig
 2C-D), whereas in alox12 MO fish there was a significant 
7-fold reduction in macrophage numbers (Fig
 C-D)
  The reduction of macrophages at the site of -cell injuring following the alox12 MO was likely due to a reduction of macrophage migration rather than reduction in total macrophage numbers, since macrophages persist elsewhere in the embryo (unlike with clodronate injection) (Supplementary Fig
 S1A), and similar macrophage numbers were seen in the immediate vicinity of the islet in injured alox12 MO fish compared to control-To support our findings with the alox12 MO, we next repeated these studies utilizing ML355, a small molecule inhibitor of 12-LOX []
  As shown in Fig
 2E-F, when 12-LOX activity was inhibited by treatment of fish with 10 M ML355, macrophage infiltration into the injured islets was reduced

 12-LOX in macrophages is required for T1D progression in the mouse  To assess the applicability of our zebrafish findings to an established mammalian model of T1D, we next studied the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model
  We tested the hypothesis that 12-LOX in macrophages is responsible for the progression to T1D in NOD mice by generating a myeloid lineage-specific deletion of Alox15 on the NOD background (NOD:Aloxmyel)
  NOD mice harboring the Lyz2-Cre allele were crossed to NOD mice harboring Cre recombinase sites (Loxp) flanking exons 2-5 of the Alox15 gene [,]
  To test for tissue specificity of the knockout, Alox15 mRNA was measured in peritoneal cells (containing mostly macrophages), spleen, and islets using quantitative PCR
  NOD-Alox15myel mice exhibited a significant reduction in Alox15 expression in peritoneal cells compared to control littermates, whereas Alox15 expression in spleen and pancreatic islets were unchanged (Fig
 NOD:Alox15Loxp/Loxp) for the spontaneous development of T1D, defined as two consecutive morning blood glucoses >250 mg/dl
  As shown in Fig
 3B, whereas 75-80% of female control littermates developed diabetes by 25 weeks of age, only 
5% of female NOD:Alox15myel mice developed diabetes
  Similar striking findings were observed in male mice: 50% of controls developed diabetes by 25 weeks of age, whereas 0% of NOD:Alox15myel developed diabetes (Fig
 C)
  These findings suggest that the T1D-protective phenotype previously described in global Alox15-/- mice [18] might be ascribed at least in part to its effect in macrophages
  To characterize islet pathology in NOD mice, we next performed immunostaining of pancreas sections from NOD:Alox15myel mice and NOD:Lyz2-Cre controls at 8 weeks of age, a timepoint when insulitis is established but prior to the development of TD

  To assess quantitatively if the autoimmune response was altered in NOD:Alox15myel mice, we collected pancreatic lymph nodes and performed flow cytometry for immune cell populations
 Fig

 These alterations in macrophage and dendritic cell populations were specific to the pancreatic lymph node, since these cell populations were unchanged in the spleen (Supplementary Fig

  We isolated peritoneal macrophages from Alox15-/- mice or their WT littermates, performed polarization studies in vitro, then monitored phenotypes by flow cytometry
  Macrophages were polarized to the classical proinflammatory M1-like state using a combination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFN- or to the alternative anti-inflammatory M-like state using IL-4 []
  The macrophages from both WT and Alox15-/- mice showed indistinguishable propensity to polarize to an M1 state, as assessed by flow cytometry of M1 marker iNOS (Supplementary Fig
 S4A), by IL-6 secretion (Supplementary Fig

  Similarly, upon alternative polarization, macrophages from both WT and Alox15-/- mice showed no differences by flow cytometry in the M2 marker CD206 (Supplementary Fig

  Taken together, these data indicate that 12-LOX activity is not required for cytokine- Next, we addressed if 12-LOX is required for the ability of cells of the myeloid lineage to migrate
  Migration is a critical factor in the ability of myeloid cells to carry out immune surveillance, locate to sites of injury, and present antigen
  To address the potential role of -LOX in macrophage migration, we first leveraged the tailfin injury model in Tg(mpeg:eGFP) transgenic zebrafish
 alox12 MO and control fish underwent tailfin injury at 3 dpf, and the number of macrophages migrating to the site of injury was quantitated
  In control fish, we observed the expected migration of macrophages to the site of injury within 6 hours, whereas in alox12 MO fish there was a significant 38% reduction in the number of macrophages at the site of injury (Fig

  Similar to what we macrophage migration towards injured sites by 37% as compared to vehicle-treated control To verify that our findings were specific to 12-LOX in macrophages and to confirm their applicability to mammals, we isolated peritoneal macrophages from both Alox15-/- mice and their littermate controls and performed migration assays in vitro using transwell chambers
  To mimic conditions seen in T1D, we added conditioned culture media from proinflammatory cytokine-treated (IL-1, IFN-, TNF-) mouse islets to induce migration (Fig
 C)
  As shown and quantitated in Fig
 5D, we observed a significant reduction in the number of Alox15-/- peritoneal macrophages that transited the transwell membrane compared to WT control macrophages
  These results, consistent with the zebrafish studies, indicate that 12-LOX in Prior studies suggest that 12-LOX and its product 12-HETE alters chemokine receptor expression []
  We hypothesized that the macrophage migratory defect we observed in the absence of 12-LOX may be attributable to loss of one or more of these chemokine receptors
  We measured the mRNA expression of chemokine receptors Cxcr1, Ccr2, and Cxcr3 implicated in macrophage migration in peritoneal macrophages from Alox15-/- and control littermate mice
  Of the receptor-encoding mRNAs examined, only Cxcr3 levels were significantly reduced in Alox15-/- macrophages (Fig

 ;     In this study, we leveraged the power of a lower model organism and applied these observations to an established mammalian model of T1D to interrogate the participation of myeloid-derived cells in the pathogenesis of insulitis and diabetes progression
  Cells of myeloid lineage give rise to a host of circulating cell types, most notably cells of the innate immune system that include monocytes, macrophages, and antigen-presenting dendritic cells
  Although such cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of T1D, and prior studies have attempted myeloid-specific deletions in T1D mouse models [35], we believe our findings are the first to directly demonstrate how manipulation of a signaling pathway specifically in myeloid cells can alter T1D pathophysiology
  Key findings from our study suggest (a) that macrophages are active participants in -cell dysfunction and loss in models of both islet injury and autoimmunity, dendritic cells that subsequently affects the nature of insulitis and eventual susceptibility to T1D, and (c) that the Tg(ins:NTR) zebrafish transgenic line provides a highly genetically manipulable platform wherein crosstalk between macrophages and  cells can be modeled and vetted
  Islet-resident myeloid cells have been implicated in the pathogeneses of both T1D and T2D [,]
  In NOD mice, prior studies have emphasized the role of such resident cells as initiators of the autoimmune response, owing perhaps to their role as antigen presenting cells
  These studies focused on depletion of macrophages, using either clodronate liposomes [11,13,15,16] or neutralization of a receptor (CSF1 receptor) promoting their development []
  Studies of Unanue and colleagues [14] demonstrated that delivery of a neutralizing antibody against the colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) receptor at 3 weeks of age in NOD mice resulted in the depletion of islet-resident macrophages and was accompanied by reduction in CD4 T cells and dendritic cells in the insulitic milieu and protected against diabetes
  These results align with ours, in which deletion of Alox15 in macrophages on the NOD background resulted in significant reduction in insulitis, CD4 T cells, and protection from diabetes in both male and (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

  Moreover, our findings in vivo that myeloid-specific depletion of Alox15 reduces pro-inflammatory dendritic cells and enhances expression of the mRNA encoding the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1 suggests that the effects we observed may be related to altered antigen presentation and or adaptive immune cell activation, respectively
  Collectively, our results emphasize that early intervention in the activity of myeloid cells imparts a disease-modifying effect in T1D, but more importantly that depletion of the islet-resident populations of  An important new finding in our studies is the identification that 12-LOX controls a signaling pathway that affects chemokine receptor expression in macrophages
  The gene encoding 12-LOX (Alox15) is expressed in islet  cells and macrophages, but not T cells or B cells of the adaptive immune system []
  Although Alox15 deletion was previously shown to protect against T1D in NOD mice [18], it has remained unclear if the effect could be attributed to its expression islets, myeloid cells, or both, particularly since proinflammatory cytokines and their signaling are affected by loss of Alox15 in both cell types ([,]
  Our studies in zebrafish provided initial evidence for a defect in macrophage function upon loss of the zebrafish ortholog, since macrophage entry into the islet and subsequent engulfment of  cells appeared defective in alox12 morphants upon MTZ injury
  Though it is tempting to speculate that the phenotype in these morphants was attributable to the loss of alox12 in macrophages, our studies of conditional Alox15 deletion in myeloid-derived cells in NOD mice proved more conclusive in this regard
  Importantly, whereas prior studies of Cre recombinase expression on the NOD background leave some doubt as to the effect of the deletion vs
 the misexpression of Cre recombinase on diabetes outcome [38], we show rigorously here that inclusion of littermate controls containing either the homozygous Loxp alleles or expressing Cre recombinase develop T1D at the expected frequencies in both sexes

 ;     The mechanism by which 12-LOX promotes T1D progression has been variably attributed to cytokine signaling, oxidative stress, and cellular apoptosis induced by its major majority of these prior studies were performed in islets and  cell-derived cell lines
  Here, we demonstrate new mechanisms by which 12-LOX impacts myeloid cell function in TD
  We show that 12-LOX is not required for the apparent polarization of macrophages to pro- or anti-inflammatory states, suggesting that its effects may be more specific to functional duties commonly ascribed to myeloid cells
  The chemokine receptor CXCR3 and its ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 serve as part of the chemoattractant response during inflammation and immunity
  Here and in prior studies, CXCR3 has been shown to be expressed on myeloid-derived cells [39], and may be required for local migration for immune surveillance, antigen presentation, and tissue damage clearance
  Prior studies on the role of CXCR3 in the context of NOD mice have shown conflicting results, with some studies suggesting that its deficiency protects against diabetes [40] and others suggesting its deficiency accelerates diabetes []
  A complexity in these prior studies is the global nature of deletion and the differences in diabetes induction in these animal models
  Although our studies do not entirely resolve this issue, they do indicate a critical role of this receptor for a fundamental function of myeloid cells
  We show that 12-LOX is required for cellular migration, likely through the expression of CXCR3 in mice and its ortholog CXCR
2 in zebrafish, where re-expression of cxcr
2 specifically in macrophages restored the migratory capacity
  That the migratory defect can be rescued by transgenic re-expression emphasizes that the effect of 12-LOX is exerted at the transcriptional, rather than posttranscriptional, level
  This finding is especially relevant as 12-LOX is an enzyme with no known transcriptional function per se
  It remains possible that this transcriptional effect is the result of the downstream activity of GPR31, a receptor for 12-HETE [,]
  Further studies of Gpr31 mutant zebrafish and mice will be required to address this issue

 ;     A final major implication of our study is the relevance of zebrafish
  We present a model system in which macrophages play a central role in destruction of  cells in a transgenic Tg(ins:NTR) line of zebrafish
  In the absence of adaptive immune cell involvement in our zebrafish model, it would be inaccurate to claim that this system models TD
  Nevertheless, this model system exhibits some features that allow its use as a platform for the study the dynamics between macrophages and  cells
  We showed that depletion of macrophages in zebrafish using clodronate preserved pre-existing  cells following MTZ treatment of zebrafish, yet prevented the formation of neogenic  cellsthe combined effect of which may have resulted in only the modest effect on glycemia that we observed
  On the one hand, these findings reflect similar studies in NOD mice in which clodronate treatment preserved  cells and glycemia [11,11,16] and, on the other, they support studies in mice that macrophages promote -cell proliferation tissue regeneration [,]
  This seemingly dichotomous finding likely macrophages, which are not differentiated by clodronate treatment
  By contrast, our studies with alox12 MO and the 12-LOX inhibitor ML355 appears to target the pro-diabetogenic (presumably M1-like) macrophages, findings that are supported by our tissue-specific knockout studies in NOD mice
  In ongoing studies, our laboratory is interrogating the potential existence of different macrophage phenotypes in zebrafish, the implications of which would broaden further the applicability of zebrafish models for interrogating innate immune-mediated tissue  In conclusion, our findings support a role for macrophages and dendritic cells in the initiation of T1D, but more importantly implicate a central role for 12-LOX in promoting the initial innate immune response during diabetes pathogenesis

 ;    permit cellular migration, antigen acquisition and presentation, as well as production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-)
  The deletion or inhibition of 12-LOX in the early phases of T1D impairs these processes, thereby reducing antigen acquisition and presentation, insulitis, and -cell loss
  This model does not explicitly exclude an independent role for 12-LOX in  cells, where it promotes pro-inflammatory signaling leading to cellular stress and apoptosis
  Whether deletion of Alox15 in  cells might independently disrupt this interaction between cells remains an ongoing goal of our laboratory
  Some limitations of our study are worth noting
  Our study deleted 12-LOX from the inception of Lyz2 expression in all myeloid cells during mouse development; hence, it remains unclear (a) if its role beyond macrophages and dendritic cells (such as neutrophils) might also contribute to the phenotype observed, and (b) if the loss of Alox15 during myeloid cell development might have inherently prevented the acquisition of a pro-diabetogenic phenotype before even the initiation of the disease process
  The latter point could have implications for the timing of targeted therapeutics
