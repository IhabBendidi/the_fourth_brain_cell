 ;    Recent evidence for a significant interference of microcrystalline hydroxapatite (HAP) 36 particles with re- and demineralisation processes at the tooth-biofilm interface sug-37 gested, that they may be promising candidates for efficacious caries prevention
  38 This multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial evaluated the impact of the 39 2 x daily use of a HAP dentifrice without fluoride on the progression of enamel caries 40 in adolescent caries-risk patients subjected to orthodontic therapy, with a fluoridated 41 AmF/SnF dentifrice serving as a positive control
 Primary study outcome was the 42 occurrence of enamel caries lesions  ICDAS (International Caries Detection and 43 Assessment System) code 1 around orthodontic brackets on the vestibular surfaces 44 of teeth 15-25 within the 168 days observation period
 Secondary study outcomes 45 were the occurrence of enamel caries lesion  ICDAS code 2, Plaque Index (PlI) and 46 Gingival Index (GI)
 Out of 150 recruited patients, 147 were included in the intent to 47 treat analysis (ITT); 133 finished the study per protocol (PP)
 PP data analysis 48 revealed the occurrence of enamel caries  ICDAS code 1 in 
7% of the HAP 49 group patients compared to 
9% of the fluoride control
 In the ITT analysis the 50 testing of the ITT as well as the PP data set proved that the caries preventive efficacy 52 of the HAP dentifrice was not inferior to the protection provided by the fluoridated 53 AmF/SnF control
 Regarding all assessed secondary outcomes (enamel caries  54 ICDAS code 2, GI, PlI) no significant differences between both experimental groups 55 were observed

 ;    In recent years findings, mostly derived from in vitro studies, suggested, that micro-61 crystalline hydroxyapatite (HAP) particles may be promising candidates for the 62 processes on enamel and dentine surfaces [-]
 Huang et al (2011) reported a 64 regain of mineral content and an increase in microhardness on demineralized bovine 65 enamel slabs that had subsequently been exposed to microcrystalline HAP particles 66 []
 The observed increase in mineral content proved to be pH-dependent and was 67 significantly higher under acidic conditions
 Lin et al (2014) discovered a significant 68 inhibition of future demineralisation under acidic conditions after HAP application due 69 to the formation of a protective HAP layer over the prism-prism sheath interfaces, 70 where enamel dissolution usually is initiated []
 In an in situ - study the use of a zinc-71 colonization on bovine enamel slabs worn intraorally by healthy volunteers []
 73 Hannig and Hannig (2010) put these in situ and in vitro findings into a more compre-74 hensive perspective by stating that already physiological tooth wear constantly 75 releases HAP particles into the oral environment, which may subsequently interfere 76 with de- and remineralisation processes as well as with the metabolism of the oral 77 microbiota at the tooth-bacterial biofilm interface []
 The impact of microcrystalline 78 HAP as an ingredient of dentifrices has been positively evaluated in controlled clinical 79 trials regarding dentinal hypersensitivity [7-10] and parameters of periodontal health 80 []
 Up to date, however, comparable data regarding the caries-preventive 81 properties of HAP toothpastes are mostly missing

 As orthodontic therapy with fixed 85 appliances is known to be associated with an increased incidence of the overgrowth 86 of a caries-promoting microbiota [16] and the development of white spot enamel 87 caries lesions [17-19], this study aimed at the assessment of the caries-preventive 88 impact of the regular use of a fluoride-free HAP dentifrice in this particular group of 89 caries risk patients
 Due to the abundant evidence for the caries preventive efficacy 90 of fluorides [20, 21], clinical caries studies may no longer involve a true negative 91 control for obvious ethical reasons
 Thus a non-inferiority trial was conducted
 The 92 study hypothesis to be tested was, that, in terms of caries prevention, the regular use 93 of the HAP test dentifrice is not inferior to the regular use of a fluoridated control with 94 The investigation was designed as a multicenter, prospective, parallel group, two 98 arm, double-blind, randomized clinical non-inferiority trial to be performed at the 99 Dresden and Frankfurt
 The study protocol was prepared in accordance with the 101 declaration of Helsinki and met the criteria of GCP
 It was approved by the ethics 102 committee of the University of Wuerzburg (file #184/13) on March 28th,

 111 At visit 1 (-4 to -28 days prior to baseline) patients scheduled for orthodontic therapy 115 were screened for study eligibility
 Those meeting it and giving informed consent 116 were subsequently scheduled for the baseline visit 2 (day )
 117 At visit 2 Plaque Index (PlI) as well as Gingival Index (GI) scores were recorded from 118 the vestibular surfaces of teeth 15 to 25 followed by professional tooth cleaning and 119 the subsequent assessment of the vestibular enamel surfaces of teeth 15 to 25 120 according to ICDAS II criteria
 Afterwards orthodontic brackets were adhesively 121 mounted to the vestibular surfaces and any excess of adhesive resin was removed
 122 No sealants, fluoride varnishes or any other caries-preventive layers surrounding the 123 brackets were applied
 Using a randomization list a supply of either the test dentifrice 124 or the control dentifrice, calculated to be adequate for 4 weeks of 2 x daily repeated 125 toothbrushing, as well as a standardized electric tooth brush (Oral-B Pulsar 35; 126 Procter & Gamble GmbH, Germany) to be used for the duration of the study, were 127 handed over to the study patients
 The dosage of the assigned dentifrice (2 x daily a 128 streak of approx
 1 g) and the use of the electric tooth brush were practically 129 instructed and the patients informed, to bring back all assigned toothpaste tubes at 130 the next scheduled visit
 At day 28 the sequence of recording PlI, GI and ICDAS II 131 scores was repeated as described for visit 
 As an additional caries-preventive 132 measure, teeth 15-25 were disinfected with a topically applied 1% chlorhexidine 133 (CHX) gel
 Toothpaste tubes supplied at visit 2 were taken back and a new supply for 134 the next 4 weeks handed over

 At day 84 (visit 5) the recording of 137 GI, PlI and ICDAS II scores as well as cleaning and disinfection were repeated as 138 described before
 Next to a new supply of toothpaste also a new Pulsar 35 electric 139 toothbrush was handed over
 At day 112 (visit 6) and at day 140 (visit 7) procedures 140 performed were identical to those at day 56 (visit )
 At day 168 (visit 8) the final 141 assessment of PlI, GI and ICDAS II scores as well as the return of the study 142 dentifrices was conducted as described before
 Furthermore, at each study visit 143 patients were asked about the occurrence of important harms or unintended effects 144 related or unrelated to the use of the study dentifrices

 Furthermore, all examiners were blinded to the dentifrice allocation of the 421 study subjects throughout the course of the study to avoid any possible examiner 422 The assessed study patients, wearing fixed orthodontic appliances, were without 426 doubt caries-active, documented by the considerable increase in enamel caries 427 lesions during the 168 days observation period, which was comparable in its 428 magnitude to observations made by other clinical trials [18, ]

 ;    dentifrices to the study participants
 It may be argued, that in the chosen setting of 432 capacities of fluorides and hydroxyapatite particles might have rendered a 434 assumption for the following reasons: In a more recent multicenter caries trial by 436 Sonesson et al (2014), assessing a comparable cohort of 424 adolescent patients 437 age 12-16 subjected to orthodontic therapy with fixed appliances, the regular use of a 438 highly concentrated 5000 ppm fluoride dentifrice was accompanied by a significantly 439 lower incidence of white spot enamel lesions when compared to the regular use of a 440 standard 1450 ppm fluoride control dentifrice []
 While this suggests, that 1450 441 ppm may not be the optimal fluoride concentration for a dentifrice to be used in 442 caries-active orthodontic patients, it evidently contradicts the assumption, that in 443 these patients the caries-preventive efficacy of fluoride is completely blocked by 444 overly acidic conditions
 On the contrary, Sonesson et al even speculated, that the 445 reduced increase in enamel caries observed for the use of the 5000 ppm fluoride 446 dentifrice may be attributable to a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of fluorides on in 447 vivo lactate production in supragingival bacterial biofilms as discovered by Takahasi 448 and Washio (2012) []
 The findings by Sonesson et al are also in line with the 449 conclusions of two meta-reviews assessing the efficacy of topical fluorides in 450 orthodontic patients subjected to therapy with fixed braces, which advocated the 451 additional use of fluoride rinses or varnishes as a complement to regular 452 toothbrushing with fluoride dentifrices [17, ]
 From a clinician's point of view the 453 caries protection provided by the sole use of both dentifrices evaluated in the present 454 trial may not have been sufficient for a sizeable part of the study participants
 This 455 may however not be interpreted as an inherent and complete lack of clinical efficacy
 456 It rather reflects the fact, that the study population deliberately and in accordance 457 remix, or adapt this material for any purpose without crediting the original authors

 ;    with the recommendations of the 2004 International Consensus Workshop on caries 458 clinical trials [33], included many subjects with a very high caries activity
 While this is 459 a condition, which clinically may only be partially controllable by the sole use of 460 conventional fluoride toothpaste not exceeding the legal fluoride concentrations limits 461 for cosmetic products, as described before, the inclusion of highly caries-active 462 individuals in a controlled caries prevention trial is an indispendable prerequisite for a 463 Whether the occurrence frequency of ICDAS code 1 enamel caries lesions used in 468 this study is the most suitable primary endpoint for an non-inferiority caries trial may 469 be subject to discussion
 However, the adjunctive analysis of the PP data set 470 regarding frequency and severity of the occurrence of enamel caries lesions during 471 the observation period depicted in table 3 only confirms the identified absence of 472 relevant differences between both experimental groups
 It may also have been 473 debatable to keep the original non-inferiority margin of  = 20% when switching the 474 primary outcome of the trial despite an overall incidence of the revised primary 475 outcome (ICDAS lesion code 1) of only %
 The subsequent analysis of the 476 unblinded PP data set however revealed, that the actual difference between both 477 experimental groups was 
2% in favour of the HAP test dentifrice with an exact 478 upper one-sided 95% confidence limit of

 ;    increase of gingival inflammation and bacterial plaque mass after the onset of 484 orthodontic therapy with fixed appliances [18, ]
 Differences between both 485 experimental groups regarding the recorded PlI and GI data could not be verified 486 statistically for any of the evaluated time points, which is also in good agreement with 487 the results of a previous trial comparing the plaque- and gingivitis-reducing properties 488 of a fluoride-free HAP test dentifrice and a fluoridated AmF/SnF control in a study 489 While the safety of fluoride-based caries prevention has been firmly established by 492 numerous studies [21], dosage and toxicity aspects have always to be considered
 493 This particularly limits the clinical feasibility of the aforementioned increase in fluoride 494 dosing in high caries-risk infants and children up to an age of 8 due to the 495 asscociated risk for the development of dental fluorosis
  Although not verified by 496 clinical studies so far , increasing the dosing or application frequency of HAP 497 toothpaste might also have a beneficial impact on clinical outcome in highly caries 498 active subjects because HAP is a potent buffer, able to neutralize organic acids in a 499 dose-dependent manner, By contrast to fluorides, increasing the applied dosage of 500 HAP particles is virtually free of any toxicity issues even in infants and children, as 501 HAP is the major mineral phase of all hard tissues within the human body []
  502 dentifrice is a viable method of clinical caries control
 The proof of non-inferiority in 506 comparison to the regular use of a  conventional fluoride dentifrice verified by this 507 trial  in a cohort of caries-active adolescents and adults may however be only a first 508 step
