 ;    Drosophila blood cells, called hemocytes, are classified into plasmatocytes, crystal cells, and lamellocytes based on the expression of a few marker genes and cell morphologies, which are inadequate to classify the complete hemocyte repertoire
 Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map hemocytes across different inflammatory conditions in larvae
 We resolved plasmatocytes into different states based on the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, antimicrobial response, and metabolism together with the identification of intermediate states
 Further, we discovered rare subsets within crystal cells and lamellocytes that express fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligand branchless and receptor breathless, respectively
 We demonstrate that these FGF components are required for mediating effective immune responses against parasitoid wasp eggs, highlighting a novel role for FGF signaling in inter-hemocyte crosstalk

 ;    The immune system forms an important layer of defense against pathogens in a wide variety of organisms including Drosophila (Banerjee et al, 2019; Mathey-Prevot and Perrimon, )
 The chief mode of immune response in flies involves innate immunity, which is composed of diverse tissue types including fat body, gut, and blood cells called the hemocytes (Buchon et al, )
 Hemocytes represent the myeloid-like immune cells, but so far have been considered less diverse compared to their vertebrate counterparts (Evans et al, 2003; Wood and Martin, )
 In addition to progenitor cells or prohemocytes, three major types of hemocytes are known in Drosophila: plasmatocytes (PM), crystal cells (CC), and lamellocytes (LM)
 PMs are macrophage-like cells with parallels to vertebrate tissue macrophages, while CCs and LMs perform functions analogous to clotting and granuloma formation in vertebrates (Buchon et al, )
 Hemocytes in the larva derive from two lineages: the lymph gland and the embryonic lineage, which in the larva forms resident (sessile) clusters of hemocytes in subepidermal locations, also known as hematopoietic pockets (Gold and Brckner, 2015; Holz et al, 2003; Jung, 2005; Makhijani et al, )
 Prohemocytes can give rise to all mature hemocytes in the lymph gland (Banerjee et al, )
 Likewise, the embryonic lineage, which consists of self-renewing PMs, is capable of producing CCs and LMs during inflammatory conditions (Gold and Brckner, 2015; Leito and Sucena, 2015; Mrkus et al, )
 Whereas PMs are important for phagocytosis and represent ~90-95% of total hemocytes, CCs, which constitute ~5%, are required for wound healing and melanization (Banerjee et al, 2019; Evans et al, )
 Importantly, CCs and LMs are required for survival upon injury or immunogenic conditions in Drosophila, highlighting the significance of these specialized blood Traditionally, the classification of hemocytes is based on two major criteria: cell morphology (Rizki, 1957, 1962; Shrestha and Gateff, 1982) and expression of a few marker genes (Evans et al, 2003, 2014; Kurucz et al, )
 The paucity of markers available to define cell types and the low-resolution of cell morphologies may have hindered the identification of rare cell types and failed to distinguish transient states
 For instance, a PM-like cell called the podocyte, which possibly corresponds to an intermediate state between PMs and LMs, has been reported but its transcriptional signature remains unknown (Honti et al, 2010; Rizki, 1957; Stofanko et al, )
 Moreover, ultrastructural and microscopic evidence has also suggested that several subsets within PMs and CCs exist, but they have not been characterized at the molecular level (Rizki, 1957; Shrestha and Gateff, )
 Finally, little is known about hemocyte lineage trajectories with regards to the source cells or precursors, or about intermediate states that exist on the path to terminal differentiation of mature cell types
 Hence, it is important to thoroughly characterize the molecular signatures of all the dynamic states of mature cell types in steady state and inflammatory conditions
  characterization of complex tissues, including blood (Satija and Shalek, )
 In particular, scRNA-seq is powerful not only for identifying cell types but also resolving cell states and their dynamic gene expression patterns that are often buried in bulk RNA measurements (Trapnell, )
 For example, recent studies using various scRNA-seq platforms have helped identify novel subtypes within monocytes and dendritic cells (Villani (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    et al, 2017) and activated states of T cells (Szabo et al, 2019) in human blood
 Further, scRNA-seq has documented the continuous spectrum of differentiation along the hematopoietic lineage in various species (Macaulay et al, 2016; Nestorowa et al, 2016; Velten et al, 2017; Zhang et al, )
 In addition, scRNA-seq data allows pseudotemporal ordering of cells to re-draw developmental trajectories of cellular lineages (Cao et al, )
 Thus, scRNA-seq, in conjunction with various lineage trajectory algorithms, allows the precise characterization of 
 differentiated cell types and their subtypes, 
 transient intermediate states, 
 progenitor or precursor states, and 
 activated states, which are often influenced by mitotic, metabolic, or immune-activated gene modules (Adlung and Amit, 2018; Trapnell, 2015; Wagner et al, )
 Here, we performed scRNA-seq of Drosophila hemocytes in unwounded, wounded, and parasitic wasp infested larvae to comprehensively distinguish mature cell types from their transient intermediate states
 Our scRNA-seq analysis identifies novel marker genes to existing cell types and distinguishes activated states within PMs enriched in various genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle, metabolism, and antimicrobial response
 In addition, we could precisely distinguish mature CCs and LMs from their respective intermediate states
 Interestingly, our scRNA-seq revealed the expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor breathless (btl) and its ligand branchless (bnl), in rare subsets of LMs and CCs, respectively, which we implicate in regulating effective immune responses against parasitoid wasp eggs in vivo
 Altogether, our scRNA-seq analysis documents the diversity of hemocyte cell populations circulating in the fly blood and provides a resource of gene expression profiles of the various cell types and their states in Drosophila
 This resource can be mined using a user-friendly searchable web-tool (www
 flyrnai
org/scRNA/blood/) where genes  Hemocyte differentiation can be induced in Drosophila larvae by mechanical wounding or oviposition by wasps such as Leptopilina boulardi (Rizki and Rizki, )
 Hence, to characterize hemocyte populations and their heterogeneity, we first performed the two immune responsive conditions: wounded and wasp 24h post-infested (wasp inf
 24h), together with unwounded (Unw) control conditions (Fig
 A)
 Further, to mobilize the sessile hemocytes into circulation, we briefly vortexed the larvae prior to bleeding (Petraki et al, )
 including inDrops (Klein et al, 2015), 10X Chromium (Zheng et al, 2017) or Drop-seq (Macosko et al, )
 A total of 19,458 cells were profiled, with 3-4 replicates per condition, and obtained a median of 1010 genes and 2883 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell across all conditions (Table S1; Fig
 S1A, B)
 In order to achieve a comprehensive map of all the hemocytes profiled by the three scRNA-seq platforms, we merged all data sets
 We observed notable batch effects where cell types were being clustered according to condition, replicate, or technology (Fig
 S1C, D, E)
 Thus, we applied the Harmony batch correcting method (Korsunsky et al, 2019), which is integrated into the Seurat R package (Stuart et al, )
 Harmony successfully integrated all three data sets, including their replicates (Fig
 1B; S1D, E), and identified a total of 17 clusters (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    (Fig
 C)
 Based on known marker genes, we confidently assigned certain clusters as plasmatocytes (PMs marked by Hemolectin [Hml]), crystal cells (CCs marked by lozenge [lz]), or lamellocytes (LMs marked by Atilla) (Fig
 1C; SG)
 Of the 17 clusters, one small cluster, representing ~
2% of the total profiled cells, did not express any of the pan-hemocyte markers such as Hemese (He) and Serpent (srp) (Fig
 S1G) (Evans et  Despite the fact that PMs constitute over 90-95% of the total hemocyte pool, subclasses within this major cell type have not been described
 The majority of the clusters we identified (12/17) express Hml but not CC or LM markers and thus we annotated them as PM clusters: PM1-12 (Fig
 1C; SG)
   PM1 represents the largest cluster and is enriched in rRNA genes such as 18SrRNA:CR45841 (Fig
 D)
 Interestingly, there is evidence in mammals that certain rRNA genes, including pre-rRNA molecules, accumulate in activated macrophages (Radzioch et al, 1987; Varesio, )
 We determined PM2 as the cycling or self-renewing state of PMs based on the expression of genes related to cell cycle such as CycB, stg, and polo, which are markers of G2/M stages of the cell cycle (Edgar and OFarrell, 1990; Glover, 2005; Whitfield et al, )
 Next, we identified a group of PM clusters, PM3-5, which are enriched in several immune-induced genes, including Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (Mmp1) and Immune induced molecule 18 (IM)
 Further, our scRNA-seq identified two distinct clusters, PM6 and 7, expressing several genes that encode antimicrobial peptides (AMP) (Fig
 D)
 PM6 highly expresses genes of the cecropin family, including CecA2 and CecC, while PM7 is enriched in additional AMPs such as Mtk, DptB, and Drs (Fig
 D)
 The differential expression of this broad spectrum of AMPs (Hoffmann and Reichhart, 2002; Tzou et al, 2002) in PM6 and 7 (collectively termed PMAMP) suggests that hemocytes can elicit a humoral immune response against a variety of pathogens
 Together, we define PM3-7 as the immune-activated states of the PMs because of the expression of several immune-induced genes including the AMP-genes
  In addition to these major clusters, our scRNA-seq also identified several minor clusters: PM-
 PM8 is enriched in genes encoding peroxidase enzymes such as Prx2540-1, Prx2540-2, and CG12896, which is an uncharacterized gene highly similar to peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) in humans
 Although the function of these genes is not known in the context of hemocytes and immunity, peroxisomes have been reported to be necessary for phagocytosis by macrophages in both mice and Drosophila (Di Cara et al, )
 PM9 and PM10 are enriched in the protooncogenes Abl, Sno oncogene (Snoo), and the transcriptional regulator Ultrabithorax (Ubx)
 PM11 and PM12 represent the smallest clusters within PMs and are defined by the expression of the uncharacterized genes CG15550 and CG6023, together with a methuselah-type receptor gene, methuselah-like 7 (mthl7) in PM11, and Cys, CG8860, and COX8 in PM12 (Fig
 1D; Table S)

 ;     The next most abundant immune responsive cells are the CCs, which are the main source of two enzymes important for melanization, prophenoloxidase 1 and 2 (PPO1 and PPO)
 These enzymes are critical for survival upon wounding in larvae and adults (Binggeli et al, 2014; Dudzic et al, 2019; Theopold et al, )
 Based on the expression of PPO1 and PPO2 together with the gene encoding the Runt related transcription factor Lz, two clusters were assigned to CCs: CC1 and CC2 (Fig
 1C-D; SG)
 CC1 expresses low levels of PPO1 but high levels of Notch, pebbled (peb), and the enhancer of split complex gene E(spl)m-HLH (Fig
 D)
 Although Notch and peb have been shown to be associated with CC development (Terriente-Felix et al, 2013), expression of the Notch target gene E(spl)m3-HLH (Couturier et al, 2019) has not been reported
 On the other hand, CC2 shows higher expression levels of PPO1 and PPO2 genes
 Hence, we consider CC2 to represent mature CCs, while CC1 may represent an immature or a transient intermediate  LMs represent the rarest cell type, the numbers of which dramatically increase during wounding and wasp infestation (Mrkus et al, 2005; Rizki and Rizki, )
 Based on the expression of the LM marker gene Atilla (Evans et al, 2014; Kurucz et al, 2007), we assigned two clusters to LMs: LM1 and LM2 (Fig
 1C-D; SG)
 LM1 is the larger cluster of the two and is enriched in Atilla besides a long non-coding RNA, lncRNA:CR44316 (Fig
 D)
 LM2 represents a smaller cluster expressing Atilla, betaTub60D, and alphaTubE
 The expression level of Atilla is higher in LM2 compared to LM1 (Fig
 1D), suggesting that LM2 represents mature LMs, whereas LM1 may represent the LM intermediate state
 Moreover, the strong expression pattern of tubulins and other cytoskeletal proteins may be important for the maintenance of structural integrity of LMs and their dynamic roles in encapsulation (Rizki and Rizki, )
 Altogether, our scRNA-seq analysis recovered all major cell types within the hemocyte repertoire including the fine-grained dissection of PMs into self-renewing or cell-cycle (PM2) and various immune-activated states (PM-)
 The functions of the newly identified genes in the rest of the PM clusters, which are minor subpopulations except for PM1, remain to be characterized
 Presumably, these subpopulations represent transiting intermediates along the course of terminal differentiation or activated states of PMs and other cell types
 We also identified two clusters each for CCs and LMs, which display differential expression of their marker genes, PPO1 and Atilla, respectively (Fig
 1D; see Table S2 for additional marker genes)
  PMs of the embryonic lineage reside in larval hematopoietic pockets and, over the course of third larval instar, increasingly enter the hemolymph to circulate in the open circulatory system (Makhijani et al, )
 The generation of these PMs, initially by differentiation from embryonic progenitors, and later in the larva through self-renewal of differentiated PMs, is well established (Makhijani et al, )

 ;    development of terminally differentiated CCs and LMs from the embryonic lineage has remained speculative, but includes models of transdifferentiation from PMs (Anderl et al, 2016; Leito and Sucena, 2015; Mrkus et al, )
 Since hemocyte progenitors reside only in the lymph gland and are absent in circulation or sessile compartments (Jung et al, 2005), it is important to address the immediate sources of mature cell types in circulation
 scRNA-seq data can be used to construct pseudotemporal relationships between individual cell transcriptomes and impute cell lineages derived from precursor cells (Trapnell, 2015; Trapnell et al, )
 We took advantage of our observation that PM2 expresses cell cycle genes to construct lineage trees emerging from this cell-cycle state
 To avoid using batch corrected cells, we chose 10X genomics-derived wounded data set (Fig
 S2A; Table S1), which represents all the mature cell types
 We used Monocle3 (Cao et al, 2019) and assigned PM2 as the start point of the pseudotime intervals (Fig
 2A-B; SA-C)
 Monocle3 data shows that three major lineages emerge from the start point (Fig
 C-E)
 Lineage1 terminates in CC fate, and includes the two CC clusters, CC1 and CC
 As expected, CC1 precedes CC2, strongly supporting that CC1 represents an intermediate state (CCint) (Fig
 B)
 Consistently, the expression of PPO1 steadily increases from CC1 and reaches its peak level upon becoming mature CCs (Fig
 F)
 Lineage2 on the other hand terminates in a fate that include PM1 and other minor PM clusters (PM8-12) (Fig
 2B, D)
 Lastly, Lineage3 leads towards the clusters of the immune-activated state together with mature LMs (Fig
 2B, E)
 As expected, LM1 precedes LM2, supporting our initial observation that LM1 corresponds to the intermediate state of LMs (LMint)
 This is further demonstrated by the expression of Atilla, which steadily increases with low levels in LM1 and higher levels in LM2 (Fig
 G)
 Lineage3 also terminates with cells of the immune-activated state, PM7 and PM5 (Fig
 2B), which express Drs (in PM7) and genes pertaining to glycolysis and GSTs (in PM5) (Fig
 2H; SF-H)
  Next, to gain deeper insights into the gene expression signatures along the pseudotime intervals, we analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEG) between the source and Lineage1 or Lineage
 DEG analysis over pseudotime revealed four major clusters depending on the expression of marker genes at the beginning (pre-branch) and end of the pseudotime interval along Lineage1 and 3 (Fig
 I)
 Interestingly, the pre-branch is enriched with PM marker genes such as eater and Hml, suggesting that precursor cells are indeed the self-renewing PMs
 Moreover, the expression of the cell cycle genes gradually decrease as the lineages progress towards 1 or 3 (Fig
 2I), consistent with a relationship between cell cycle arrest and terminal differentiation in vertebrates (Morse et al, 1997; Ruijtenberg and van den Heuvel, 2016; Soufi and Dalton, )
 To assess whether blocking the cell cycle promotes terminal differentiation, we expressed RNAi against one of the top enriched cell cycle genes, polo, in Hml+ PMs (HmlGAL>polo-i)
 RNAi-mediated knockdown of polo resulted in a significant increase in the production of LMs compared to controls (Fig
 S2I-K), suggesting that cell cycle arrest may be required for terminal differentiation of cell types
 Finally, to visualize cells accumulating along the pseudotime intervals, we analyzed the cell densities using ridge plots, which revealed that PM8-12 accumulated predominantly between the start and end of pseudotime intervals, indicating that  Altogether, based on Monocle3, we propose that PM2 has oligopotent potential and can give rise to terminally differentiated cell types and possibly other activated states within PMs

 ;    confirms the existence of CC and LM intermediate states that precede their fully differentiated mature cell Changes in hemocyte composition and identification of a novel Mtk-like AMP  In addition to identifying genes enriched in each cluster and their changes across conditions, it is possible to estimate cell fraction changes from scRNA-seq data sets
 To achieve this, we first segregated the three conditions (Fig
 3A-C), then calculated cell fraction changes
 Whereas PM1-5, 8, and 11 were well represented in all three conditions, PM9 is negligibly detected in the wasp inf
 24h condition and PM10 and 12 were majorly detected in the wounded condition
 The PMAMP clusters, PM6 and 7, emerged mainly upon wounding or wasp infestation compared to Unw controls (Fig
 A-D)
 Strikingly, both CC1 and CC2 were underrepresented in wasp inf
 24h, consistent with previous observations that CC numbers dramatically decrease following oviposition by wasps (Kacsoh and Schlenke, 2012) (Fig
 A-D)
 Of the LM clusters, LM1 was detected in all three conditions, however, LM2 emerged only upon wounding or wasp infestation
 In summary, LM2 and PMAMP are the major clusters that are represented mostly upon wounding or wasp  Despite some PM clusters being represented in all three conditions, their gene expression patterns are specific to wounding or wasp inf
 h
 For instance, Mmp1 showed increased expression only upon wounding or wasp inf
 24h in PM3 compared to Unw controls (Fig
 SA)
 Likewise, the increased expression of GST genes such as GstE6 is specific to wounded or wasp inf
 24h (Fig
 SB)
 With regards to the PM6 cluster of immune-activated state, CecA2 showed an increased expression specifically in wasp inf
 24h compared to wounded conditions (Fig
 SC)
 Further, DEG analysis of PM7 revealed that most of the AMP genes were expressed only during wounding or wasp inf
 24h and not in Unw controls (Fig
 E)
 Of note, the AMP gene signature was unique to either wounded or wasp inf
 24h conditions
 For example, whereas Mtk, Drs, DptB, and AttD were specific to wounded condition, CecA1, CecB, Dro, and AttA were unique to wasp inf
 24h (Fig
 E)
 These data indicate that clusters represented in all three conditions may nevertheless differ from each other in a condition-specific manner with respect to their differential gene signatures (Table S)
  A survey of all top enriched genes in PM7 revealed the identification of an uncharacterized gene, CG43236 (Fig
 E)
 CG43236 encodes a small peptide of 50 amino acids (aa) and its phylogenetic alignment with all known AMPs revealed that it clustered with Mtk, an antibacterial and antifungal AMP (Levashina et al, 1995, 1998) (Fig
 3F, G)
 Both Mtk and CG43236 possess an Antimicrobial10 domain that is unique to the Metchnikowin family (Fig
 3G; S3D-D), leading us to name CG43236 as Mtk-like (Mtkl)
 To validate its expression within hemocytes and whole larvae, we performed qRT-PCR in Unw control and wounded conditions
 Consistent with our scRNA-seq data (Fig
 3E), CG43236 is well expressed in Unw control hemocytes based on average Ct values compared to Rp49 (Fig
 SE)
 However, the induction of CG43236 was modest, if any, compared to the robust induction of CecC, Drs, and Mtk upon wounding in hemocytes (Fig
 S3F), suggesting that CG43236 may be strongly regulated by additional modes of wounding such as sepsis or fungal infection
 However, its expression was strongly induced upon wounding in whole larvae, indicating that (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    CG43236 may also be expressed by non-hemocytic cells (Fig
 SG)
 Finally, the expression levels of both Mtk and CG43236 gradually increase in Lineage3 over pseudotime intervals, indicating their specificity to this lineage where PM7 terminates (Fig
 3H, I)
 Altogether, the DEG analysis of PM7 identified a novel Mtk-like  Because CCs split into two distinct clusters (CC1 and CC2) (Fig
 1C), we sub-clustered these cells independently of the other clusters
 We used Harmony to correct for batch effects arising from the technological platforms and conditions (Fig
 S4A, B)
 Subsequent cell clustering revealed two distinct clusters: one with low PPO1 expression (PPO1low) and one with very high PPO1 expression (PPO1high) (Fig
 4A, C)
 While the percentage of PPO1low CCs was higher than that of the mature PPO1high CCs, the fraction of these cells increased upon wounding (Fig
 4B, SC-E)
 Furthermore, the expression level of PPO1 was similar between Unw controls and wounded condition in both clusters
 Interestingly, its expression was negligibly detected in PPO1low CCs and slightly lower in PPO1high CCs in wasp infested larvae (Fig
 D)
 To determine whether the two CC clusters coexist as distinct populations or whether PPO1low is a CCint state along the course of CC maturation, we used LzGAL4, UAS-GFP; BcF6-mCherry larvae to label Lz+ and PPO1+ CCs with GFP and mCherry, respectively
 We examined the dorso-posterior end, where clusters of hemocytes that include CCs reside along the dorsal vessel of larvae (Fig
 4E) (Leito and Sucena, )
 In line with the scRNA-seq data, in vivo imaging analysis revealed distinct populations of CCs within the sessile hub, with CCs displaying differential intensities of GFP and mCherry (Fig
 F-F)
 Furthermore, intensity measurements of GFP and mCherry revealed a significant positive correlation (Fig
 4G), which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that Lz, together with Srp, can activate the expression of PPO1 (Waltzer et al, )
 Of note, the correlation plot did not reveal two separate populations of CCs, but rather heterogenous cell populations, existing in a potential continuum (Fig
 G)
 This further supports the Monocle3 prediction that PPO1low may represent the CCint state, whereas PPO1high corresponds to mature CCs (Fig
 2B, F)
  As noted above, PPO1high CCs express many of the mature CC marker genes, including PPO2 (Fig
 H)
 This cluster also highly expresses a number of uncharacterized genes such as CG10602 and CG10467, which potentially encode enzymes with epoxide hydrolase and aldose 1-epimerase activities, respectively (Fig
 H)
 The human ortholog of CG10602, LTA4H (leukotriene A4 hydrolase), encodes an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of a proinflammatory mediator, leukotriene B4 (Crooks and Stockley, )
 Moreover, mutations in lta4h render zebrafish hypersusceptible to mycobacterial infections (Tobin et al, )
 These observations suggest that CG10602 may play an important role for mature CCs in combating bacterial infections, in addition to their role in melanization
 On the contrary, PPO1low CCs are enriched in spatzle (spz), a cytokine that activates the Toll pathway (Lemaitre et al, 1996) (Fig
 H)
 Besides spz, PPO1low CCs express cell cycle/chromatin associated genes such as the Decondensation factor 31 (Df31) and HmgD (Fig
 4H), suggesting that PPO1low may be in a cycling or proliferative state
 Furthermore, although many of the genes, including spz, Df31, and HmgD, were more enriched upon wasp inf
 24h in PPO1low (Fig
 4I), the PPO1high (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    cluster did not display notable changes in gene expression (Fig
 SF)
 Of note, we confirmed the expression of a novel CC marker gene E(spl)m3-HLH, which is expressed in ~13% of CCs in both PPO1low and PPO1high populations (Fig
 SG-G)
 In addition, Monocle3 revealed an enrichment of E(spl)m3-HLH in the CC2 cluster in Lineage1 (the CC lineage) over the pseudotime intervals (Fig
 S4H), suggesting that it is expressed early during CC development
 In summary, CC sub-clustering identifies a CC intermediate state and highlights the possibility that CCs exist in a continuum, along the course of CC maturation, as suggested by Monocle3 and in  Previous studies have speculated the presence of LM intermediates (Anderl et al, 2016; Honti et al, 2010; Rizki, 1957; Stofanko et al, )
 Monocle3 predicted that LM1 might correspond to a LM intermediate state (Fig
 2B, G, J)
 To further test this prediction, we sub-clustered all the Atilla+ LMs derived from all conditions
 To increase the diversity of LMs, we performed scRNA-seq at one additional time point of wasp infestation: wasp inf
 h
 Clustering analysis revealed that more than 50% of all cells are of the LM lineage (SA-C)
 To sub-cluster the LMs, we considered the Atilla+ clusters 0 and 1 from wasp inf
 48h (Fig
 S5A-B) together with Atilla+ LMs from Unw, wounded, and wasp inf
 24h data sets (Fig
 C-D)
 We used Harmony to correct for batch effects (Fig
 S5D-E) and subsequent clustering of all the LMs revealed 5 distinct clusters (Fig
 5A), that we named LM1-4 and CC based on the expression of top enriched genes (Fig
 E)
 Cell fraction calculations revealed that all the clusters, especially LM4 and CC, were predominantly derived from wasp inf
 48h condition (Fig
 5B; SE-I)
 The last cluster was annotated as CC based on extremely low or no expression of Atilla and enrichment of CC marker genes including PPO1 (Fig
 5C, E)
 We speculate that LM1 may represent a LMint state based on the low level of Atilla together with enrichment of PM marker genes such as Pxn and Hml, which are usually not expressed upon LM maturation (Fig
 2I; 5E) (Stofanko et al, )
 Interestingly, expression of Atilla is negligible in Unw control and wounded conditions, while Hml is higher  Based on the high level of expression of Atilla, we conclude that LM2, LM3, and LM4 are subtypes of mature LMs (Fig
 C)
 Whereas LM3 and LM4 expressed relatively low levels of Trehalase (Treh) and its transporter Tret1-1, LM2 displayed high levels of these genes (Fig
 E)
 In addition to Treh and Tret1-1, almost all LM2 cells express two uncharacterized genes that potentially encode sugar transporters, CG4607 and CG1208 (Fig
 5E, F)
 These genes emerged as the top-expressed genes in wasp inf
 48h when compared to the Unw control, wounded, or wasp inf
 24h conditions (Fig
 F)
 Of note, CG4607 and CG1208 belong to the SLC2 family of hexose sugar transporters and are orthologous to SLC2A6/GLUT6 or SLC2A8/GLUT8 in humans
 Importantly, it has recently been demonstrated that GLUT6 acts as a lysosomal transporter, which is regulated by inflammatory stimuli (Maedera et al, 2019) and is strongly upregulated in macrophages activated by LPS (Caruana et al, )
 Similarly, in Drosophila, immune activation is energy demanding and glucose may be used as a major source of energy for the production of mature LMs (Bajgar et al, )

 ;    observations suggest that LMs may require specialized sugar transporters for their maturation to elicit an  In addition to the expression of the sugar transporters, all LM sub-clusters are enriched in a water transporter, Drip (AQP4 in humans), which has recently been shown to play a role in T-cell proliferation and activation in mice (Nicosia et al, 2019) (Fig
 5F; SJ-L)
 To confirm Drip expression in vivo, third instar DripGAL4, UAS-mCD8-GFP; BcF6-mCherry larvae were wounded and then monitored for the expression of Drip
 As expected, Drip+ GFP cells were not detected during steady state in Unw control larvae (Fig
 5G-G, I)
 However, Drip+ GFP cells, significantly increased upon wounding, and strikingly, the expression of Drip was detected in ~90% of Atilla+ LMs (Fig
 5H-H, I)
 Finally, the smaller clusters of LMs, LM3 and LM4, were also enriched in genes similar to those expressed in LM2, albeit at a lower level (Fig
 5E), suggesting that LM3-4 are subtypes of mature LMs
 In contrast to LM3, LM4 expresses additional marker genes that include GstD3 suggesting that this subtype of LMs may also be involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics (Fig
 5E; SL)
 In summary, LM sub-clustering identified the LMint state together with novel marker genes specific to scRNA-seq uncovers a novel role for the FGF pathway in immune response  To identify signaling pathways enriched in each cluster, we performed pathway enrichment analysis on the scRNA-seq data across all conditions (Fig
 A)
 As expected, the PM6 and PM7 clusters are enriched in Imd and to lesser extent Toll signaling pathways (Lemaitre and Hoffmann, )
 CC1 and CC2 are highly enriched in Notch signaling components (Fig
 6A; Table S4), which is consistent with previous studies that showed the importance of Notch in CC development (Duvic et al, 2002; Leito and Sucena, )
 Further, PM3 was highly enriched in particular for components of the TNF-alpha, Imd, and Toll pathways
 In addition to these known pathways, we also identified the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway to be highly enriched in the LMs (Fig
 6A; Table S)
 Although the fly FGFR, Heartless (Htl) and its ligands, Thisbe (Ths) and Pyramus (Pyr) have been shown to be required for progenitor differentiation in the lymph gland (Dragojlovic-Munther and Martinez-Agosto, 2013), the role of FGF signaling has not been addressed in circulating hemocytes of the embryonic lineage
 Interestingly, the second FGFR gene, breathless (btl), is one of the components that is enriched albeit at low levels in LM2 (Fig
 6B, B)
 In addition, a small subpopulation of CCs expresses branchless (bnl), which encodes the only ligand for Btl (Fig
 6B, B)
  To confirm the expression of bnl in hemocytes upon wounding, we used bnl-lexA; lexAOp-GFP, BcF-mCherry larvae and found that bnl expression was restricted either to CCs or PMs but not LMs (Fig
 6C, C; SB)
 In addition, based on bnl expression counts from scRNA-seq, bnl may be enriched in PPO1high compared to PPO1low CCs (Fig
 SA)
 Similar to wounding, we also determined that bnl is expressed in subsets of CCs and PMs but not in LMs 48h post infestation (PI) of bnl-lexA; lexAOp-mCherry larvae (Fig
 6D, D)
 The fraction of Bnl+ CCs (as determined by mCherry+ Hindsight/Hnt+ cells [Hnt/Peb marks CCs]) was very low (~
1% +
97 standard deviation [SD]; n=20) when compared to the total number of CCs
 Next, we examined the expression of btl in hemocytes using btlGAL4; UAS-nls-GFP::lacZ, msn-mCherry, where msn-(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    mCherry marks LMs following wasp infestation (Tokusumi et al, )
 Confocal imaging at the vicinity of melanized wasp eggs in larvae revealed that a fraction of Btl+ LMs were detected near the melanized region, presumably encapsulating the wasp eggs (Fig
 E-E)
 Similar to the low fraction of Bnl+ CCs, the fraction of Btl+ LMs (as determined by GFP+ msn+ cells) was ~35% (+
61 SD, n=5) compared to the total LMs per field of view (Fig
 SE-E)
 In summary, these results confirm that both bnl and btl are expressed in rare subsets of  To characterize the role of bnl and btl in hemocytes, we used the wasp inf
 model and knocked down bnl in most hemocytes using HmlGAL
 Wasps were allowed to infest second instar HmlGAL4>control or HmlGAL4>bnl-RNAi (bnl-i) larvae
 48h PI, ~90% of control larvae (111/124) displayed melanotic nodules, which reflect the melanized wasp eggs
 In stark contrast, the melanization frequency dropped to <10% (12/128) in bnl-i larvae (Fig
 6H), suggesting a defect in melanization
 While CC numbers were surprisingly unaltered, the number of all blood cells (DAPI+ nuclei), Hml+ PMs, and LMs was significantly decreased (Fig
 SF-I)
 On the other hand, total blood cell number including Hml+ PMs, and CCs remained unaltered in uninfested control larvae (Fig
 SF-I)
 Next, to address the role of bnl specifically in CCs, we used LzGAL4 to drive RNAi against bnl
 Similar to the results obtained with HmlGAL4, over 80% of control larvae (84/99) showed melanized wasp eggs but the melanization frequency dropped to ~20% (31/166) in LzGAL4>bnl-i larvae (Fig
 6F, H), possibly due to the decline in the total blood cell number (Fig
 6I, J; SJ-M)
 However, the number of CCs remained unchanged and interestingly, while the total number of blood cells and Pxn+ hemocytes remained unchanged, CC numbers showed a mild reduction (Fig
 SJ-M)
 These results suggest that bnl, derived from CCs, and perhaps a subset of PMs, play a key role in the differentiation and possibly  To address the functions of Btl in vivo, we expressed RNAi against btl (btl-i) using Hml Lineage Tracing (HLT)-GAL4 to maintain GAL4 expression in hemocytes even upon loss of Hml expression (HmlGAL4; UAS-FLP; ubi-FRT-STOP-FRT-GAL)
 After wasp infestation, HLT-GAL4>btl-i larvae showed a 67% (74/109) reduction in the melanization frequency compared to that of 83% in controls (93/111) (Fig
 H)
 This subtle decline in melanization may be due, in part, to the loss of expression of Hml in terminally differentiated LMs and/or possible inefficient flippase activity in Hml+ PMs
 Thus, we used the pan-hemocyte driver SrpGAL
 Srp is well expressed in all blood cells including LMs (Fig
 S1G) and as expected, SrpGAL4-mediated knockdown of btl revealed a robust decline of ~20% (31/145) in melanization frequency of 48h post-wasp infested larvae compared to >85% (71/82) in control larvae (Fig
 6G, H)
 Similar to bnl-i in CCs, knockdown of btl resulted in a significant reduction in the number of LMs (Fig
 6K, L; S6Q) with a subtle decrease in the total number of blood cells but unchanged CC numbers (Fig
 S6N-P) compared to controls
 Moreover, none of the cell types, including CCs, displayed any changes in their numbers in uninfested control or btl-i larvae (Fig
 SN-P)
 These data suggest that Btl is critical for the differentiation and possible migration of LMs to elicit an efficient immune response upon wasp infestation
 Thus, communication between Bnl+ CCs and Btl+ LMs may be important in (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Previous studies have identified three major Drosophila blood cell types essential for combating infections in this species (Banerjee et al, 2019; Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007; Rizki, )
 Here, we used scRNA-seq of larval fly blood to gain deeper insights into the different cell types and their transition states in circulation during normal and inflammatory conditions
 Our comprehensive scRNA-seq data provide information on subpopulations of PMs and their immune-activated states
 Importantly, our scRNA-seq could precisely distinguish mature CCs and LMs from their respective intermediate states, which are less well understood and for which marker genes were not previously available
 Thus, new marker genes identified in this study should facilitate further study of these states
 Further, we were able to identify the gene signature of self-renewing PMs and suggest their role as extra-lymph gland oligopotent precursors (Fig
 J)
 In addition to the identification of various states of mature cell types, our study also suggests novel roles for a number of genes and pathways in blood cell biology
 In particular, we identified a putative new Mtk-like AMP and proposed a role for the FGF signaling pathway in mediating key events leading to the melanization of wasp eggs (Fig
 SR)
 Finally, we developed a user-friendly searchable online data mining resource that allows users to query, visualize, and compare genes within the diverse hemocyte populations across conditions (Fig
 SA)
 Towards a fly blood cell atlas  defining cell types and states Blood cell types are dynamic in nature and several transiting intermediate states exist in a continuum during the course of their maturation in several species
 Our scRNA-seq analysis provides a framework to distinguish cell types from their various states including oligopotent, transiting intermediate, and activated Oligopotent state: Our scRNA-seq analysis identified PM2 as the oligopotent state of PMs based on the enrichment of several cell cycle genes including polo and stg
 This signature suggests that PM2 corresponds to self-renewing PMs located in the circulatory and sessile compartments of the Drosophila hematopoietic system where PMs are the only dividing cells identified (Leito and Sucena, 2015; Makhijani et al, 2011; Rizki, )
 Further, previous studies suggested that LMs derived from embryonic-lineage hemocytes are readily detectable in circulation prior to their release from the lymph gland (Mrkus et al, 2009), and that terminally differentiated CCs can also derive from preexisting PMs in the sessile hub (Leito and Sucena, )
 Hence, we propose that PM2 corresponds to the oligopotent state that not only drives expansion of PMs, but importantly can also give rise to CCs and LMs
 Our Monocle3 analysis indicates that cell cycle genes decrease over pseudotime and there is ample evidence in support of the notion that cell cycle arrest may be required for terminal differentiation of various cell types in vertebrates (Ruijtenberg and van den Heuvel, 2016; Soufi and Dalton, )
 Our in vivo data also indicates that cell cycle arrest can lead to the generation of terminally differentiated LMs
 Interestingly, recent evidence in hemocytes suggests that perturbing cell cycle by knocking down jumu, which is upstream of polo, can also lead to the generation of LMs by activating Toll (Ahmad et al, 2012; Hao and Jin, 2017; Hao et al, )
 In contrast, forced expression of certain oncogenes such as activated Ras and Hopscotch/JAK in hemocytes can also lead to overproduction of PMs and LMs (Arefin et al, (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    2017; Asha et al, 2003; Luo et al, )
 It is, however, speculated that the proliferation and differentiation of hemocytes in these contexts may be linked to cell cycle (Asha et al, )
 Thus, it is important to address this paradoxical role of cell cycle in the maintenance of oligopotency and transdifferentiation of PMs
 Studies using lineage tracing methods such as G-TRACE (Evans et al, 2009) or CRISPR-based in vivo cellular barcoding techniques (Kebschull and Zador, 2018; Spanjaard et al, 2018) may help further characterize the contribution Immune-activated states: PM5 from our scRNA-seq data is enriched in several metabolic genes including gapdh2 and lactate dehydrogenase/Ldh, strongly suggesting that PM5 is metabolically active
 It is known that hemocytes can elevate their rates of aerobic glycolysis and increase the levels of Ldh to mount an effective immune response against pathogenic bacteria and wasp eggs (Bajgar et al, 2015; Krejov et al, )
 Additionally, genes of the glutathione S-transferase family of metabolic enzymes, which are known to catalyze the conjugation of reduced glutathione (GSH) to xenobiotics for their ultimate degradation, are enriched in this state (Fig
 SE)
 It has been demonstrated that a subset of hemocytes accumulate high GSH levels in Drosophila (Tirouvanziam et al, 2004), in support of our data
 Further, we classified the two AMP clusters PM6-7 (PMAMP) as part of the immune-activated states of PMs
 A recent study has demonstrated that AMPs are highly specific and act in synergy against various pathogens (Hanson et al, )
 Our scRNA-seq analysis reveals the remarkable difference in the expression of a set of AMPs in the two clusters
 Future studies with PMAMP-specific perturbation of various AMPs identified within PMs should clarify their contribution in killing specific pathogens
 Moreover, the role of Mtkl against pathogens needs further characterization
 Our pseudotime analysis showed that PMAMP ends in the same lineage as LMs suggesting a common mode of activation for these cell types and states
 Interestingly, induction in hemocytes of Toll, which is upstream of Drs, can lead to the production of LMs (Hao et al, 2018; Schmid et al, 2014), suggesting that LMint cells may act as the common branch point between immune-activated states and LMs
  Transiting intermediate states: The transcriptomic composition of CC1 and LM1 clusters suggested the presence of intermediates for CCs and LMs, respectively
 Further analysis by Monocle3, which placed these clusters prior to their terminally differentiated cell types, confirmed our hypothesis that CC1 and LM1 correspond to CCint and LMint states, respectively
 In the context of the CC lineage within the lymph gland, ultrastructural studies have revealed the presence of immature CCs, called procrystal cells (PCs), alongside mature CCs (Shrestha and Gateff, )
 We furthered this observation by demonstrating in vivo that CCs exist in a continuum (PPO1low to PPO1high), validating our Monocle3 and scRNA-seq data
 Moreover, clear gene signatures between the CCint and LMint states and their mature counterparts revealed that these intermediates most likely emerge from preexisting Hml+ PMs
 With regards to the LM lineage, several groups have speculated that intermediates, called podocytes, or also lamelloblasts, may exist based on cell morphology and size (Anderl et al, 2016, 2016; Brantley et al, 2018; Rizki, 1957, )
 Our scRNA-seq and Monocle3-based data clearly demarcate mature LMs from LMint at the transcriptomic level
 In addition, our sub-clustering analysis revealed that LMint possessed a PM signature demonstrating that these intermediates are (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    A novel role for the FGF signaling pathway in hemocyte crosstalk  In addition to the known hemocyte  tissue crosstalk (Shia et al, 2009), Drosophila hemocytes must act in a coordinated fashion to combat harmful pathogens and foreign entities such as wasp eggs (Banerjee et al, 2019; Lemaitre and Hoffmann, )
 However, the signaling pathways that mediate the interactions among hemocytes and wound sites or wasp eggs have been unclear
 Our scRNA-seq uncovered a novel role for the FGF signaling pathway in controlling hemocyte differentiation and subsequent effects on the melanization of wasp eggs
 The FGF ligand bnl and its receptor btl were among the genes identified in rare subsets of CCs and LMs, respectively, highlighting the power of scRNA-seq in capturing and detecting these small populations of cells
 Based on our in vivo data, we propose that Bnl+ CCs interact with Btl+ LMs to coordinate LM differentiation and possible migration towards parasitoid wasp eggs (Fig

 Phalloidin (ThermoFischer A34055) was used at a concentration of :
 Hindsight (Hnt; 1:10 dilution) antibody was obtained from DSHB
 Wounding: Precisely timed 24h (hours) after egg lay (AEL) larvae of the hml>EGFP genotype were collected and grown on normal fly food until they reached 96h AEL for wounding procedure
 At 96h AEL, larvae were either left unwounded (Unw) or wounded with a clean tungsten needle (Fine Science Tools, cat# -)
 Ten larvae at a time were wounded at their posterior dorsal side and returned back to fly food with a total of at least 80 wounded larvae per vial 24h later, the Unw control and wounded larvae were retrieved from fly food Wasp Infestation: OreR larvae were infested at 72h AEL with the wasps of the species Leptopilina boulardi
 Wasps were removed after 12 hours of co-culture and egg deposition was confirmed by direct observation of wasp eggs in the hemolymph during dissection
 100 larvae were dissected at 96 and 120h AEL, corresponding to 24 and 48h post infestation (wasp inf
 24h and 48h), respectively, in Schneider's medium (Gibco, cat# To get most of the sessile hemocytes into circulation, washed larvae were transferred to 2 ml Eppendorf tubes containing ~
5 ml of glass beads (Sigma #9268, size: 425-600 m) in PBS and larvae were vortexed for 2 min as previously described with minor modifications (Petraki et al, )
 One set each of Unw and wounded larvae were vortexed in separate tubes at a time
 After the brief vortex, larvae were retrieved, washed and transferred to 200 l of ice-cold PBS in each well of a clean 9-well glass dish per condition
 ~100 larvae were bled by gently nicking open the posterior side of each larva using a pair of clean tweezers
 Larvae were allowed to bleed for at least a minute and the hemolymph in PBS was filtered through 100 m cell strainer and the filtered hemolymph was overlaid onto 2 ml of 
09 g/ml Optiprep gradient solution (Axis-Shield cat# AXS-1114542) and spun at 2000 rpm for 30 min at 4oC to eliminate dead cells and debris
 After centrifugation, ~150 l of the hemolymph was transferred to clean low bind Eppendorf tubes and counted using a hemocytometer
 High quality single hemocytes were subjected to encapsulation either by inDrops or 10X Genomics v2 Hemocytes from wasp infested larvae were isolated with some modifications, where the optiprep step was avoided to obtain higher number of cells
 Briefly, after vortexing, the larvae were bled in ice cold Schneiders medium, filtered through 100 m cell strainer, and transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube
 Next, the cells were spun at 4oC for 5 min at 6000 rpm
 The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were re-suspended in ice cold PBS to achieve a concentration of 300 cells/l and subjected to Drop-seq based encapsulation

 ;    Single hemocytes from Unw control and wounded larvae, respectively, were encapsulated either by inDrops or For inDrops, hemocytes were encapsulated at the Single Cell Core facility of the ICCB-Longwood Screening Facility at Harvard Medical School ( using the inDrops v3 library format (Klein et al, )
 Reverse transcription and library preparation were performed at the same facility
 The libraries were made following a previously described protocol (Klein et al, 2015; Zilionis et al, 2017), with the R1-N6 primer sequence [step 151 in the library prep protocol (Zilionis et al, 2017)]: PCR primer sequences (steps 157 and 160 in the library prep protocol in (Zilionis et al, 2017):  With these modifications in the primer sequences, custom sequencing primers are no longer required
 The fragment size of each library was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer high sensitivity chip
 Libraries were diluted to 
5 nM and then quantified by qPCR using primers against the p5-p7 sequence
 inDrops libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Nextseq 500 with following parameters: (1) Read 1: 61 cycles, (2) i7 index: 8 cycles index 1, (3) i5 index: 8 cycles (i5), and (4) Read 2: 14 cycles
 Binary base call (BCL) files were converted into FASTQ format with bcl2fastq, using the following flags that are required for inDrops v3: (1) --use-bases-mask With regards to 10X genomics, cells were encapsulated according to the manufacturers protocol
 cDNA libraries generated by both platforms were sequenced after pooling four different (indexed) samples per one 400M plus NextSeq500 cartridge with following parameters: (1) Read 1: 26 cycles, (2) i7 index: 8 cycles, (3) i5 The protocol for Drop-seq based encapsulation was followed as previously described (Macosko et al, )

  inDrops: Gene-level counts were imported to R using the bcbioSingleCell 
 
15 package container class, which is optimized for scRNA-seq (Huber et al, )
 SingleCellExperiment: S4 Classes for analysis was performed using this package, and the `filterCells()` function was used to filter out low quality cells by keeping cellular barcodes with the following metrics: (1) >= 100 UMIs per cell; (2) >= 100 genes per cell; (3) >= 
85 novelty score, calculated as log10(genes detected) / log10(UMI counts per cell)
 Additionally, genes with very low expression across the data set were filtered by applying a cutoff of >= 10 cells per gene
 One sample, blood3_TCGCATAA (Table S1), was filtered at a higher threshold of 650 genes per cell, which was required to subset the input cellular barcodes into the expected biological range based on the inDrops 10X genomics: QC was performed by keeping cells with the following metrics: (1) >= 500 UMIs per cell; (2) >= 200 genes per cell; (3) <= 30 percentage of mitochondria genes

 ;    DropSeq: Cumulative distribution of reads from the aligned bam files were obtained using BAMTagHistogram from the Drop-seq tools package
 The number of cells were inferred from the sharp decrease in the slope
 The inferred cell number was determined as a minimal threshold number of aligned reads per cell for cell selection
  In our QC pipeline, we did not regress out cell cycle genes during clustering for two reasons: 
 Cell cycle genes did not contribute to the variation for downstream clustering, and 
 We expected cycling PMs to be an important aspect in our analysis
 Hence, cell cycle parameters were retained throughout clustering process
 Data integration: For combined analysis of all samples, the quality filtered datasets were merged using the common genes into a single Seurat (version 
1) object (Stuart et al, 2019) and integrated using Harmony (Korsunsky et al, )
 The gene symbols from inDrops, 10X, and Drop-seq were converted to the same version by using FlyBase online ID Converter tool (FB2019_03) (Thurmond et al, )
 Genes expressed in at least two out of three conditions were retained when combining datasets from different technologies, to minimize loss of genes, as Harmony uses common genes across all conditions
 We ran PCA using the expression matrix of the top 2000 most variable genes
 The total number of principal components (PCs) to compute and store were 
 Theta values were set c(2, 10) for condition and technology
 A resolution of 
4 was chosen as clustering parameter
 The t-SNE was then performed using default parameters to visualize data Merging of clusters: At 
4 resolution, 20 clusters were obtained and three clusters (1, 14, and 19) shared similar gene expression with that of cluster 
 Hence, we merged clusters 1, 14, and 19 into 0 (see Fig
 SF)
 Sub-clustering: CC sub-clustering and LM sub-clustering follow the same procedure but with different parameters
 For CC sub-clustering we used theta=c(2, 5) for condition and technology and clustering resolution of 
 
 For LM sub-clustering we used theta=c(3, 8) for condition and technology and clustering Gene expression visualization by Dot plots: Dot plots were generated using Seurat DotPlot function

5K cells from the wounding data set (10X platform; n=2) were analyzed by Monocle3 ( (Cao et al, )
 The input data set was pre-processed by using num_dim equal 
 Then the data was applied by align_cds function to remove the batch effect
 The cell trajectory was calculated by using learn_graph function and ncenter equal 
 Three lineages were selected by using choose_graph_segments function

 We then assigned the start point, which coincidentally also overlapped with the high expression of Hml around the same start point
  The original FASTQ files, UMI-disambiguated counts in MatrixMarket Exchange format (MTX files) [see  for details], and inDrops v3 sample barcodes used will be available on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO submission in progress)
 The code used to perform clustering and We performed gene set enrichment analysis on marker genes with positive fold change for each cluster using a program written in-house
 Gene sets for major functional groups were collected from the GLAD database (Hu et al, 2015), and gene sets for metabolic pathways were from the KEGG database (Kanehisa et al, 2017) and Reactome database (McKay and Weiser, )
  P-value enrichment was calculated based on the hypergeometric distribution
 The strength of enrichment was calculated as negative of log10(p-value), which is Whole larval imaging: Third instar lzGAL4>GFP; BcF6-mCherry larvae were heat killed in glycerol on a glass slide and directly mounted onto coverslip-bottom imaging dishes (ibidi, cat# )
 The posterior hemocyte hubs were imaged with Z stacks of 2 m distance each encompassing the entire area of the hub in a lateral direction using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope
 Finally, all the stacks per larva were merged by summing the intensities on Fiji software for subsequent intensity measurements of GFP and mCherry
  Wasp infested w;UAS-nlsGFP::lacZ;btlGAL4 larvae were imaged using Nikon C2 Si-plus confocal microscope
 Staining hemocytes from unwounded or wounded larvae: ~13 larvae per condition or genotype were vortexed and bled into 300 l of Schneiders insect media and then the cells were transferred to one well (per condition) of the chambered coverslip slides
 Hemocytes were allowed to settle down for 30 min, then were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min
 Next, the cells were washed three times with 1X PBS and permeabilized with 
1% PBST (PBS with 
1% Triton-X) for 10 min
 Subsequently, the cells were blocked with 5% BSA in PBST (blocking buffer) for 20 min and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies L1abc (1:100 dilution) overnight at oC
 The next day, cells were washed three times in PBST and incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution) for 1hr at room temperature
 Finally, the cells were washed (3X) and mounting media with DAPI was directly added onto the cells in the wells and imaged using Nikon Spinning disk (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

4% Triton X in 1xPBS and then incubated with a secondary antibody with 1% BSA/
4% Triton X in 1xPBS for 3 hours at room temperature
 After washing 3 times with 
4% Triton X in 1xPBS, samples were kept in Vectashield (Vector Laboratory) with DAPI and imaged by a Nikon C2 Si-plus confocal microscope
 Cell counting: Hemocytes were mounted and imaged by Nikon C2 Si-plus or Zeiss Axiocam 
 Captured image of hemocytes were quantified and analyzed by ImageJ (plug in: 3D object counter) or Imaris (Bitplane)
 Hemocytes bled from individual whole larvae were counted for this study
  Hemolymph with hemocytes was derived 24h after wounding along with their Unw control hml>EGFP larvae
 50~80 larvae per biological replicate were bled in 80 l of Schneiders insect media and the resulting hemolymph (~100 l) was transferred to RNase free Eppendorf tubes and frozen on dry ice
 In parallel, whole larvae (4 larvae per biological replicate) were directly transferred to the Eppendorf tubes and frozen on dry ice
 For RNA isolation from hemocytes, 1 ml of Trizol was added to each sample and incubated for 5 min before adding 
2 ml of chloroform for subsequent phase separation
 The tubes were spun for 15 min at 12k rpm at oC
 The aqueous phase was carefully retrieved and transferred to a fresh tube and equal volumes of absolute ethanol was added
 For better precipitation of RNA, 1 l of ultrapure glycogen (1mg/ml) was added to the tubes and incubated at -20oC overnight
 Later, the tubes were spun down at 12K rpm for 15 min at 4oC and the resultant pellet was washed in 70% ethanol, air dried, and subjected to DNase treatment using the manufacturers instructions of Turbo DNA free (cat# AM)
 The DNA free RNA was further purified using Zymo Direct-zol RNA MicroPrep kit (cat# R)
 The resultant pure RNA was reverse transcribed using BioRad iScript cDNA synthesis kit and SyBr green based qRT-PCR was performed to determine the expression levels of AMP genes
 For total RNA isolation from whole larvae, the above protocol was followed except no overnight precipitation method was used and that the larvae were homogenized using RNase-free All statistics with regards to intensity measurements, cell counts, and qRT-PCR, were performed on Prism 8 software
