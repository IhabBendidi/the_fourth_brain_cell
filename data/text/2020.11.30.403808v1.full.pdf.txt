 One hypothesis for this no-reperfusion 14 phenomenon is micro-emboli fragmenting off the large clot during thrombectomy and occluding 15 smaller blood vessels downstream of the clot location
 This is impossible to observe in-vivo and so we 16 here develop an in-silico model based on in-vitro experiments to model the effect of micro-emboli on 17 brain tissue
 Through in-vitro experiments we obtain, under a variety of clot consistencies and 18 microcirculation is modelled for statistically accurate voxels of brain microvasculature including 20 penetrating arterioles and capillary beds
 A novel micro-emboli algorithm, informed by the 21 experimental data, is used to simulate the impact of micro-emboli successively entering the penetrating 22 arterioles and the capillary bed

 ;    coefficients  are calculated under various conditions
 We find that capillary beds are more susceptible 24 to occlusions than the penetrating arterioles with a 4x greater drop in permeability per volume of vessel 25 occluded
 Individual microvascular geometries determine robustness to micro-emboli
 Hard clot 26 fragmentation leads to larger micro-emboli and larger drops in blood flow for a given number of micro-27 emboli
 Thrombectomy technique has a large impact on clot fragmentation and hence occlusions in the 28 microvasculature
 As such, in-silico modelling of mechanical thrombectomy predicts that clot specific 29 factors, interventional technique, and microvascular geometry strongly influence reperfusion of the 30 brain
 Micro-emboli are likely contributory to the phenomenon of no-reperfusion following successful 31 After an ischaemic stroke - one where a clot blocks a major artery in the brain - patients can undergo a 34 procedure where the clot is removed mechanically with a stent - a thrombectomy
 This reopens the 35 blocked vessel, yet some patients dont achieve blood flow returning to their tissue downstream
 One 36 hypothesis for this phenomenon is that the clot fragments into smaller clots (called micro-emboli) which 37 block smaller vessels downstream
 However, this cant be measured in patients due to the inability of 38 clinical imaging resolving the micro-scale
 We therefore develop a computational model here, based on 39 experimental thrombectomy data, to quantify the impact of micro-emboli on blood flow in the brain 40 after the removal of a clot
 With this model, we found that micro-emboli are a likely contributor to the 41 no-reflow phenomenon after a thrombectomy
 Individual blood vessel geometries, clot composition, 42 and thrombectomy technique all impacted the effect of micro-emboli on blood flow and should be taken 43 into consideration to minimise the impact of micro-emboli in the brain
 Furthermore, the computational 44 model developed here allows us to now build large-scale models of blood flow in the brain, and hence 45 simulate stroke and the impact of micro-emboli on the entire brain

 ;    Stroke is the second largest cause of mortality and of adult disability globally []
 Ischaemic stroke  48 the physical occlusion of a cerebral artery by a blood clot (embolus) restricting blood supply to a part 49 of the brain  is the most common form of stroke, occurring in approximately 85% of strokes []
 Time 50 is critical in stroke, with every hour of delay without treatment causing a loss of neurons equivalent to 51 3-4 years of ageing [2] and a 6% reduction in positive outcome once the patient is treated []
 52 Since 2015, the use of intra-arterial thrombectomy  the mechanical removal of a clot via a stent  has 53 become the standard of care for patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion 54 [,]
 Despite this, many patients do not recover full perfusion in their tissue downstream of the 55 recanalized vessel []
 This observation, commonly known as the no-reflow or no-reperfusion 56 phenomenon, has been documented in numerous studies involving both animals and humans []
 57 Hypotheses for this phenomenon include: changes in the ultrastructure of the microvasculature and 58 spontaneous blood clotting [7], capillary stalling and leukocyte adhesion [10,1315], breakdown of the 59 blood-brain barrier leading to tissue swelling and vessel collapse [12,16,17], vasoconstriction of the 60 capillary vessels due to pericyte death [10,18,19], oxidative stress and inflammatory responses [11], 61 and micro-emboli fragments post-recanalization blocking micro-vessels downstream of the clot [,]
 62 One of the above hypotheses for the no-reflow phenomenon  a micro-emboli shower fragmenting 63 off the clot  is of interest due to the clear clinical treatment pathway via thrombolysis
 There is indirect 64 evidence that micro-emboli can fragment off clots and lead to worse patient outcomes
 Patients who 65 undergo endarterectomy (surgical removal of a plaque in the vasculature) with stenting in the carotid 66 artery are 3 times as likely to have lesions appear in diffusion weighted MRI scans, and have non-67 disabling strokes, than those who only had an endarterectomy []
 There is therefore a potential link 68 between clot fragmentation and the potential for microvascular occlusions and worse patient outcomes
 69  As part of the INSIST (IN-silico clinical trials for treatment of acute Ischaemic STroke) consortium 70 (www

eu) we are developing full brain models of blood flow and oxygen transport in 71  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30, 
 ;    health, after an ischaemic stroke, and post-thrombectomy/thrombolysis []
 The goal of INSIST is to 72 advance in-silico clinical stroke trials for biomedical products for the treatment of ischaemic stroke
 As 73 such, an accurate model of clot fragmentation during thrombectomy is required to simulate the effect 74 of micro-emboli on reperfusion post-recanalization
 This will help in deducing whether micro-emboli 75 Due to the intrinsically microvascular nature of the no-reflow phenomenon, it is impossible to assess 77 the impact of micro-emboli showers in humans, with most microinfarcts being < 1 mm in size making 78 in-vivo detection of them challenging []
 However, silicone in-vitro models of human cerebral 79 vasculatures have been used to quantify how a clot fragments during thrombectomy using a range of 80 removal techniques and different clot consistencies [,]
 Most other experimental works analysing 81 the impact of occlusions on the microvasculature come from mouse models []
 Recently, an in-82 silico study on a mouse cortex microvascular network found that the severity of micro-strokes in the 83 capillary bed were heavily influenced by the local network topology, with decreases in flow of up to 84 On the macro-scale, full organ models of blood flow in the brain have been developed [,]
 These 86 models treat the microvasculature in the brain as a continuous porous medium, effectively smoothing 87 out the local topology and variations in blood flow
 Crucially, these models are parameterized by 88 simulations of blood flow in the microvasculature []
 As such, in order to achieve the aim of 89 simulating a micro-emboli shower in the microvasculature and to determine its effect on the large-scale 90 blood flow, a multi-scale model of micro-occlusions will be developed here
 This model will link the 91 blood flow in the microvasculature to the parameters used to model full brain blood flow and the effect 92 of thrombectomy on the microcirculation, both at the penetrating vessel scale and the capillary scale
 93 To the best of our knowledge no models of micro-emboli occlusions have been developed for post-94 This paper then seeks to answer, through modelling informed by in-vitro experiments, the following 96 questions: To what extent is clot fragmentation responsible for the post-thrombectomy no-reflow 97  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30, 
 ;    phenomenon? Can the changes in the blood flow modelling parameters due to micro-emboli showers 98 be accurately quantified such that they can be used in the full organ models? What impact do 99 thrombectomy technique and clot consistency have on downstream blood flow post-thrombectomy? 100 In order to investigate the effects of micro-emboli on the cerebral microvasculature, a modelling 103 framework must first be developed
 There are two main ways in which the cerebral microvasculature 104 can be modelled  either as a network of individual vessels [3537], or as an averaged porous medium 105 [,,,]
 We model the microvasculature as a porous medium in order to allow large regions of 106 The microvasculature will be parameterised following on from previous research developed by our 108 group [,,]
 Firstly, statistical models are developed which match morphological properties of the 109 human cerebrovascular network []
 The microvasculature is then split into 2 different spatial 110 scales  the capillary bed, and the penetrating arterioles
 In order to scale up the microvasculature to 111 larger regions, the capillary bed blood flow is parameterised with a permeability, as are the penetrating 112 arterioles
 The flow from the penetrating arterioles to the capillary bed is parameterised through 113 coupling coefficients  which represent the conductance of the pre-capillary arterioles
 The 114 parameterisation method is explained in Section 
 
 Example networks of the different microvascular 115 scales and their coupling can be seen in Fig

 The grey region represents the homogenized 119 capillary bed to which the terminal vessels of the trees couple
 The red planes denote the dividing 120 planes between the 6 layers of the voxel over which the blood flow characteristics will be 121 Previous in-vitro studies generated micro-emboli distributions from thrombectomy procedures
 In brief, 124 a silicone cerebrovascular model built from clinical imaging data was used in a flow loop with a 125 peristaltic pump to simulate blood flow through the cerebral vasculature [,]
 A thrombus was 126 injected into the cerbrovascular replica to form a middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion
 The thrombus 127 was either defined as a soft or hard clot, and validated for bulk mechanical properties based on clinical 128 specimens []
 Four different clot removal techniques (thrombectomy) were then deployed to remove 129 the clot from the MCA
 Specifics on the 4 thrombectomy techniques  abbreviated as ADAPT, 130 Solumbra, BGC, and GC at cervical ICA  can be found in Chueh et al []
 The number and size 131 distribution of the clot fragments that break off the thrombus during thrombectomy are quantified using 132 a Coulter counter (Beckman Multisizer 4, Brea, California)
 Each removal technique is repeated 8 times 133 for each clot type, resulting in 64 sets of clot fragment data

 ;    When sampling from this data for our in-silico models the 8 experimental micro-emboli density 135 distributions (for a given removal technique and clot type) are averaged such that for any given 136 technique and clot type there is only one average set of micro-emboli results relating number density 137 and particle size
 The smallest clot measurable, due to the aperture used in the Coulter counter, was 138 
034 m in diameter, with smaller clots binned under this size
 139 Prior work has shown how blood flow can be simulated in a coupled model of the penetrating vessels 141 and a porous representation of the capillary bed []
 This model is adapted here such that it can be 142 used to determine the permeability of the penetrating arterioles in health and with micro-emboli 143 An example voxel, where the penetrating arterioles are coupled to the capillary bed, is shown in Fig b
 145 Flow through the penetrating vessels is assumed to be steady-state, non-pulsatile (Womersley number 146 << 1) and fully developed, hence approximated by Poiseuille flow: 147 where  is the blood flow through the vessel,  is the radius of the vessel,  is the pressure drop across 149 that vessel,  is the length of the vessel, and () is the apparent viscosity of blood in the vessel 150 correcting for the Fhrus-Lindqvist effect with a constant discharge haematocrit of 
45 []
 151 As flow is conserved at each bifurcation node , the net flow at each node in the tree is zero except for 152 the one inlet node and the multiple terminal nodes that end in the capillary bed
 Therefore, the flow 153 through each internal node for  nodes can be written as: 154  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30, 
 ;    where  is the flow conductance between nodes  and  and is defined as conductance is zero unless there is a vessel between nodes  and 
   and  are the pressures at nodes 157  and  respectively
 The inlet flow and terminal flows are handled by the boundary conditions at the 158 inlet to the arteriole and at the coupling points to the capillary bed
 This set of  equations can be written 159 in matrix form and solved as in Su et al []
 160 The capillary bed can be modelled as a porous medium using a volume-averaged form of Darcys law 161 where  is the volume averaged capillary velocity,  is the permeability (as the permeability is 164 isotropic this can be treated as a scalar), and  is the pressure gradient across the capillary bed
 The 165 permeability  encapsulates the micro-scale geometry of the capillary bed in one averaged parameter, 166 hence allowing for large-scale regions to be modelled computationally efficiently
 This equation can be 167 where  is the volumetric source/sink term [m3 s-1 m-3] that comes from the terminal nodes of the 170 penetrating vessels
 The healthy capillary permeability value has previously been found be 
28x10-4 171 mm3 s-1 kg-1 []
 Equation (4) is the Poisson equation that can be solved for capillary pressure over an 172 The coupling between the penetrating vessel terminal nodes and the porous capillary bed has a 175 mathematical singularity at the point of coupling between 1D flow and 3D tissue
 Previous models have 176 approximated the Dirac delta singularity with a function that is spatially variant yet maintains mass 177 conservation [30]; have approximated the pressure drop in the vicinity of the coupling point to deal with 178 the strong pressure gradients that appear there [49]; or have simply taken the discretised element nearest 179  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30, 
 ;    the terminal node as the outlet region [,]
 Here, we use a spatially variant function to approximate 180 the volumetric source terms []
 A shape function is introduced that replaces the Dirac delta singularity 181 with an exponential in the vicinity of the source
 The shape function, , is defined as 182 where  is the distance measured from the source/sink node and  is the radius of the sphere over which 184 the flow will be distributed from the arteriole source to the capillary bed (here set as 15 m)
  is a 185 constant that acts to normalise  to ensure mass conservation across the capillary bed elements coupled 186 to the terminal tree node
 Therefore, the volumetric source term for each finite element within  radius 187 where  is the volumetric source term for one element within  radius of the terminal node and  is 190 the coordinate of the terminal node
 A summation is used to account for the potential that multiple 191 terminal nodes may feed an individual element
 As the shape function  conserves mass, () = 1 192 The voxel size chosen to simulate the flow is 2 x 2 x 
5 mm (on the order of an MRI voxel), with 8 195 arterioles /mm2 penetrating into the voxel []
 This voxel was situated in a capillary bed of 
25 x 
25 196 x 
5 mm to avoid terminal nodes being at the face of the voxel (Fig b)
 As the parameterisation of 197 micro-emboli occluding the penetrating arterioles was primarily of interest here, the venules were not 198 included in the simulation
 As well as this, the permeability of the capillary bed was chosen such that 199 the maximum possible flow could be obtained through the arterioles (in this case  was set to 
x5 mm3 s kg-)
 The arterioles have a mean diameter of 20 m  5 m, with a mean length of

 An inlet pressure of 
3 kPa is imposed at the tree inlets []
 Dirichlet boundary conditions 202 were imposed at the top and bottom of the voxel with  =

 204 The finite element method is used to simulate the capillary bed partial differential equation using 205 FEniCS, an open source finite element solver []
 Equation (4) is solved with the parameters and 206 boundary conditions using 870,000 linear Lagrangian elements to obtain the pressure in the capillary 207 bed
 The equations above were solved iteratively

 For all tree outlets coupled to capillary bed, determine elements in mesh coupled to the outlet 213 
 Set desired inlet pressures for penetrating vessels and set initial terminal outlet pressures = 0 215 
 Solve for the pressure in the trees using equations (1) and (2), hence solve for the outlet flows 216 from the trees into the capillary bed weighting the volumetric source terms using equations (5) 217

 ;    In order to simulate the effect of micro-emboli on the microvasculature, an algorithm is presented here 227 that samples from the in-vitro experimental thrombectomy data and occludes vessels sequentially
 The 228 A clot technique and clot consistency are chosen from one of our 8 clot distributions as described in 232 Section 
 
 The algorithm initially runs the healthy flow solver above to establish baseline healthy 233  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30, 
 ;    blood flow
 A clot size is then sampled pseudo-randomly using Pythons inbuilt random module from 234 A penetrating arteriole is randomly chosen on the pial surface through which the clot is sent through
 236 The clot is assumed to be perfectly spherical A check is then made to determine whether the clot is 237 larger than the diameter of the vessel it is entering
 If the clot is smaller than the vessel, the clot is 238 assumed to travel until the next bifurcation
 At the bifurcation, the clot enters one of the two daughter 239 branches based on a probability that is linearly weighted by the blood flow in the daughter branches
 240 For example, if one daughter vessel has 3 times as much flow as the other daughter vessel, the clot has 241 a 75% chance of going down the vessel with more flow
 242 The clot continues to travel through vessels if its diameter is smaller than the diameter of the vessel it 243 is entering
 If the clot enters a vessel with a smaller diameter, it is assumed that the clot completely 244 occludes that vessel
 When that occurs, it is assumed no blood can enter the occluded vessels or any 245 vessels downstream of the occluded vessel
 The algorithm recalculates a baseline blood flow and 246 If the clot reaches a terminal vessel, and it is still smaller than the vessel, it is assumed that the clot 248 generates no occlusions in the penetrating vessels and enters the capillary bed
 As we are trying to 249 quantify the damage done by micro-emboli to the penetrating vessels, we do not create capillary bed 250 occlusions in this simulation
 The effect of micro-emboli on the capillary bed is thus considered 251 separately in Section 
 
 As such, no vessels in the penetrating tree are occluded, and a new clot is 252 The algorithm described, shown in Fig 2, is repeated until only one penetrating vessel remains or until 254 50,000 clots have been sampled, whichever comes first
 The large number of maximum clots is chosen 255 such that we can ensure that all the vessels are eventually occluded, allowing us to track the damage 256  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30, 
 ;    There are 2 specific parameters of interest when attempting to model the penetrating vessels over a 259 large scale  the permeability and the coupling coefficients
 The permeability of the penetrating vessels 260 represents the ability of the trees to drive blood flow deeper into the grey cortex due to their 1-261 dimensional nature [54], and the coupling coefficients represent the pre-capillary arterioles ability to 262 deliver blood to the capillary bed
 These parameters are necessary to simulate large regions of the human 263 brain blood flow efficiently []
 However, these parameters also effectively average out the micro-264 scale fluctuations in the vasculature, replacing a complex network with one parameter
 This can be 265 problematic with the penetrating vessels when considering, for example, the terminal nodes of the trees
 266 It is highly unlikely they are distributed evenly through the grey matter with depth
 It is also highly 267 unlikely that the permeability of the trees is constant with depth through the voxel
 We mitigate this 268 problem by splitting the voxel into 6 layers, similar to other approaches [,]
 Permeabilities and 269 coupling coefficients are then calculated for each of the 6 layers through the voxel, increasing the 270 Permeability
 As the permeability of interest is defined as the ability of the penetrating vessels to 272 drive blood flow deeper into the cortex, it is calculated in the vertical direction only
 The angle that 273 every vessel makes with the vertical is calculated (situating the vertical at the vessel node where flow 274 enters the vessel)
 The vertically projected flow of the vessel, ,, is then calculated as 275 where  is the angle between the vessel and the vertical, and  is the absolute flow through the vessel
 277 The arterial blood flow, ,, through each of the six layers is then summed separately and the 278  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30, 
 ;    where  = , through layer , , is the arteriolar permeability in layer ,  is the cross-sectional 281 area through which the blood flows (in this case the area of the voxel), and  is the pressure gradient 282 across the layer
 Using this method provides 6 different estimates of arteriolar permeability at 6 different 283 Coupling coefficients
 The method to calculate the coupling coefficients can be found in Hyde et al 285 []
 The coupling coefficients can be thought of as a conductance (or 1/resistance) to flow from the 286 arteriolar compartment to the capillary compartment via the pre-capillary arterioles
 This can be written 287 where  is the coupling coefficient between the arteriolar and capillary compartments,  is the 290 volume averaged pressure of compartment , and  is the flow of the arterioles which terminate in the 291 where the bracket  term refers to the values in layer 
 The volume averaged flow in layer , (), can 294 be calculated using equation ()
 The volume averaged pressure of the arteriolar compartment () 295 where  is the average nodal pressure of vessel  in layer , and  is the volume of vessel  in layer 298 
 Six values of average pressure are calculated, one for each layer
 299 Finally, the volume averaged capillary pressure at each layer () is calculated by taking the volume 300 average of the pressures in the finite element mesh of the capillary bed
 This allows for the permeability 301 and coupling coefficients of the penetrating vessels to be fully characterised
 In order to be able to 302 characterise the variable permeabilities and coupling coefficients calculated above, a polynomial least 303  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30, 
 ;    squares fit is used to derive a function of how these coefficients vary with depth which is then fitted 304 over the 100 simulations conducted on the statistically accurate voxels
 305 Based on the pipeline previously presented, we now seek to investigate whether the different micro-308 emboli distributions from thrombectomy have an impact on the permeability (and hence perfusion) of 309 the penetrating arterioles following the introduction of micro-emboli
 The micro-emboli algorithm is 310 therefore used to simulate an emboli shower for 8 different scenarios  4 techniques used on hard or 311 As well as this, we investigate the impact that differing microvasculatures have on the resulting drops 313 in permeability and coupling coefficients
 Each of the 100 statistically accurate voxels can be thought 314 of as an individual microvasculature
 We randomly choose 3 of these voxels and, for each voxel, we 315 simulate 100 different sampled clot distributions entering the penetrating vessels
 These simulations are 316 compared to another simulation where we take our 100 voxels and run the same sampled clot 317 distribution through each voxel  this is done for 3 different sampled clot distributions
 The question 318 that we seek to answer is whether it is the microvasculature or the clot distributions that primarily 319 determine microvascular robustness to drops in perfusion
 Differences between distributions are 320 quantified using the correlation matrix distance (CMD) on the covariance matrices of each distribution 321 Finally, the effect of micro-emboli on capillary beds is considered
 Previously, we demonstrated how 324 statistically accurate models of capillary beds can be homogenized into a porous medium []
 This 325 method is combined here with a vessel occlusion algorithm to simulate the effect of micro-emboli 326 entering the capillary bed
 The decrease in permeability as a function of the vessel fraction lost, surface 327  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30, 
 ;    area fraction lost, and volume fraction lost are all quantified
 This allows for the scaling up of partially 328 Details of the blood flow simulation and homogenization of the capillary bed can be found in El-Bouri 330 & Payne []
 In brief, Poiseuille flow is assumed through the capillary vessels, with the capillary 331 network being periodic
 A pressure gradient is imposed in one direction and the permeability  the ratio 332 of the volume-averaged flow and the pressure gradient  is calculated
 This is repeated for the 3 333 principal directions of the capillary network
 The result is a 3x3 tensor, with 3 principal permeabilities 334 (the permeability in the direction of the pressure gradient) and 6 cross-permeabilities
 335 As the smallest measurable clot was 
034 m, and the average diameter of a capillary is 
23  
3 m 336 [40], the micro-emboli algorithm above could not be used on the networks as they would always occlude 337 the inlet vessel
 As such, a random vessel was chosen in the network and this vessel was fully occluded, 338 with the permeability being recalculated after every occlusion
 Three cube sizes were used to simulate 339 the micro-occlusions with lengths of 375, 500, and 625 m
 Normalised permeability changes are 340 calculated, and the effect of the micro-emboli on the capillary bed is quantified such that it can be used 341 in full-brain simulations
 Constrained least squares optimization is used to fit a line of best fit with the 342 where  is the permeability fraction,  is the change in either vessel fraction, volume fraction, or 345 surface area fraction of the networks, and  is the gradient
 All parameters calculated for the capillary 346 bed are based on 500 statistically accurate capillary networks at each cube size (1500 total)

 ;    Blood flow was simulated in 100 statistically accurate voxels of the cerebral microvasculature
 The 350 permeability and coupling coefficients were quantified for the penetrating arterioles in the no-351 occlusion scenario
 The permeability results are shown in Fig

 The mean arteriolar permeability 355 is indicated with a red star at each layer
 b) A quadratic line of best fit over the median 356 permeabilities at each layer  error bars are interquartile ranges 357 The permeability increases with depth until the middle layers before dropping off towards the bottom 358 layers, as not all penetrating vessels penetrate the full depth of the grey matter (Fig a)
 The mean value 359 of the permeability across the layers is approximately 50 times the capillary permeability
 At each layer 360 the average permeability ranges from around 30x at the top layer, to 75x in layer 3, to 9x at the bottom 361 layer
 A quadratic curve fit is used to derive a function that models arteriolar permeability with depth, 362 such that it can be used in future porous model implementations (Fig b)
 The permeability distribution 363 at each layer can also be characterised as log-normal (Shapiro-Wilks test,  = 
05) up to and including 364  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30, 
 ;    The coupling coefficients demonstrate a similar drop from the top layers to the bottom layers, driven 366 by the fact that there are fewer terminal nodes at the bottom layers []
 The variability in the coupling 367 coefficients from voxel-to-voxel is larger than the permeability variability (S1 Fig)
 The median values 368 of the coupling coefficients are 
8x10-5, 
4x10-5, 
3x10-5, 
7x10-5, 
1x10-5, and 
3x10-6 Pa-1 s-1 369 (from layers 1  )

 More importantly, however, these healthy results provide a baseline from which the effect 375 
2 The arterioles are robust to micro-emboli at the population level 377 As there are 4 thrombectomy techniques used with 2 clot consistencies to give 8 different micro-emboli 378 distributions to choose from, a baseline must be chosen to conduct the following simulations
 Here we 379 choose the ADAPT technique with a hard clot to present the following results
 A comparison with other 380 techniques and clot consistencies can be found in Sections 
4, 
 
 381 The variable of interest here is the fractional drop in permeability
 This is defined as the permeability 382 divided by the initial healthy permeability
 We compare this independent variable against 3 dependent 383 variables  the fraction of vessels occluded, the fraction of vessel surface area occluded, and the fraction 384 of vessel volume occluded
 The surface area and volume drops have been calculated as these geometric 385 parameters control oxygen transport in the microvasculature and can in future be used for validation
 386 Fig 4 shows these results for 2 different layers  the top-most grey matter layer, and the middle layer 387 (from

 A line of best fit is plotted in black, with the fit equation in the top right 398 corner of each graph, with the bottom left of the graph giving the coefficients of the line of best 399 The permeability is generally robust with vessel fraction blocked, up to around 50 % of the vessels 401 before the permeability starts to drop more rapidly
 This can be explained by the fact that many small 402 vessels are occluded first  due to 98% of all emboli having a diameter of < 20 m for this configuration 403 of clot consistency and thrombectomy technique  which has a relatively small impact on the 404 permeability
 On the other hand, the permeability drops almost linearly with volume fraction blocked 405 Interestingly, in the middle layer for all 3 dependent variables, the permeabilitys robustness to 407 occlusions appears to improve over the first 40-50% of vessel/volume occlusions
 As the vessels 408 continue to be occluded, however, the drop off in permeability is quicker than in the topmost layers
 409 The variability increases with depth until by the time the bottom two layers are reached, there is almost 410 a dichotomous choice between a permeability of 1 and 0 (S2 Fig)
 This is due to the sparse number of 411 vessels in the lower layers, leading to them being vulnerable to very few micro-emboli
 412 The permeability, and its drops with successive micro-emboli, can thus be characterised as a 2-413 dimensional surface
 The equation for the healthy permeability distribution with depth can be 414 multiplied, at each depth layer, by the respective permeability drop equation for that depth layer
 An 415 example of a 2-dimensional surface generated with volume fraction as the dependent variable, ADAPT 416 as the thrombectomy technique, and a hard clot can be found in Fig 5 (calculated using the healthy 417 permeability equation from Fig b)
 These 2-dimensional functions can be calculated for all the 418 different possible combinations of thrombectomy, clot, and dependent variable
 This provides a simple 419 look-up table to determine the change in permeability for a given technique, clot, depth, and fraction 420  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30,

 A 2-dimensional surface plot for the ADAPT thrombectomy technique removing a hard 423 clot
 The permeability is plotted against voxel depth and volume fraction of the vessels occluded
 424 The coupling coefficients also display non-linear behaviour with micro-emboli occlusions, but this 425 behaviour is far more variable than the permeability results
 This is due to blood being rerouted as 426 occlusions occur, leading to coupling coefficients increasing as well as decreasing from the baseline
 427 As well as this, the coupling coefficients are also dependent on the pressure in the capillary beds and 428 terminal arterioles (Eq ())
 An example of the change in coupling coefficients with depth and volume 429 
3 The microvascular geometry dictates robustness to micro-emboli smaller than the 431 To investigate the role of the microvasculature on robustness to micro-emboli, 3 voxels were chosen 433 from our 100 voxels
 Each voxel had 100 micro-emboli simulations with each simulation having a 434 different clot distribution sampled
 Fig 6 shows the changes of permeability for these 3 voxels for the 435 middle-layer
 As can be seen, it appears that the microvascular topology dictates the response to micro-436 emboli, with clear banded regions with non-linear jumps for some voxels, whilst other voxels have an 437  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30,

 A comparison of the permeability drop against volume fraction occluded for 3 different 441 voxel geometries simulated with 100 different clot distributions (for the ADAPT technique, hard 442 clot) a) Voxel 1, b) Voxel 4, c) Voxel 31 443 In comparison, we simulated 100 different voxels but with the same sampled clot distribution entering 444 each voxel (we fix the random seed sampling the clot distribution to be the same for each voxel)
 The 445 aim of this was to investigate the effect of the sampled clot distribution variability on perfusion 446 characteristics (similar to how we investigated the effect of microvascular variability in Fig )
 There 447 was little visual difference found for the 3 sampled clot distributions (S4 Fig)
 Similar behaviour is 448 also seen for the coupling coefficients, with linear drops in coupling coefficients seen for some voxels 449  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30, 
 ;    Quantifying the statistical differences between these distributions was complicated by the bivariate 451 nature of the distributions
 As such, to provide a simple comparison, we use the correlation matrix 452 difference (CMD) to compare the covariances of each distribution against the baseline distribution 453 (Fig f)
 The CMD has a value of 0 when the covariance matrices are identical and a value of 1 when 454 they are orthogonal When comparing the 3 constant microvascular simulations the range of the CMD 455 was 1x10-4 to 
 x-
 For the constant clot simulations, the range was 7x10-6 to 3x10-4 indicating 456 that variability and robustness to micro-emboli is dominated by the microvascular geometry
 457 
4 Hard clot micro-emboli lead to larger drops in permeability 458 The above analysis has all been conducted using hard clot fragmentation data
 We now simulate soft 459 clot fragmentation and the effect of these micro-emboli on flow characteristics
 We are interested to 460 Visually, there is no discernible difference for the relationship between permeability and the dependent 462 variable on the population level, but certain voxels display changes in their permeability relationship 463 (S6 Fig)
 Comparing individual microvascular geometries in both hard and soft clot simulations, the 464 CMD score ranges between 3x10-4 and 7x10-3, indicating a similar variability to that found between 465 voxel comparisons
 The results are similar for the coupling coefficients
 466 Regardless of whether there was a visual difference or not, all voxels with soft clot simulations required 467 on average twice as many occluding clots to develop the same drops in perfusion as for the hard clots
 468 As well as this, around 
5% of the clots sampled from the hard clot distributions went into occluding 469 penetrating vessels (the rest passed through the arterioles into the capillary bed)
 For the soft clots, this 470 was only 
5% (Table )
 Clearly, for a given number of micro-emboli the smaller clot fragments of the 471 Table

5 Thrombectomy technique has a large impact on clot fragmentation and downstream 477 The last variable of interest here is the thrombectomy technique
 In the in-vitro experiments, 4 479 techniques were used; these are abbreviated as ADAPT, BGC, GC at cervical ICA, and Solumbra []
 480 The emboli distributions from these 4 techniques used on hard and soft clots were used to simulate 481  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30,

 The results are shown in Fig 7 where the scatter plots have been 482 binned into deciles with mean and standard deviation for ease of viewing
 483 Fig 
 Comparison of the permeability drops against volume fraction blocked in the middle layer 485 for 4 different thrombectomy techniques: a) removing hard clots and b) removing soft clots  486 Despite there being little visual difference between the 4 techniques, when analysing the numbers of 487 clots required to reach similar drops in permeability, large differences emerge (summarised in Table )
 488 We measured: the average number of micro-emboli sampled in total to fully occlude the voxel (column 489 3 of Table 1); the average number of these micro-emboli that occlude a penetrating vessel (column 4 of 490 Table 1); and hence the percentage of sampled clots that occluded the penetrating vessels (column 5 of 491 Table )
 Simulating the Solumbra technique on a hard clot resulted in the fewest clots required to fully 492 occlude the voxel; on average over the 100 voxels 
6 clots (and hence 26% of sampled clots) sent 493 through the penetrating vessels were required to fully occlude the voxel
 The BGC technique had the 494 next fewest clots required with 26 clots and 14% of the sampled clots
 The GC at cervical ICA 495 technique, on the other hand required 29 clots and 
9% of the sampled clots
 496 In contrast, when using the soft clots, the numbers of clots required to achieve similar permeability 497 drops drastically increased  except for GC at cervical ICA which had similar results compared to when 498 using the hard clots
 Both the Solumbra and ADAPT techniques saw a doubling of the clots required
 499  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30, 
 ;    Clearly, there is a trade-off between the number of emboli that fragment off a clot, the size of these 500 emboli, and the impact they have on downstream flow
 The BGC and Solumbra techniques were 501 previously reported to minimise the fragmentation of hard clots [20], but this also means that these clots 502 are larger and hence more prone to occlude larger vessels (as indicated by our large percentage of clots 503 that occlude vessels in the above results)
 On the other hand, the ADAPT and Solumbra techniques used 504 on soft clots lead to twice as many clots being required to occlude the penetrating vessels to achieve 505 
6 Occlusions in the capillary bed lead to large drops in permeability 507 Finally, we simulated micro-emboli occluding capillary bed networks
 These were simulated for 500 508 statistically accurate networks at 3 different cube length sizes (375 m, 500 m, and 625 m)
 As the 509 results were not statistically different over the 3 sizes, only the 375 m results are presented in Fig 
 510 The permeability maintained its isotropy in the presence of micro-emboli hence it is presented here as 511 Fig

 ;    The permeability drop in the capillary bed was large in comparison to the drop in the penetrating vessels: 518 -8 % / % surface area lost, -
2 % / % vessel blocked, and -
1 % / % volume blocked (see Fig )
 This 519 is in line with a previous study where a -
5 % drop in CBF/ % vessels blocked was found in simulations 520 of occlusions in mouse and human vascular networks, as well as mouse synthetic networks []
 It 521 should be noted that the synthetic networks used in [13] had uniform diameter and length, unlike the 522 networks in this paper which have length and diameter distributions that match physiological 523 Assuming a micro-emboli shower is spread evenly over the MCA territory (approx
 100 mL of tissue), 525 
5% of this volume is capillary vessels, and a vessel density of 8000 vessels/mm3, around 120,000 526 micro-emboli would have to enter the capillary bed to cause a 4% drop in permeability (note that this 527 is an overestimate as micro-emboli are not likely to spread evenly over the brain tissue)
 Depending on 528 thrombectomy technique, the number of micro-emboli fragmenting off the clot can vary from a few 529 thousand to over 500,000 []
 It therefore appears that if micro-emboli enter the capillary bed there is 530 We return to the questions posed at the end of the introduction
 First, can the changes in the blood flow 533 modelling parameters due to micro-emboli showers be accurately quantified such that they can be used 534 in the full organ models? Using a combination of in-vitro experiments of clot fragmentation and in-535 silico blood flow modelling, we have developed simulations of micro-emboli occluding vessels in the 536 penetrating arterioles and capillary bed
 Using these models we characterised averaged flow 537 parameters, such as permeability and coupling coefficients, in healthy conditions and under micro-538 emboli showers, for a range of thrombectomy techniques and clot consistencies
 This now enables us 539 to simulate the impact of these micro-emboli showers  after a thrombectomy  on the downstream 540  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30, 
 ;    Second, what impact do thrombectomy technique and clot consistency have on downstream blood flow 542 post-thrombectomy? Clot consistency and thrombectomy techniques have been shown here to have a 543 large impact on the blood flow parameters
 Whilst the relationship between permeability and volume 544 of vessel occluded was similar, the numbers of micro-emboli required were substantially different, with 545 soft clots on average requiring twice as many micro-emboli to reach similar drops in permeability
 The 546 Solumbra and BGC techniques used on hard clots resulted in larger micro-emboli entering the 547 microvasculature, and hence fewer vessels needing to be occluded to reach large drops in permeability
 548 Therefore, whereas the Solumbra and BGC techniques result in fewer emboli fragmenting off the clot 549 [20], these emboli can cause more damage to the microvasculature due to their larger sizes
 550 In addition to this we investigated the impact of microvascular morphometry on blood flow parameters
 551 Microvascular morphometry determined the robustness of penetrating vessels to occlusions, not the 552 sampled micro-clot distribution
 Therefore, if we can measure the microvasculature, even if only 553 indirectly, we can determine whether the microvasculature will be robust to a micro-emboli shower
 554 Characterising the microvasculature and its robustness, e
 g
 through the residue function [34], will be 555 Finally, we compared drops in permeability for the penetrating vessels and capillary bed
 Whilst the 557 penetrating vessels had an approximately 1:1 relationship between volume lost and permeability drop, 558 the capillary bed lost 4% of permeability per 1% volume drop
 This lack of robustness to occlusions in 559 the capillary bed is surprising but has previously been reported elsewhere with capillary stalling in 560 mouse capillary beds
 In blood flow simulations, Cruz-Hernandez et al found that for every 1% of 561 vessels stalled, the flow drops by 
5% []
 Our results indicate a 
2% drop in permeability (a 562 surrogate for flow) for every 1% of vessels blocked, which show good agreement for early studies
 563 Permeability is a more robust metric than CBF here due to CBF being dependent on the volume of 564 tissue simulated
 As well as this, Schmid et al found that the severity of a micro-occlusion in the 565 capillary bed depends on the connectivity and original flow rate of the occluded vessel, with large 566 reductions in flow for specific types of connectivities []
 As we found for the penetrating vessels, 567 morphometry of the microvasculature plays a large role in robustness to micro-occlusions
 568  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30, 
 ;    The smallest micro-emboli sizes available from our experimental data were 8 m
 While this was 569 sufficient for micro-emboli occlusions in the penetrating vessels, we did not have information on 570 smaller micro-emboli that would occlude the capillary vessels
 This meant we could not track emboli 571 through the capillary bed
 In future, data on micro-emboli < 8 m in diameter would help in more 572 clearly understanding how micro-emboli affect the capillary bed
 The diameters measured were the 573 Feret diameters of the micro-emboli, however we used these diameters to assume spherical micro-574 emboli
 It is therefore possible that our drops in permeability are over-estimated, as the clot could orient 575 It should be noted that a limitation of the analysis presented here is the separate treatment of the 577 penetrating arterioles and capillary bed
 This was done for two reasons
 Firstly, to provide a comparison 578 to previous studies, as discussed above
 Primarily, however, this was done to fit into our full brain 579 modelling framework where the capillary bed and penetrating arterioles are treated as separate 580 compartments coupled together via coupling coefficients
 The effects of extravasation of the micro-581 emboli in the capillary bed have also been neglected, and these will likely result in restoration of flow 582 over several days []
 This model is also purely passive, with no hyperaemia or regulation of vascular 583 tone, which likely impact passage of micro-emboli through the microvasculature
  584 The final question posed was: To what extent is clot fragmentation responsible for the post-585 thrombectomy no-reflow phenomenon? We only analysed the impact of micro-emboli in voxels, or 586 cortical columns of microvasculature
 In order to fully understand the impact of micro-emboli on the 587 vasculature, a full brain simulation is required
 In future, we will use the work developed here to 588 simulate micro-emboli showers in a full-brain in-silico simulation of thrombectomy
 Blood flow 589 parameters in the full-brain model will be updated using the parameters derived here, and the impact of 590 micro-emboli in a region of the brain can be compared and validated against CT perfusion and MR 591 scans of patients pre- and post-thrombectomy
 Furthermore, we will investigate further the impact of 592 microvascular morphometry on blood flow drops and how this can potentially be used to infer patient 593  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 30,
