 ;    Background: Proteinuria screening is recommended for patients with hypertension to screen for kidney disease and identify those at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease
 However, screening rates among hypertensive patients are low
 Home testing strategies may be useful in improving proteinuria screening Methods: We conducted an individual-level, randomized trial at 55 primary care clinic sites in the Geisinger Health System to evaluate the effectiveness of a strategy using home smartphone urinalysis test (Dip
io) to complete proteinuria screening in previously unscreened non-diabetic patient portal users with hypertension
 All patients received an educational letter and a standing urinalysis lab order, and then were randomized to control (usual care) or intervention
 Intervention arm participants were invited to complete proteinuria screening with a mailed home smartphone urinalysis test
 Co-primary outcomes were completion of proteinuria screening and number of albuminuria cases (albumin/creatinine ratio [ACR]  30 mg/g or protein/creatinine ratio  150 mg/g) at the end of 3 months
 We also evaluated patient satisfaction with the home test, and compliance with recommendations for patients with newly detected albuminuria
 Results: A total of 999 patients were randomized to intervention or control
 Out of 499 patients assigned to the intervention arm, 253 were reached by phone, and 69/97 (
1%) consented patients completed the home test
 Overall, the intervention increased proteinuria screening completion (
9% vs
 
0%; p<
001) with no effect on the number of albuminuria cases (4 vs
 4) although only 6/57 (
5%) patients with trace or 1+ urine dipstick protein had a follow-up quantitative test
 Among the 55 patients who completed a survey after the home test, 89% preferred testing at home rather than the physicians office
  Conclusions: A strategy using a home urinalysis smartphone test increased proteinuria screening rates in previously unscreened patients with hypertension and may be useful in increasing rates of proteinuria screening compliance
 Future studies are needed to determine whether improving early detection of kidney certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Presence of albuminuria or proteinuria is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular and kidney disease[1, ]
 While guidelines recommend screening for kidney disease using urinalysis dipstick for patients with hypertension (and urine albumin/creatinine ratio [ACR] for those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease [CKD])[3, 4], screening remains suboptimal[-]
 Top research priorities raised by patients with CKD include improving strategies of early kidney disease identification, which could allow implementation of interventions to slow progression of disease [9, ]
 Presence of albuminuria or proteinuria can also be helpful in risk stratification to determine which patients may benefit from management with blood pressure medications, One potential barrier to screening is that patients may not be able to provide a urine sample in the office
 Extending testing to the home may be a novel strategy to improve proteinuria screening
 For example, use of mailed fecal occult blood testing kits has been shown to double compliance with colorectal cancer screening[12, ]
 The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of home urinalysis testing, using a smartphone urinalysis kit (Dip
io), among previously unscreened patients with This study was an individual-level, randomized trial that included 999 patients at 55 primary care clinic sites in the Geisinger Health System, a large integrated health system in rural Pennsylvania
 Funding was provided by the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), and the Geisinger Institutional Review Board approved the protocol (-)
 Health care providers and pharmacists across the system received education about management of proteinuria as well as information about the research study in small group lectures

 ;    We used electronic health record data to identify eligible patients with hypertension who had never undergone proteinuria screening by any method
 Inclusion criteria included Geisinger primary care patients  18 years of age with a hypertension diagnosis, blood pressure  130/80 mmHg at last outpatient visit, and active patient portal use with a listed phone number and email address
 Main exclusion criteria included diabetes, end-stage renal disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 15 ml/min/
73 mA total of 999 patients met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and received a mailed reminder to complete proteinuria screening, a National Kidney Foundation educational booklet about the importance of proteinuria screening, and a standing Geisinger lab urinalysis order March 19-21, 
 Since proteinuria screening is standard-of-care for patients with hypertension, informed consent was not required for this initial contact
 A computer program was then used to randomize patients 1:1 to the intervention or control arm, stratified by Patients in the control arm received no intervention, whereas patients in the intervention arm received a notification letter about the home urine smartphone test approximately 2 weeks later, with an option to opt-out of further contact by the research team
 This was followed by telephone calls by the Geisinger Survey unit, who made up to 7 attempts and left up to 3 voicemails
 We also conducted weekly data pulls to identify and remove any patients from the call list who had already completed proteinuria screening at the Geisinger lab
 Patients who provided consent were sent a text message link to download the dip

io test consists of a home test kit and a smartphone application
 The kit consists of a standard 10 parameter urinalysis dipstick, a custom designed urine cup and a color-board, which enables accurate analysis in different lighting environments
 To conduct the test, patients open the app, follow directions provided on-screen, collect urine in the provided container, dip the urinalysis dipstick (Acon Mission), place the dipstick on the color board, and then scan the dipstick and color board using the app
  For this project, results were transmitted to a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant website portal, which was accessed by the research team
 The study team contacted patients with abnormal home test results, and ordered confirmation ACR testing for trace or greater urine protein on urinalysis, or repeat urinalysis testing at a Geisinger laboratory for other urinalysis abnormalities along with notification to the PCP
 For patients with detected albuminuria, the study team sent a notification to the PCP with the following guideline-based recommendations: treat to office blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg, treat with ACEI or ARB and statin
 Providers had the option of referral for further management by pharmacists, who received training in management of albuminuria and hypertension
 PCPs were blinded to their patients assignment with the exception that if an abnormal home test resulted, PCPs were later informed of the result
 Final outcome data was assessed by a Co-primary outcomes were completion of proteinuria screening by any method and number of quantified albuminuria cases (ACR  30 mg/g or protein/creatinine ratio  150 mg/g) at the end of 3 months (//)

 Of the remaining 452 participants, the survey unit successfully reached 253 patients, and 35 participants completed proteinuria screening at an outpatient Geisinger lab

 ;    In this multi-site, randomized controlled trial in a large, rural, integrated health system, we found that use of mailed smartphone urinalysis kits increased rates of albuminuria screening among previously unscreened patients with hypertension
 While only 19% in the intervention arm received the home testing kit, 71% of those who received the kit completed testing
 Those who completed home testing were highly satisfied and preferred testing at home vs
 the lab, suggesting that home testing may be a useful strategy to improve While our intervention improved screening, there was no difference in the number of detected albuminuria cases, confirmed by quantitative ACR or PCR testing
 Several factors may have limited our ability to detect more albuminuria cases
 Foremost, we required informed consent to send home testing kits to patients as the study was conducted prior to the 2018 FDA approval of dip
 io
 Thus, only 97/499 (
4%) in the intervention arm provided consent to receive the home testing kit
 Conducting this trial with a full waiver of consent would have allowed more patients in the intervention arm to receive the home testing kits and likely more screening completions
 Second, we targeted non-diabetic, hypertensive patients, who had never received screening
 This resulted in a study population that was at the healthier spectrum of at-risk patients who should be screened for albuminuria/proteinuria
 Lastly, very few patients with trace or 1+ protein underwent confirmation testing by quantitative ACR or protein/creatinine ratio, over a relatively short follow-up period
 It is possible that traveling to the laboratory for confirmation testing may pose an additional barrier; future studies should Other studies have described similarly suboptimal rates of screening among patients at risk of CKD and even 
 For example, in a study of stage 3-4 CKD patients receiving care from 2004-2008 in a group practice in eastern Massachusetts, only 30% had annual urine protein monitoring completed[]

 Thus, use of home testing may have a role in further improving adherence to There were several limitations in this proof-of-concept study
 Due to the requirement of having a smartphone to test the urinalyses, we limited our mostly white, patient population to active patient portal users, and results may not be generalizable to non-portal users
 While smartphone ownership has risen from 35% in 2011 to 77% in 2018[18], other screening strategies may also be needed to reach those without access to smartphones
 Whether or not early detection of albuminuria can improve outcomes will require future large-scale studies with longer follow-up and consideration of strategies to increase patient engagement and Our intervention using smartphone-based home testing was successful in increasing proteinuria screening rates in previously unscreened patients with hypertension and may be preferable for some patients
 We also found that few patients with trace or 1+ urine protein underwent follow-up ACR testing, limiting the effectiveness of a urine dipstick-first screening strategy
 Further research is needed to evaluate home testing strategies using quantitative or semi-quantitative ACR for screening and confirmation of albuminuria, and to determine whether increasing albuminuria screening can improve patient-centered kidney and cardiovascular certified by peer review) is the author/funder
