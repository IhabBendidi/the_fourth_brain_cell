 Kydd3, Benjamin Thompson1, 4 1School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of Auckland, New Zealand (SSRIs) can enhance plasticity within the mature visual cortex and enable recovery from amblyopia
 The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the SSRI citalopram combined with part-time patching of the fellow fixing eye would improve amblyopic eye visual acuity in adult humans
 Following a cross-over, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled design (pre-eye patching
 One block combined patching with citalopram (20 mg/day) and the other with a placebo tablet
 The blocks were separated by a 2-week washout period
 The primary outcome was change in amblyopic eye visual acuity
 Secondary outcomes included stereoacuity and randomized, fewer than our pre-specified sample size of 
 There were no statistically significant differences in amblyopic eye visual acuity change between the active (mean  SD change = 
 
16 logMAR) and the placebo (mean change = -
 
03 logMAR) blocks
 No treatment effects were observed for any secondary outcomes
 However, 3 of 7 participants experienced a 
1 logMAR or greater improvement in amblyopic eye visual acuity in the active but not the placebo block
 These results from a small sample suggest that larger-scale trials of SSRI treatment for adult amblyopia may be warranted
 Considerations for future trials include drug dose, Disruptions to binocular vision such as strabismus (an eye turn) or anisometropia (unequal refractive error between the two eyes) during the critical period of visual development can cause a neurodevelopmental disorder of vision called amblyopia [1, ]
 The deficits associated with amblyopia encompass a wide range of monocular and binocular visual functions [3, 4] and also extend to the fellow fixing eye []
 Clinically, amblyopia is typically diagnosed on the basis of a monocular visual acuity loss that cannot be explained by ocular pathology combined with an amblyogenic factor []
  Current treatments for amblyopia in childhood involve the provision of refractive correction followed by patching or penalization of the fellow fixing eye to promote use of the amblyopic eye
 These treatments are effective [6-12], but efficacy appears to decline with increasing age in children [13-16], possibly due to a decline in neural plasticity as the visual cortex matures and exits the critical period for visual development [-]

 ;    demonstrates that vision can improve in adult humans with amblyopia through interventions such as monocular [21, 22] and binocular [23-27] perceptual learning and non-invasive brain stimulation [-]
 However, these approaches have not yet translated into positive randomized clinical trials in adult patients that are required for translation into clinical practice []
  Amblyopia also forms the basis of a prominent non-human animal model for studying cortical development and plasticity []
 Monocular amblyopia can be induced in non-human animals within the critical period of visual development using an eyelid suture, induction of strabismus, or provision of anisometropic refractive error []
 Over the past decade or so, a considerable number of studies have used this model to explore post-critical period neuroplasticity []
 Successful interventions for amblyopia recovery in post-critical period animal models include dark exposure [37, 38], enriched visual environments [39], food restriction [40], binocular Pharmaceutical interventions have also been investigated in rodent models of amblyopia
 A particularly striking result was reported by Maya Vettencourt et al [44] whereby chronic administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine enabled recovery of normal visual cortex responses and visual acuity in mature rats with unilateral deprivation amblyopia
 This effect occurred when fluoxetine was administered before and during eyelid suture of the non-deprived eye and opening of the deprived eye (a procedure known as a reverse suture)
 The improvements in visual function were linked to reduced GABA mediated inhibition within the visual cortex and increased expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
 This finding is of particular interest in the context of amblyopia treatment in adult humans because SSRIs are widely available to clinicians
 Furthermore, SSRIs may enhance plasticity within the human motor [45, 46] and visual [47] cortex
 Fluoxetine has also been found to enhance physiotherapy outcomes after stroke, possibly by increasing cortical plasticity []
 However, fluoxetine did not enhance visual perceptual learning of a motion discrimination task or motor Two studies have investigated the use of fluoxetine to treat human amblyopia
 Sharif et al [50] compared 3 months of fellow fixing eye patching plus fluoxetine (
5mg/kg/day, n = 20) to patching plus a placebo tablet placebo (n = 15) in older children and adults (10-40 years) with amblyopia
  A significantly greater amblyopic eye visual acuity improvement in the fluoxetine compared to the placebo group was observed
 However, Huttunen et al [51] found no differences in visual function improvement between a group of adults with amblyopia treated for 10 days with combined perceptual learning and fluoxetine (20 mg per day, n = 22) and a group treated with perceptual learning combined with a placebo tablet (n = )
  In this study we explored the effects of 2 weeks (14 days) of the SSRI citalopram combined with fellow fixing eye patching on visual acuity, stereopsis and visually evoked retinal and cortical responses in adults with amblyopia
 We anticipated that recruitment would be challenging due to the use of patching and the administration of an anti-depressant drug
 We therefore adopted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double blind, crossover design
 In this context citalopram was chosen over fluoxetine (as used in prior studies) because citalopram has a shorter half-life [52] certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    that allowed for a manageable washout period to be incorporated into the design of the study
  No significant effects of citalopram were observed, although our study may have been The single-site trial involved two blocks of fellow fixing eye patching each lasting two weeks separated by a two-week washout period
 Participants were provided with citalopram (1 x 20mg tablet per day) during one patching block and otherwise identical placebo tablets (sucrose) during the other block
 Block order was randomized using a random number generator
 The timing of baseline and outcome measures are shown in Figure 
 Only the pharmacist dispensing the tablets, who did not interact with study participants, was unmasked to block order
 Study participants and all other members of the research team were masked to the randomization
 The study was approved by the Northern X Regional Ethics Committee in New Zealand Participants completed a screening protocol consisting of a telephone interview followed by a full optometric examination, medical history, the Profile of Mood State Short Form questionnaire Study inclusion criteria were: 18 years of age or over, 
2 logMAR or worse visual acuity in the amblyopic eye, 
0 logMAR or better visual acuity in the fellow fixing eye, an interocular acuity difference of at least 
2 logMAR, the presence of a strabismus and/or anisometropia defined as a difference in spherical equivalent refractive error of 
5 dioptres or greater between the eyes
 The exclusion criteria were: the presence of ocular pathology, an explanation for the visual acuity loss other than amblyopia, personal or family history of a mood disorder, diabetes, history of addiction, current use of medications or supplements known to alter mood, medications that interact with SSRIs such as codeine and abnormal mood states evident on the mood questionnaires as reviewed by a psychiatrist
 Prior to randomization, participants who were not wearing optimal full correction for both eyes were provided with full correction (either spectacles or contact lenses) and were reviewed every four weeks until visual acuity was stable (<
2 logMAR difference between visits)

 The following tests were applied monocularly (right eye first); pattern-ERG (1 check size  modified from the 
8 standard for direct comparison with the VEP stimuli), VEP (1 and 
3 check sizes), multifocal ERG with pupil dilation
 ERG measures were included so that any retinal effects of citalopram could be accounted for if the trial was positive
 The POMS-SF questionnaire was completed at each study visit and participants completed a patching diary for each 2-week patching session
 Brain derived neurotropic factor (BNDF) phenotype has been identified as a possible mediator of cortical plasticity [53] and BNDF upregulation has been identified as a mechanism for increased visual cortex plasticity following fluoxetine administration in rats []
 To test for BDNF polymorphisms, participants provided a blood sample directly after the first two-week block of patching
 Following a previously reported protocol [49], an Agena MassArray IPLEX assay (Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for genotyping
 A Brucker Mass Spectrometer with optimized parameters for iPLEX chemistry was then used to resolve single base extensions
 Typer 4 analysis software (Agena Bioscience) enabled visual inspection of generated peaks in comparison to the non-template control
  At the time of study initiation, no previous studies of SSRIs in human amblyopia treatment were available

 ;    found no effect of the SSRI citalopram combined with two weeks of patching on amblyopic eye visual acuity or a range of secondary outcome measures in adults with amblyopia
 These results are broadly consistent with another recent study with a similar duration treatment period (10 days) that reported no advantage of combining fluoxetine with perceptual learning compared to perceptual learning alone in adults with amblyopia []
 A preliminary study of donepezil [54] and a randomized clinical trial of levodopa [55] have also found no benefit of drug treatment in amblyopia therapy
 In addition, we found no effect of two weeks of patching alone in adult patients despite reasonable self-reported adherence
 This is expected based on the short treatment period and the reduced effect of patching with increasing age [15, 16, ]
 A number of factors may explain the lack of a drug treatment effect in our study
 First, and perhaps most importantly, we did not achieve our planned sample size of 20 participants due to difficulties with recruitment
 This led to a small sample with varied amblyopia etiology and treatment history
 Barriers to recruitment included the time commitment required by the study and the stringent medical inclusion criteria
 Therefore, our study may be underpowered to detect a treatment effect, although the sample size is within the range of previous case-series perceptual learning studies that have reported treatment effects []
 It is intriguing that three participants exhibited an amblyopic eye visual acuity improvement of 
1 logMAR or greater for the active but not the placebo treatment sessions
 These participants had relatively poor baseline amblyopic eye visual acuity compared to most of the other participants
 No participants exhibited any improvement for the placebo sessions
 This observation suggests that further testing of SSRI Whereas previous studies have used fluoxetine, we used citalopram because it has a short lead in period of two hours []
 Moreover, citalopram has a shorter half-life than fluoxetine; the distribution phase lasts about ten hours and the terminal half-life (T1/2) is 30-35 hours for citalopram [58] in contrast to two to four days half-life for fluoxetine []
 Citalopram and fluoxetine appear to have the same efficacy for treating major depression [60] and comparable effects on plasma GABA, glutamine and glutamate levels in human patients []
 However, citalopram and fluoxetine have different patterns of binding affinity within the human brain []
 It is currently unknown whether the two drugs differ in the extent to which they promote visual We used a 20 mg/day dose of citalopram over 2 weeks
 It is possible that larger doses and longer treatment times are required to replicate the effects found in non-human animals
 Supporting this idea, Sharif et al [50] found a significant effect of combined fluoxetine and patching with dose of 
5 mg/kg/day and a 3-month treatment period whereas Huttunen et al [51] found no effect with 20 mg per day over 10 days
 The parameter space for dosing and treatment duration is large for drug intervention studies of this type and further work is required to identify optimal values
 In addition, genotype may also influence an individuals response to a pharmacological intervention
 In this study we measured BDNF polymorphisms because they have been linked to neuroplasticity [53] and an increase in BDNF expression has been identified as a key mechanism in SSRI-induced recovery from amblyopia in mature rats []
 There was no relationship between BDNF polymorphism and treatment response in this study with both val/val and val66met certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    carriers improving by 1 logMAR line or more
 However, the small sample size precludes any In agreement with Huttunen et al [51], we found no effect of SSRI treatment on VEP parameters
 This is in contrast to other emerging potential approaches to amblyopia treatment in adulthood such as the non-invasive brain stimulation technique anodal transcranial direct current stimulation that increases VEP amplitude []
 The lack of any VEP changes is consistent with the lack of a treatment effect on any of the other outcome measures used within this study
 Retinal electrophysiology was also conducted to rule out any retinal changes if a positive treatment effect was observed
 No retinal changes were observed, in agreement with the overall study In addition to the small sample size, a weakness of our study is that one participant (P6) did not meet the visual acuity inclusion criteria
 We retained this participant in the study due to difficulties with recruitment
 We note that excluding this participant from the sample does not In conclusion, we found no effect of 2 weeks of combined citalopram and patching on amblyopic eye visual acuity in adults with amblyopia
 This result may have been due to our study being underpowered as a result of recruitment challenges
 Three out of seven participants did exhibit an amblyopic eye visual acuity improvement of 
1 logMAR or more with combined citalopram and patching suggesting that further studies in this area may be warranted
