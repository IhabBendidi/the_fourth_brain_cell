 Main outcomes Results: Bacteriophage therapy was initiated 4-10 days after antibiotic commencement, at 109 plaque-forming units (PFU) twice daily
 Infecting staphylococci were typical of common local subtypes
 Initial input ratio of phages to bacteria in the bloodstream (MOIinput) was >
 Five of the thirteen patients died by D28 and a sixth patient suffered sudden cardiac death on D
 Bacteriophage therapy coincided with a marked reduction in staphylococcal bacterial DNA in the blood and in sepsis-associated inflammatory responses in almost all cases
 No bacteriophage-attributable adverse events were identified
 Development of bacteriophage resistance was not observed
 Population analysis revealed no significant effect of bacteriophage therapy on the gut Conclusions and Relevance: Adjunctive bacteriophage therapy appears to be safe and well-tolerated in critically ill patients with severe S
 aureus infection
 Two weeks of twice daily intravenous administration may be a suitable protocol
 Controlled trials are needed

 aureus bacteraemia is associated with a 30-day mortality of ~%y
 This nearly doubles in the setting of infective endocarditis (IE), of which it is the leading cause1, and attributable mortality Bacteriophages (phages) are natural viral predators of bacteria that have been used therapeutically for over a century, including for S
 aureus sepsis
 Long overshadowed by antibiotics, phage therapy is now experiencing a renaissance as adjunctive therapy to antibiotics and for severe antibiotic-resistant infections
 AB-SA01 (AmpliPhi Biosciences) is a GMP-quality preparation of three Myoviridae bacteriophages (109 PFU of each) with broad activity against S
 aureus, the safety of which was recently demonstrated for intranasal therapy of chronic rhinosinusitis
 Here, we describe a single-centre experience with thirteen cases of intravenous AB-SA01 therapy for severe S
 aureus infections including prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) An open-label protocol was approved by our institutions Ethics Committee for adjunctive therapy with AB-SA
  Informed consent was sought from patients with two or more consecutive daily blood cultures positive for S
 aureus if the treating clinician and two independent infectious diseases specialists agreed that treatment was already optimal, significant risk of poor outcome remained and imminent demise (<48hours) was not expected (Figure )
 AB-SA01 was administered intravenously twice daily for 14 days in 50-100 mL of

 Vital signs were monitored during and immediately after phage administration for up to 4 hours after the first dose and clinical, haematological and blood biochemical parameters were monitored out to 90 days in a standardised protocol (Table )
 Charlson comorbidity indices (CCI, a guide to one-year mortality on the basis of pre-existing comorbidities)6, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores (a predictor of in-hospital mortality for intensive care cohorts)7 and IE mortality risk scores (a 6-month mortality predictor for IE)8 were calculated
 S
 aureus isolates were tested for susceptibility to antibiotics (BD Phoenix, USA) and to AB-SA01 and Quantitative PCR targeting nuc and femA of S
 aureus and the primase gene of Myoviridae (5- 3 reverse) was performed on DNA extracted from whole blood (S
 aureus) and serum (phage) respectively (Figure )
 Viable phages were quantified in serum by diluting onto lawns of a sequence type 239, which yielded clear plaques by a standard method9 at ten-fold dilutions of the AB-SA
 Phage efficiency of plating (EOP, an indirect in vitro measure of lysis efficiency) was determined for each isolate in triplicate
 RNA was extracted from whole blood10 for transcriptomic analysis (Figure C)
 Bacterial population diversity was assessed by 16S rRNA Thirteen patients with severe complicated S
 aureus bacteraemia received AB-SA01 from August 2017 to September 2018, inclusive (Figure 1 & Table )

 All received flucloxacillin (n=10), cefazolin (n=2) or vancomycin (n=1) as primary therapy for six weeks or until active therapy was ceased, often with additional ciprofloxacin and/or rifampicin (Table 1), with infectious diseases specialist supervision throughout
 Phage therapy began within 4-10 days of Three died in the first week (WMP003, WMP006 and WMP011), two after withdrawal of therapy due to expected poor outcomes and one (WMP003) during attempted surgical source control after only 48 hours of phage therapy following 8 days of unremitting bacteraemic shock on high-dose antibiotics (Table )
 All blood cultures and intraoperative specimens from WMP003 grew AB-SA01-susceptible S
 aureus (a leukocidin lukGH-positive ST340 strain)
 All others showed improvement by day 
 In all, six deaths occurred in the 90 day follow-up, of which five (38%) were within 28 days of starting phage therapy, with an additional sudden death In all, two patients had possible IE and six patients had definite IE, of whom four had PVE (Table )
 Two PVE cases (WMP001 and WMP010) and WMP014 (possible IE) were complicated by clinically significant cerebral emboli
 WMP010 received a second two-week course beginning on the day of prosthetic aortic valve replacement (for incompetence) after three weeks of high-dose antibiotics: resected paravalvar tissues were culture-negative but S
 aureus and Myoviridae DNA was detected
  WMP009 had metallic aortic and mitral valves replaced more than a month after finishing phage therapy when well and afebrile (on D58 of antibiotics; all resected tissues were culture negative) and WMP001 avoided valve surgery altogether

 aureus isolates were mostly (12/13) methicillin-susceptible and of common sequence types, including a single methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strain (Table )
 S
 aureus isolates from WMP011 were not lysed at all by AB-SA01 phages in vitro and EOP was reduced in two others (WMP006 and WMP013) (Table )
 Patients infected with staphylococci in which AB-SA01 produced clear plaques at >10-6 dilutions in vitro (10/13), with a predicted 6 months mortality score ~40%5, suffered an early mortality of 20% (2/10 at 28 days) and total mortality of 30% Bacteriophage susceptibility in vitro did not change in any case during or after infection
 Two unrelated bacteraemic strains of S
 aureus (an AB-SA01-susceptible ST15 strain and a non-susceptible ST398 strain) were identified in one patient (WMP008) who was lost to follow-up before D
 She was readmitted two months later with sepsis after ongoing recreational self-injection and AB-SA01-susceptible S

 Inflammatory gene signatures in whole blood transcriptomes of definite IE patients (n=4) declined significantly within 72 hours of commencing bacteriophage therapy (Figure C)
 Analysis of gut microflora using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing before and after bacteriophage therapy revealed no obvious effect on population diversity overall nor evident depletion of Firmicutes (data not shown)
 Propensity-based/ case-matching analyses were rejected as unfeasible due to the large number of variables and the small size of our cohort and because the study was designed for an endpoint of safety rather than mortality
 Nevertheless, our experience indicates that controlled trials of bacteriophage therapy are warranted to answer some of the many questions that remain, and the relatively standardised nature of antimicrobial therapy for S
 aureus infection makes this a good model
 Phage-based products have previously received U
 S
 FDA licensure for food safety applications and a recent study showed reduction of bacterial burden in superficial burns
 Here we show for the first time that that IV-administered investigational phage therapy produced The reticuloendothelial system is the most important factor in initial clearance of phage from the bloodstream13 and many successful animal studies use a single dose of phage but a few of our patients had bacteriophage detectable in blood up to 12 hours after dosing and we detected traces certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Most of our cohort, however, had cleared bacterial and phage DNA from blood within a week of starting in vitro synergy between phages and antibiotics4 but the benefit of adding bacteriophages to optimal antibiotic therapy remains uncertain
  The observed decline in inflammatory responses shortly after bacteriophage administration is consistent with previous animal data16 and may be important in suppressing destructive disease processes but may simply reflect 4-10 days of preceding antibiotics
  Robust controlled trials are needed to determine the contribution of This study is the first of its kind where an investigational GMP-quality phage product was administered intravenously to treat severe S
 aureus infections
 Administration of AB-SA01 was followed by significant reduction in bacterial burdens and inflammatory profiles and by no adverse events
 Development of resistance to AB-SA01 was not detected
 Our data indicate that AB-SA01 is suitable as adjunctive therapy for severe S
 aureus infections using the dosing strategy described, and that controlled clinical trials are an important next step
