 ;    Background: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is characterized by an alteration in pain processing by the central nervous system that may affect autonomic nervous system (ANS) balance
 Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects the balance of parasympathetic and sympathetic ANS activation
 In particular, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) solely reflects parasympathetic input and is reduced in CLBP patients
 Yet, it remains unknown if non-invasive brain stimulation can alter ANS balance in CLBP patients
 Objective: To evaluate if non-invasive brain stimulation modulates the ANS, we analyzed HRV metrics collected in a previously published study of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) for the modulation of CLBP through enhancing alpha oscillations
 We hypothesized that tACS would increase Methods: A randomized, crossover, double-blind, sham-controlled pilot study was conducted to investigate the effects of 10Hz-tACS on metrics of ANS balance calculated from electrocardiogram (ECG)
 ECG data were collected for 2 minutes before and after 40 minutes of 10Hz-tACS or sham Results: There were no significant changes in RSA or other frequency-domain HRV components from Hz-tACS
 However, exploratory time-domain HRV analysis revealed a significant increase in the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN) for 10Hz-tACS relative to sham
 Conclusion(s): Although tACS did not significantly increase RSA, we found in an exploratory analysis that tACS modulated an integrated HRV measure of both ANS branches
 These findings support the further study of how the ANS and alpha oscillations interact and are modulated by tACS

 ;    Chronic pain is a severe, disabling condition that affects 25-30% of the population in the United States (1) and treatment options are limited ()
 While opioid therapy has shown short-term efficacy in decreasing pain, few studies have investigated its long-term effectiveness (3) and systematic reviews identify multiple severe risks of long-term use, including: misuse, abuse/dependence, overdose, and death (,)
 Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the second most prevalent cause of disability in adults in the US ()
 The poor rates of recovery (58% at 1 month) and high rates of recurrence (73% in 12 months) contribute to high social and economic costs CLBP often persists without clear peripheral pathology (peripheral injury may trigger but does not sustain CLBP) and the mechanism of pain development is not fully understood ()
 In CLBP, the relationship between nociception and pain is often weak or lost indicating abnormal integration (8), which points to an alteration in pain processing by the central nervous system (,)
 CLBP stems from dynamic interactions between sensory and contextual (i
 e
, cognitive, emotional, and motivational) processes in the brain that are mediated by feed-forward and feedback processes ()
 Recent neurobiological investigations support the crucial role of the brain within chronic pain development by showing substantial structural, physiological, and metabolic changes (8) including autonomic nervous system (ANS) balance ()
 The ANS controls a range of vital involuntary physiological functions, such as regulating blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate at rest and in response to stressors ()

 HRV is composed of input from the excitatory sympathetic and inhibitory parasympathetic nervous system as well as baroreceptors and vagal tone
 When HRV is deconstructed through signal processing, it is possible to quantify rhythmic components that reflect specific pathways of the ANS neural regulation
 The most salient components are a respiratory oscillation known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)(13) and low-frequency (LF) components assumed to be related to blood pressure regulation via the Pain signal regulation is a normal part of the defensive response mediated by the nervous system
 The body reacts to illness by activating and sensitizing afferent nociceptive neurons ()
 In the case of chronic pain, this process may trigger hyperarousal of the sympathetic nervous system ()
 Based on the Polyvagal theory (18,19), an evolutionary neurophysiological model of the autonomic response to safety and threat, chronic maintenance of threat responses can lead to a compromised functional state ()
 These chronic systemic functional problems are reflected in the regulation of the heart by the most rapidly responsive component of the nervous system, the ventral vagal complex, as measured by RSA ()
 Previous studies have targeted the reduced RSA using biofeedback interventions, and HRV components have been used to measure the efficacy of chronic pain therapies ()
 Yet, little is known if targeting network pathologies by non-invasive brain stimulation can influence ANS balance in patients with CLBP

, Eugene, OR) at a sampling rate of kHz
 HRV components were extracted from ECG data (14,50) to evaluate changes in neural regulation of the ANS before and after intervention
 We placed two disposable snap electrodes below the right collarbone and left inferior costal arch
 Inter-beat intervals (IBI), which is the time between consecutive heartbeats expressed in milliseconds, were derived from detected R peaks in ECG data
 The R peaks were extracted using the Cardio Peak-Valley Detector (CPVD) (51) and the IBI event series were obtained
 The unedited IBI file was visually inspected and edited offline with CardioEdit software (developed in the Porges laboratory and implemented by researchers trained in the Porges laboratory)
 Editing consisted of integer arithmetic (i
 e
, dividing intervals between heart beats when detections of R-wave from the ECG were missed or adding intervals when spuriously invalid detections occurred)
 The resulting normal RR intervals were used in analysis when abnormal beats, like ectopic beats (heartbeats that originate outside the right atriums sinoatrial node) have been removed
 ()
 HRV time and frequency components were calculated with MATLAB and CardioBatch software (Brain-Body Center, University of Illinois at Chicago), respectively
 For HRV time components, the average of normal RR intervals (meanRR), the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN), and the root mean square differences of successive RR intervals (RMSSD) were calculated using custom-built scripts in MATLAB
 For HRV frequency components, RSA was calculated using CardioBatch software, which implements the Porges-Bohrer metric ()
 This metric is neither moderated by respiration, nor influenced by nonstationarity, and reliably generates stronger effect sizes than other commonly used metrics of RSA (steps are described in depth in (53) and validated in ()

 RSA and LF were calculated based on the Porges-Bohrer method (53,54); RSA uses a third-order, 21 point moving polynomial filter (MPF) applied to the 2 Hz IBI time series to remove low frequency oscillations and slow trend
 The residual detrended output of the MPF was filtered with a Kaiser FIR windowed filter with cut-off frequencies that removes variance not related to spontaneous breathing in adults (

 ;    In this study, we investigated how non-invasive brain stimulation (10Hz-tACS) alters ANS balance measured with RSA and how these metrics correlated with the level of pain and other self-report characteristics
 Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that there was no effect of Hz-tACS on RSA
 Previous studies using transcranial direct current stimulation increased RSA in healthy participants (,)
 However, we found a significant increase in SDNN for 10 Hz-tACS relative to sham
 Our exploratory analyses to find a relationship between baseline RSA and pain severity did not show any significant correlations in agreement with previous findings that While both sequences had a similar tACS effect on RSA (Figure 2A, left panel), we found a trending effect of greater RSA in the tACS condition compared to sham before the intervention at both sessions (Figure 4, F,=
105, p=
 )
 This finding may have limited the potential influence that 10Hz-tACS had on RSA as there was less potential for an intervention to increase RSA due to ceiling effects ()
 Previous evidence suggests that there is an optimal range for RSA based on breathing rate and vagal input ()
 Furthermore, most HRV intervention studies including biofeedback training with a slow controlled breathing rate or meditation (61) and HRV changes are measured throughout a longer duration with daily sessions for six weeks (,,)
 RSA adapts quickly due to both internal and external perturbations (20), therefore  a treatment to create a lasting effect needs to be consistent, such as structured resonance breathing training certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Within our time-domain analysis, 10Hz- tACS had a significant effect on SDNN
 The time domain analysis reports the activity of the cardiac system (63), which may in turn broadly reflect ANS balance ()
 SDNN is a commonly used parameter for the measurement of total HRV and represents the overall variability of both sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs to the heart ()
 Many studies within chronic pain have found decreased SDNN within clinical populations compared to healthy controls (12) and HRV suppression has been correlated with pain severity or disability perception (,,)
 One study (67) measured SDNN in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) with and without neuropathic pain and found significant lower resting SDNN in SCI patients with pain compared to SCI without pain and healthy controls
 Since SDNN includes input from both the parasympathetic and sympathetic input, few conclusions on the increase of specific ANS branches can be drawn (12), but SDNN has been hypothesized to provide objective quantification of analgesic response to pain treatment ()
 Therefore, increasing overall HRV (SDNN) may be beneficial in patients with CLBP, and HRV intervention studies have shown increases in total HRV ()
 Our findings thus suggest that SDNN may be a better target than Previous studies, which investigated non-invasive brain stimulation interventions in chronic pain, have shown promising, but varied results (,,)
 Most of these studies have focused on transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnet stimulation
 Given our findings of successful target engagement of alpha oscillations that correlated with clinical pain improvement as reported in our previous paper (28), tACS has the potential to provide a safe, scientifically-supported, low-cost treatment option
  However, more research utilizing tACS is needed to replicate our results and further dissect the underlying mechanism(s)

 ;    characterization (Tables 1 and 2) of the patient population provided here can be used to inform the planning of future tACS studies including the use of power calculations to inform sample As with any scientific study, the work presented here has limitations
 First, this was a pilot study and thus not designed to establish statistical significance for small effect sizes
 Our within-subject design increased our statistical power and is a strength considering large between-subject variation in many HRV components ()
 Nevertheless, all statistical results should be interpreted cautiously given the small sample size
 Second, we did not collect medication and lifestyle information unrelated to pain, such as antihistamines or caffeine use, both of which have been shown to influence HRV, albeit the within-subjects design should reduce impact of external factors ()
 Third, we only analyzed two minutes of ECG data for HRV analysis following other studies in the field (,)
 However, the current gold standard for HRV recordings is at least five minutes (74) and our study may have benefited from longer recordings
 Fourth, our crossover study design only allowed for one session of active stimulation
 TACS may have an additive effect on modulating oscillations if a design with multiple sessions were used (,)
  Future studies involving multiple stimulation sessions are the next steps since recurring stimulation sessions are likely needed to produce perceptible and lasting clinical effects due to presumed underlying mechanisms that appear to be related synaptic plasticity ()
 Several studies have investigated non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in patients with chronic pain, but treatment effects vary across the studies, and typically only clinical outcomes are reported
