 ;    Despite much debate about a perceived 'reproducibility crisis' in the life 9 sciences, it remains unclear what level of replicability is technically possible [,]
 10 Here, we analysed the variation among drug response data of the NCI60 project, 11 which for decades has  tested anti-cancer agents in a 60-cell line panel following a 12 standardised protocol []
 In total, 
8 million compound/cell line experiments are 13 available in the NCI60 resource CellMiner []
 The largest fold change between the 14 lowest and highest GI50 (concentration that reduces cell viability by 50%) in a 15 compound/cell line combination was 
16 x 
 All compound/ cell line 16 combinations with >100 experiments displayed maximum GI50 fold changes >5, 17 
7% maximum fold changes >10, 
3% maximum fold changes >100, and 
5% 18 displayed similar variation
 The variability remained very high after removal of 20 outliers and among experiments performed in the same month
 Hence, our analysis 21 shows that high variability is an intrinsic feature of experimentation in biological 22 systems, even among highly standardised experiments in a world-leading research 23 environment
 Thus, a narrow focus on experiment standardisation does not ensure a 24 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 So far, 17 replication studies have been completed
 Five 37 studies reported the successful reproduction of the original studies [16-20], while 38 eight reported a mixed outcome [21-28], and four failed to reproduce the original 39 findings [-]
 It is not clear whether these data are representative
 It is a small 40 dataset focused on small, early, and highly cited studies, which are more likely to 41 There is also a lack of agreement on the expected level of data replicability 43 []
 In a dispute about the consistency of two large pharmacogenomic screens in 44 cancer cell line panels, the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database and the 45 Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia [34-37], four analyses by different groups concluded 46 a reasonable level of consistency [37-40], while six studies, all by the same group, 47 To develop a realistic understanding of the replicability of standardised assays 49 in a world-leading research environment, we investigated the variation in drug 50 response data from the NCI60 screen []

 Numerical data 178 The reproducibility of results may be affected by parameters such as changes 183 in the reagents, e

 use of different lots or batches, different experimenters, and 184 using cell lines at different passages [,-]
 Hence, experiments performed 185 closely together may be expected to display greater similarity than experiments 186 performed at more distant points in time during the decades of anti-cancer 187 To investigate the effects of the time of testing on data variability, we 189 compared experiments performed in the same month to control samples of the same 190 size that were randomly selected across the whole testing period
 For this analysis, 191 we used the 18 FDA-approved drugs that were tested at least 100 times in at least 192 one cell line over periods of 95 to 275 months (Figure 3A, Extended Data Table 13), 193 resulting in 51,872 drug/cell line combinations and in total 321,709 experiments 194 For every set of experiments performed on the same date, we generated 196 1,000 random control samples of the same size and compared the value distribution
 197 The variability of GI50 fold changes for same date experiments was indeed lower 198 than for random control samples, but remained very high reaching up to 
74 x 108 199 (Figure 3C, Extended Data Table )
 Moreover, for 45% of  the same date drug/ cell 200 line combinations the GI50 fold change was higher than the mean fold change of the 201 corresponding 1,000 random samples (Figure 3D, Extended Data Table )

 230 Finally, we determined GI50 outliers for compound/cell line combinations with 233 5 or more experiments (738 compounds, 30,212 compound/cell line combinations, 234 598,243 GI50 values) using the adjusted boxplot method []
 
7% (34,216) of GI50 235 values were outliers and 
7% (13,208/30,212) of compound/cell line combinations 236 had at least one GI50 outlier (Extended Data Table )
 This indicates that outliers 237 are not responsible for the observed variability of GI50 in the majority (
3%) of 238 The highest percentage of outliers was 50% (7/14 experiments for maytansine 240 in DU-145 prostate cancer cells) (Figure 3G, Extended Data Table )

 A significant correlation was observed between 253 experiment number and maximum GI50 fold change with a Spearman correlation of 254

47 (p < 
2 x 10-16) 256 Cancer cell lines may display substantial changes in genotype and phenotype 260 over time [,]
 Hence, part of the variability observed in drug sensitivity may be 261 the consequence of a shift in drug response over time
 To investigate this, we 262 established timelines of the GI50 values for the 18 compounds, which had been 263 tested at least 100 times in one or more cell lines
 This resulted in time lines for 1080 264 compound/cell line combinations with time frames ranging from 95 months 265 Drug/ cell line combinations, in which the fold change between the mean GI50 268 on the first experimental date and the mean GI50 on the last experimental date was 269 50% or greater than the maximum GI50 fold change for the data points in between 270 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    were considered as candidates for a drift in drug sensitivity
 Only six (
56%) out of 271 1080 drug/cell line combinations fulfilled these criteria (Figure 4, Extended Data 272 The distribution of the individual GI50 values for three of the drug/ cell line 274 549) did not indicate a GI50 shift over time (Figure 4A-C, Extended Data Table 21, 276 Extended Data Table )
 For the other three drug/ cell line combinations 277 (vinblastine/ T-47D, bleomycin/ K-562, M-AMSA/ MDA-MB-435) a drift in sensitivity 278 appears unlikely but cannot be excluded based on the data (Figure 4D-E, Extended 279 Data Table 21, Extended Data Table )
 However, such observations are very rare
 280 Moreover, a phenotypic drift in a cell line would be expected to result in changes in 281 sensitivity to more than one drug over time
 Hence, the data provide no evidence 282 suggesting that the drug sensitivity of individual cell lines may have changed over 283 time

 ;    To gain real-life insights into the extent of data variability in a standardised 298 research environment, we here investigated the variation of GI50 values indicating 299 drug sensitivity for compounds that had been tested multiple times in the NCI60 300 panel
 The variation was large with the highest fold change between the lowest and 301 highest GI50 in a given compound/cell line combination being 
16 x 
 As might 302 have been expected, the fold change between the lowest and the highest GI50 in a 303 specific compound cell line combination increased with the number of experiments 304 CellMiner contains data on experimental compounds as well as on FDA-306 approved drugs that are in clinical use [,-]
 Although FDA-approved drugs 307 might have been expected to result in more robust data, this was not the case and 308 they displayed a similar data variability as that determined across all compounds
 309 The variability also remained very high when we only considered experiments that 310 Given that the NCI60 uses highly standardised methods, a high variability of 312 assay results appears to be an intrinsic feature of lab experiments
 The large range 313 of GI50 values observed for anti-cancer drugs is of potential relevance, given that 314 cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs are typically used at maximum tolerated doses that 315 cannot be further increased without unacceptable toxicity [-]
 Moreover, the 316 maximum effects of targeted drugs, e
 g
 antibodies or kinase inhibitors that interfere 317 with cancer-specific structures or entities, do not further increase beyond the optimal 318 biological dose, i
 e
 the dose at which the biological target is completely inhibited 319 [-]
 Hence, even a two-fold difference in the GI50, which occurred in 25,496 320 (
4%) of 30,212 compound/cell line combinations with at least five experiments, is 321 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 327 However, such knowledge has not penetrated into scientific discourse
 Many 328 authors promote strict standardisation of experimental procedures as a strategy to 329 Our analysis of NCI60 data, which is of unprecedented depth and provided by 331 variation remains very high even under ideal conditions that the vast majority of 333 research groups will not be able to afford
 Hence, our data suggest that experiment 334 heterogenization, the testing of a hypothesis in many different (experimental) 335 systems and datasets and different laboratories [72-79], is a much better strategy to 336 In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates that the variation of experimental 338 data is extremely high even under optimal conditions in a world-leading environment 339 applying the highest standards
 This shows that increased standardisation is not a 340 straightforward way to resolve issues associated with limited replicability
 Hence, 341 increased data robustness will have to include additional strategies such as 342 independent replication and experiment heterogenization, i

 These experimental groupings 400 enabled comparison of GI50 fold change statistics (mean, median, minimum, 401 maximum, variance) for compound/cell line combinations between lower and higher 402  All compounds that were classed as FDA-approved drugs by the NCI-60 in 406 CellMiner Database Version 
2 and where two or more experiments had been 407 performed were extracted from the complete dataset
 This created an FDA-approved 408 dataset of 181 drugs for which 399,686 experiments for 9,970 individual drug/cell line 409 combinations were performed
 Analysis of relationship between the number of 410 experiments/concentration ranges and maximum GI50 fold change for drug/cell line 411 combinations was performed as for the complete dataset, described above
 412  Month and year of each experiment was available so experimental timelines 415 were established for compounds by calculating the time between the first and last 416 experiment date
 Multiple experiments were carried out on the same date for many 417 of the compound/cell line combinations, particularly the 18 compounds with at least 418 one cell line with 100 total experiments
 The data for these 18 compounds, 17 of 419 which were FDA-approved, was extracted from the complete dataset to create a 420 subset of data deemed suitable to compare GI50 variability on the same date with 421  The maximum GI50 fold change on each date where there were multiple 423 experiments for a compound/cell line combination were calculated by dividing 424 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 The number of experiments on a specific 425 date for a compound/cell line combination was used to determine the maximum GI50 426 fold change over the same number of experiments picked randomly from that 427 combinations experimental timeline
 This was performed 1000 times so that for 428 every compound/cell line combination and experimental date with a maximum GI50 429 fold change over multiple experiments there were 1000 corresponding maximum 430 GI50 fold changes calculated from random samples of the same number of 431 experiments on that compound/cell line combinations timeline
 The mean maximum 432 GI50 fold change was calculated for the 1000 random samples for each 433 compound/cell line combination and the number of maximum GI50 fold changes for 434 experiments on the same date higher and lower than the random sample mean were 435 counted
 For each compound, significance of the difference between same date 436 maximum GI50 fold change and sample mean GI50 fold change was calculated 437 using Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test
 This was performed using all cell line data 438 combined for each compound and for each cell line individually for each compound
 439 Where a significant difference between same date and random sample mean 440 maximum GI50 fold changes were observed, the number of times the same date 441 GI50 fold change was higher or lower than the random sample mean maximum GI50 442  The mean GI50 fold change was calculated for each experimental date 446 (month) for the 18 compounds with 100 or more experiments for at least one cell 447 line
 The GI50 fold change between the first experimental date and the last 448 experimental date was calculated using the mean GI50 on those dates
