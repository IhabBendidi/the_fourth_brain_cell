 Nonhemorrhagic ventriculomegaly is associated with increased risks of measurements have been used, there is no concensus on which  measurements or cutoff values should be applied
 This problem is about preterm infants who do not experience cranial bleeding or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) because this pathologies should be evaluated seperately
 Previous studies showed that the ventricular-brain ratio is another way of estimation brain volume in association with head circumference and widths of lateral ventricular horns ()
 There is some evidence about a good correlation between ultrasonographic measurements and magnetic resonance imaging for volume of ventricles for preterm infants ()
 Brain volume of preterm infants is an important factor that has an computerized tomography is not a routine advanced imaging technique for preterm infants Furthermore transfontanel ultrasonography is the simplest method to assess preterm brain, appropriate for scanning, easy to use, accessible and even could be found in low resource settings ()
 We hypothesized that we can calculate the absolute brain volume by subtracting the ventricular volumes from the total brain volume measured and calculated with two Consequently the main aim of this study was to measure 2D distances obtained by not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 This perinatal center has a NICU with 130 beds and 18,000 birth per year
 During the study period (January 2017- May 2018) 341 infants were born under 1500 gr and 32 weeks of gestational age
 Of these 341 infants, 55 died within the first week, 41 were small for gestational age, 72 had Grade III-IV cranial bleeding, 12 had prominent periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), 40 patient dropped out because of, lost follow up (18), declined participation (14) and died (8) before the last examination (34 weeks of gestational age)
 A total of remaining 121 infants were eligible for all serial cranial ultrasound examinations (Figure )

 Routine radiologic cranial ultrasonographic examinations were also made by consultant radiologist unaware of this study
 Radiologists did not measured all measurements as we did except ventricular index
 We have to do our last scanning in NICU at 34 weeks of gestational age because most of the patients were discharged near 34th week
 Ultrasound was focused on finding IVH (grading according to Papile et al,[8]) and PVL
 Cystic periventricular leukomalacia was defined as multiple cysts with a typical region in the posterior periventricular white matter near to lateral aspect of the trigone of lateral ventricle and in the white matter adjacent to the foramen of Monro

 Previous studies showed that a linear measurement of VI for a preterm infant The three cerebral caliber considered for the model (Figure 2A) were half of the intracranial bi-parietal diameter (R1 = BPDia / 2), intracranial postero-anterior or fronto-occipital diameter (R2 = APD / 2) and cranial height (R3 = ICH / )
 Bone and extracerebral space were not included in these measurements in our study
 The transvers plane of the cranium at the level of the maximal occipital-frontal circumference was considered an ellipse for area estimation (area =  X R1 X R2); the cranium was considered as an ellipsoid for volume estimation (volume = 4/3 X  X R1 X R2 X R)()
 Lateral ventricles are reverse C shaped, asymmetric formations
 Ventricular volume can be measured by 2D or 3D dimensional ultrasound (3,13,14) and magnetic resonance imaging
 We calculated estimated ventricular volume as calculating volume of a truncated cone which is confirmed mathematically
 The small radii is represented by anterior horn width (AHW), the big radii was thalamo-occipital distance (TOD) and the height of the cone was APD (Figure B)
 Each ventricle measured and calculated seperately beacuse of assymetry
 All measured distances are explained in Table 1 and Figure

 Mean gestational age of study population (n=121) was 27,7 weeks (23-31), and mean birthweight was 1057 g (-)
 Fifty four  (44,6%) of 121 were male, 94 (77%) were delivered via cesarean section
 Mean CRIB score was 4 (1-13), 22 (18,2 %) had dilated ventricle, 51 (42%) of these infants had advanced resuscitation, 50 (41%) received parenteral nutrition more than two weeks, 49 (40%) infants reached their birthweights more than two weeks, 48 (39%) had some experience about feeding intolerance, 54 (44%) had clinically suspected late onset sepsis, 40 (33%) had moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia
 We also compared clinical characteristics of infants with and without dilated ventricle (Table )
  After adjusting data with gestational age and birthweight, resuscitation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and late onset sepsis were independent risk factors for low brain volume and NHVD (Table )

 ;    data suggests that brain volume could be calculated by 2D ultrasonographic distances and this is the most easiest way to observe preterm infants estimated absolute brain volume
 Even in low resource settings, cranial ultrasonography is the main neuroimaging method that has low cost, easy to use, safe and simple
 Ventriculomegaly alone is an important issue for preterm infants and associated with poor neurologic outcome ()
 We can say that the larger ventricle, the smaller brain tissue and this is associated with poorer neurologic outcome (15) so that brain tissue volume of preterm infants is also another way of predicting neurologic In many studies, low brain volume is associated with morbidites and neurodevelopmental impairment (,)
 All preterm infants should be evaluated for cranial pathologies, screening is recommended for preterm infants under 30 weeks of gestational once between 7 and 14 days of age and should be optimally repeated between 36 and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and this is recommended by American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Neurology and many other national medical societies ()
 There is no recommendation that all preterms under 1500 gr or less than 32 weeks of gestational age should undergo advanced neuroimaging such as cranial tomography and/or cranial MRI except additional clues like malformations of central nervous system and PVL
 Therfore very preterm infants with less morbidites and minor complications do not undergo routine advanced neuroimaging in many NICUs but they usually have at least a cranial US scan
  The ventricular index is one of the important parameter to diagnose or scan ventricular dilation
 Previous studies published  nomogram for the VI in newborns (,)
 Both data showed that upper limit of VI depends on gestational week
 The reference values of these studies correlate well for term and near term neonates, while those for very low birth weight not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    newborns show more variation
 This may be associated that the lower the post-menstrual age the fewer infants were studied, increase the error of mean
 Liao et al studied preterm infants near 26-27 weeks of gestation, who are at risk of developing ventricular dilation ()
 Additionally only evaluation of anterior horn and VI is not enough to say ventricular dilation or reduced brain volume
 Therefore more data and new techniques are needed especially for Another important measurement is anterior horn width (AHW)
 In the majority of newborns, the AHW is less than 3 mm (,-)
 The clinical importance of an AHW more than 3 mm in the absence of bleeding is not obvious
 An AHW between 3 and 5 mm was not associated with neurodevelopmental impairment at a follow up visit in a group of thirteen babies within the first year of life ()
 Values over 6 mm, however, are associated with ventricular distension and suggest the need for surgical treatment according to Govaert et al and may be associated with reduced brain volume in the absence of cranial-ventricular hemorrhage ()
 The other main measurement of preterm ventricle is TOD
  Controversy also exists whether normal values of occipital horn size and TOD depend on gestational week
 Furthermore, the variation in reported reference curves is remarkable ()
 Reeder and friends reported that (22) regardless of the degree of prematurity, an occipital horn length larger than 16 mm suggests main cerebral problmes in premature infants
 Davies and friends (11) reported much higher reference ranges for  TOD in preterm neonates, with an upper limit of 
7 mm
 One of the other issue about brain measurements of preterm infant is ventricular asymmetry
 During brain growth ventricular asymmetry may be infulenced by genetic and environmental factors (,)
 It has also been documented that in case of ventricular asymmetry, ventricle dilation is frequently associated with a bigger ipsilateral choroid plexus
 In previous studies, relationship was found between asymmetric ventricle and mode of delivery, gender and the not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Extracerebral space is another parameter should be taken into consideration for brain volume
 Some infants have large extracerebral space in our study but we did not calculate additional volume for extracerebral space
 In our study, intracranial measurements started at the margin Ventricular/brain ratio and lateral ventricular diameter are also investigated for assessing brain volume and predicting neurologic outcome ()
 The authors concluded that the ventricular/ brain ratio, size of the lateral ventricles, and head circumference are suitable measures for the estimation of total and regional brain volumes and  this study confirmed that As we observed that each of measurements are associated with ventricular dilation seperately and all have some predictive power for assessing brain volume
 We hypothesized that a calculation which covers all these parameters will give a more proper information about preterm brain volume
 We suggest that sonographers and clinicans should make all these measurements as they do before and enter these data to a computer based system and could Of course there are some limitations of this study
 One of them is we could not confirm these calculations by MRI or similar advanced neuroimaging techniques
 But this should not be a major shortcoming because further studies and measurements may be established with these ultrasonographic measurements and next years more infants may be evaluated and percentiles and larger databases would be added on these data shortly
 In future studies infants will have only ultrasonographic measurements even if they do not have any additional intracranial Another limitation is the timing of last ultrasonographic assessment which is at 34 weeks of gestational age
 Our plan was to make a scan at 36 or 40 weeks of gestational age but this will not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 We did not change the discharge time of infants because of our study protocol and this would be an intervention and would not be ethical  We do not know EABV is associated or related with neurologic outcome
 We will follow up these patients and will be sharing neurodevelopmental results of our cohort as soon as Additionally there is no other clinican and/or radiologist doing all ultrasonographic measurements except ventricular index to assess an interobserver difference, this is also Anyway this method is safe, effective, easy to use and an applicable model for estimating preterm brain volume
 As a conclusion, absolute brain volume could be calculated and measurements could be entered a database and/or computer base programme and may give more proper and reliable information about brain volume without any risk or workload in not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
