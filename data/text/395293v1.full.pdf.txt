 Patients who fulfilled all inclusion criteria were eligible to participate in this study
 Exclusion criteria included 1) shoulder deformity, 2) complete rotator cuff tear, 3) the diagnosis of cervical spine nerve root impingement, 4) recent trauma, 5) hemorrhagic diathesis, 6) use of warfarin or other anticoagulants, 7) the presence of infection, or 8) previous 30 patients were randomized to either 1) glenohumeral injection guided by anatomic shoulders)
 All injections and ultrasound examinations in both groups were performed by experienced traditional (anatomic landmark) and ultrasound-trained proceduralists
 As this was a practical study meant to resemble clinical practice, neither the patient nor proceduralist was blinded to ultrasound versus palpation; thus, a mock ultrasound procedure was not performed in controls
  Mock ultrasound deviates from normal practice and may induce a consistent procedural error because the shoulder is injected with one hand while the other hand operates the ultrasound transducer, when in normal practice the proceduralist uses 2 hands to perform a landmark procedure
 The physician who determined post-procedural outcomes was blinded to the intervention (ultrasound vs
 landmark)
  Study groups were similar in terms of gender, age, and baseline pain (Table )
 100% of participants completed the study
  Participant pain was measured with the standardized and validated 0-10 cm Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS), where 0 cm = no pain and 10 cm = unbearable pain and

 A printed VAS was given to the patient to rate the pain before and during the procedures
  The operating physicians recorded the pre-procedural and procedural pain
   A VAS was given to the patient to take home after the procedure
 The patient was then contacted by a physician blinded to treatment (ultrasound versus landmark) to obtain the VAS scores at 2 weeks and 6 months and the patient related the VAS scale to the inquirer while the patient looked at the VAS scale at home
  Therapeutic duration (duration of therapeutic response or time to flare) was defined as the time interval in months when the shoulder became symptomatic (VAS  5 cm) after the injection
 The patient emailed or called when the shoulder became symptomatic again
 No patients were permitted a second injection of the shoulder prior to 3 months after the first injection; however, after 3 months the patient determined the timing of the next shoulder injection
    If the shoulder remained asymptomatic at 6 months or longer, the duration was defined as 6 months
  Time-to-next-intervention in this study corresponds to the time to the next injection and thus the time-to-next-intervention permits least cost determinations related to injection therapy (-)
  In the present series, the next intervention in each case was reinjection with corticosteroid
 During the time of the study no patients underwent shoulder surgery or advanced imaging, but most received a second injection within the 12-month period
  Time-to-next-intervention was determined up to 12 months after the initial injection and expressed in months

 The one-needle two-syringe technique was used where 1) one needle is used for anesthesia and corticosteroid injection; 2) the first syringe is used to anesthetize the shoulder and perform arthrocentesis, and 3) the second syringe is used to inject the corticosteroid therapy (,)

 Similarly, Bloom and Buchbinder and colleagues have recently reviewed the literature regarding ultrasound-guided shoulder injections and found that although ultrasound-guided injections are more accurate, that injection into a distant region is equally effective suggesting that a non-intraarticular systemic or regional lymphatic spread of the steroid is equally effective ()
 Further, Dogu et al found that ultrasound -guidance and anatomic landmark injections of the subacromial joint result in identical outcomes, similar to the present report in the glenohumeral joint ()
  Ekeberg et al demonstrated no difference in reduction of pain and disability in subacromial shoulder pain after 6 weeks in groups injected in the subacromial space with US versus a group getting gluteal injection ()
 Oh et al reported the same result for frozen shoulder with US guided injection in the subacromial space versus the glenohumeral joint ()
  It is known that once corticosteroid crystals are injected in the soft tissues in the proximity to an intended injection target that the corticosteroid can move via lymphatics or systemically, which may explain why exact accuracy is not always necessary ()

   Although sonographically directed procedures were superior in therapeutic duration and the time-to-next-intervention (Table 2), sonographic image guidance for injection of the shoulder increased the costs per patient per year by 
6% ($17), thus, modestly decreasing cost-effectiveness (Table 2) (10-12, )
  However, this difference is cost is rather small, and may not be significant if other health benefits are associated with ultrasound guidance

  McAlindon et al used an intensive regimen of triamcinolone injections administered intraarticularly into the knee every 3 months for 2 years and found that this regimen resulted in significantly more cartilage loss than control saline injections, a finding that has been confirmed in subsequent epidemiologic studies (,)
  These same studies have not been completed in the shoulder to date, but are likely a to be similar ()
  Thus, a technique like ultrasound guidance that might result in fewer corticosteroid injections per year might mitigate these deleterious corticosteroid effects on  There are recognizable limitations to the above analyses
 Firstly, the study was relatively small with 30 shoulders, and all patients in the study were older female adults owing to the demographics of this clinical population
 Power calculations indicated that the same results would be obtained at 2 weeks if the total population were increased to over 1000 shoulders, again emphasizing how similar the responses were between ultrasound-guided and landmark-guided techniques

  In the palpation guided anatomic landmark technique with the forearm held relaxed in the patients lap, first the acromioclavicular joint and the coracoid process are palpated and marked
  The medial border of the humeral is then was then palpated and marked
 The needle was introduced horizontally parallel to the floor on the lateral side of the coracoid through the ligaments and joint capsule into the glenohumeral joint with care not to Figure 
 Ultrasound identification of the glenohumeral joint
  In the ultrasound-guided technique the linear probe is held horizontally and the coracoid process and humerus are identified
  The glenoid labrum and the glenohumeral joint are deep and between these structures
 The needle is introduced out of plane to the probe inferiorly and laterally to the Figure 
  Probe and needle positioning
 The needle is introduced out-of-plane inferiorly and laterally to the coracoid and then the transducer moved 90 degrees so that the needle is in-plane with the transducer using an ultrasound gel wedge to assist with in-plane positioning

  Injection of the glenohumeral joint
  The needle is introduced through the joint capsule into the glenohumeral synovial space and lidocaine injected to confirm needle positioning
 After injection of the lidocaine, the empty lidocaine syringe is detached from the needle while still in the glenohumeral joint and a 3 ml syringe prefilled with 60 mg triamcinolone acetonide suspension was attached to the indwelling needle, and the triamcinolone certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
