 ;    A variety of chemical additives are incorporated into plastics during their production 16 process to give desirable properties
 Although studies have suggested that microplastic 17 ingestion can lead to accumulation of these chemicals in marine organisms, none provided the 18 direct evidence in fish species
 Here, we demonstrated the tissue accumulation of chemical 19 additives in fish following microplastic ingestion
 We exposed fish (Myoxocephalus brandti) 20 to polyethylene microplastics compounded with brominated flame retardants (BFRs; BDE209, 21 DBDPE) and ultraviolet stabilizers (UVs; UV-234, UV-327, BP-12) suspended in the water 22 column, or to mysids (Neomysis spp
) pre-exposed to the same microplastics
 Our results 23 showed a maximum of 345-fold higher concentrations of additives in fish exposed to 24 microplastics than the ambient sample
 Also, fish fed plastic-exposed mysids accumulated 25 significantly greater concentrations of BFRs in muscle than fish exposed to microplastics 26 suspended in the water column (p < 
 )
 This indicates that trophic transfer of microplastics 27 has greater contribution to tissue accumulation of BFRs in fish than the waterborne ingestion
 28 In contrast, no significant difference in the accumulation of UVs was found between the 29 treatments, except for UV-327 in liver
 These results suggests that the relative contribution 30 between direct ingestion of microplastics from the water column and indirect ingestion via 31 trophic transfer on tissue accumulation of additives in fish varies among compounds
 32 Compounds with high molecular weight and high hydrophobicity like BDE209 and DBDPE 33 were considered difficult to leach out from plastics, however, our study showed that trophic 34 transfer of microplastics can facilitate the accumulation of such compounds from plastics to 35 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;     As plastic production has been increasing over the years, plastic debris have become 43 ubiquitous pollutants found throughout marine environments (Auta et al, 2017; Burns and 44 Boxall, 2018; Desforges et al, 2014; Duis and Coors, )
 Especially, plastic particles 45 smaller than 5 mm called microplastics are concerned as an emerging pollutant in marine 46 ecosystems (NOAA, )
 Their small size allows a variety of organisms to ingest such as 47 whales, seabirds, fish, and invertebrates (Auta et al, 2017; Cole et al, 2013; Rummel et al, 48 2016; Zhang et al, )
 Many studies have shown that ingesting microplastics can cause 49 negative physical impacts on organisms such as blockage and laceration of the digestive tract 50 (Derraik, 2002; Khosrovyan et al, 2012; Wright et al, )
 In most cases, however, these 51 negative effects were observed with unrealistically high exposure concentration in laboratory 52 experiments (Cunningham and Sigwart, 2019; Lenz et al, 2016), and the current monitored 53 concentration in the ocean is considered to have negligible impacts on organisms because 54 microplastics can be egested from the body without long-term accumulation (Beiras and 55  Aside from their physical effects, microplastics also have chemical effects on 57 organisms
 Plastics contain an array of chemicals that are either adsorbed to the polymer 58 surface from the surrounding water or incorporated during the manufacturing process, the latter 59 called plastic additives (Andrady, 2011; Cole et al, 2011; Ziccardi et al, )
 These 60 chemicals have been shown to transfer to biological tissues following the ingestion of 61 microplastics and are concerned about their impacts on ecosystems because some of them have 62 persistent and toxic natures (Hermabessiere et al, 2017a; Wardrop et al, 2016; Ziccardi et al, 63 )
 However, some model studies suggested that plastics are not important for the 64 accumulation of these pollutants in organisms because their concentrations in plastics would 65 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    be at equilibrium with those in organisms and the chemical diffusion from plastics to organisms 66 would not occur (Gouin et al, 2011; Koelmans et al, )
 In contrast, microplastics may 67 play a more relevant role in the transfer of chemical additives as they are added to plastic 68 polymers at high concentrations (~80% by weight (Gangi, 1999)), whereas the information 69 about the tissue accumulation of additives compounded in plastics is still far limited 70 compared to that of adsorbed pollutants
 A recent study by Tanaka et al (2020) demonstrated 71 that the ingestion of plastics resulted in the tissue accumulation of chemical additives in seabird
 72 While no study has so far provided the direct evidence that microplastic ingestion can lead to 73 the tissue accumulation of chemicals additives in fish species, Coffin et al (2019) demonstrated 74 that in vivo fish gut simulated condition using the digestive enzyme enhanced the leaching of 75 additives from plastics, which suggests that tissue accumulation in fish species is plausible
 76 Studies using fish species are especially important considering the food web structure of marine 77 ecosystems and the potential impact on human health through direct consumption (Campanale 78  There are two possible pathways for predatory fish to ingest microplastics, either from 80 the water column or their prey (Walkinshaw et al, )
 Most microplastic exposure studies 81 focus either on waterborne or dietary exposure, but none of them compared their relative 82 contribution to the total ingestion
 Our prior work compared the waterborne ingestion of 83 microplastics and the trophic transfer using fish and mysids, and revealed that the trophic 84 transfer is more important than the waterborne ingestion (Hasegawa and Nakaoka, )
 If 85 microplastic ingestion by fish leads to tissue transfer of plastic-derived chemicals, fish may 86 receive more impacts on the exposure of those chemicals via trophic transfer of microplastics 87  The present study aims to examine the tissue accumulation of chemical additives in 89 fish following microplastic exposure and the relative contribution of the waterborne and trophic 90 transfer exposure on the accumulation

 We conducted the exposure experiments using 93 BDE209, DBDPE) and three ultraviolet stabilizers (UVs; UV-234, UV327, BP-)
 To 95 examine the relative importance of the two exposure pathways, we exposed the fish to 96 polyethylene microplastics suspended in the water column or to mysids pre-exposed to 97 polyethylene microplastics, and analyzed the concentration of each additive in fish muscle and 98 liver
 We hypothesized that the fish would accumulate the additives following microplastic 99 ingestion and that trophic transfer of microplastics would yield the greater accumulation of the 100  We collected organisms for the experiment on September 7, 2020 at a seagrass bed in 105 Akkeshi-ko estuary (4302 N, 14452 E), which is located in eastern Hokkaido, northern 106 Japan

 For the measurement of contaminant concentrations in the ambient 110 environment, 90 mysids and three fish were immediately frozen and stored until the later 111 chemical analysis, and the other fresh animals were brought to the laboratory for the 112 experiments
 Mysids were acclimated in 30-L aquaria overnight with flow-through seawater 113 that were filtered by fine sand to allow them clear possible microplastics from their guts
 Ten 114 glass aquaria (245165160 mm) were prepared and one randomly selected fish was assigned 115 to each aquarium, and then acclimated for 7 days prior to the start of the experiment

 Each aquarium contained approximately 100 mysids or 20 fish
 118  We used cylindrical low-density polyethylene pellets (diameter 5 mm, length 5 mm; 121 DJK Corporation, Chiba, Japan) compounded with five plastic additives
 Polyethylene is one 122 of the most produced plastic polymers and is commonly found in marine environments 123 (Andrady, 2011; Beiras et al, 2018; Burns and Boxall, )
 Following five additives were 124 widely used in plastic products and electrical appliances as flame retardants and are suspected 131 to be non-readily degradable and have long-term toxicity (Hermabessiere et al, 2017b; NITE, 132 )
 UV-234, UV-324 and BP-12 are also commonly added to plastic products as UV-133 stabilizers, which have the potential for bioaccumulation and toxicity on organisms (Kim et al, 134 2011; Nakata et al, )
 These compounds were selected as previous studies reported their 135 frequent occurrences in plastic debris collected in natural environments and marine organisms 136 (Rani et al, 2015; Rochman et al, 2014; Tanaka et al, )
 The concentration of each 137 additive in the pellets was set below 
04 % by weight, which is of the same order of magnitude 138 as those observed in these studies

 The pellets were then melted and re-extruded twice to obtain a uniform distribution of 143 the constituents
 The pellets were further grinded into powders by a plastic cutting mill (PLC-144 2M, Osaka Chemical Co
, Ltd
, Osaka, Japan) and the powders were sieved over a 63 m and 145 32 m mesh
 Particles left on the 32 m sieve were collected and used for the experiments
  146  For measurement of the particle size, the quantification method with nile red was 147 adapted from Erni-Cassola et al (2017) using a nylon mesh filter with 8 m pore size
 Particle 148 area was measured, and the square root was calculated as particle size
 The targeted 149 polyethylene microplastics had an average size of

 The concentrations of five additives in polyethylene microplastics were 151 quantified (Table 1) and the composition of each additive is shown in Fig
 
 152  To prepare the microplastic-suspended solution, a glass beaker was filled with 100 mL 153 of distilled water and boiled in a microwave
 Ten microliters of surfactant (Tween 80; 154 polyethylene sorbitol ester, Cospheric LLC) were added and stirred with a glass rod for 30 s
 155 Next, 5 mL of the solution was transferred to another grass beaker filled with 95 mL of boiled 156 distilled water to make 
004 % surfactant solution
 The solution was left at room temperature 157 for 1 h
 Before starting the exposure experiment, 8 mg of polyethylene microplastics were 158 added to a plastic tube containing 8 mL of

 We 167 constantly circulated the seawater by aeration during the test
 After 24 h, the seawater was 168 transferred to a 1-L stainless container and stored in the freezer until the chemical analysis
 169  Thirty 1-L glass beakers were prepared and divided into the following two groups; 172 fifteen bottles filled with 1-L filtered seawater (< 1 m) containing 500-g/L microplastics, 173 and 15 bottles filled with 1-L leachate seawater
 The microplastic concentration was chosen as 174 an environmentally relevant concentration as it is within the same order of magnitude of the 175 microplastic concentration reported in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, which is among the 176 most heavily contaminated area around the world (Goldstein et al, )
 Leachate seawater 177 was prepared by filtering 1-L filtered seawater (< 1 m) containing 500-g/L microplastics to 178 determine the uptake of the chemicals leaching from microplastics during the experiment by 179 mysids
 We randomly selected mysids from the acclimation aquaria and placed three in each 180 bottle
 We then fed the mysids 2 mg (dry weight) of microalgae
 We constantly circulated the 181 seawater by aeration to ensure that the microplastics were evenly distributed in the bottles
 182 After 24 h of microplastic exposure, the mysids were flushed gently with filtered seawater to 183 remove beads from the exoskeleton and their body length and wet weight were measured
 Then, 184 the mysids were frozen at - 30 and stored until the later analysis
 The same procedure was 185 repeated 4 days to collect 150 mysids in total from each group except that only 15 mysids in 186  After the acclimation for fish, ten fish aquaria were divided into the following two 190 groups: Five aquaria contained 2-L filtered seawater (< 1 m) with a 500-g/L microplastic 191 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Five other aquaria each contained nine mysids that 193 had been pre-exposed to 500-g/L microplastics
 The five aquaria containing pre-exposed 194 mysids were filled with 2-L filtered seawater (1 m) without a microplastic suspension so that 195 uptake of polyethylene microplastics would be solely from the food source
 The number of 196 mysids was determined from a preliminary experiment to ensure that all mysids were consumed 197 by the fish within 24 h
 Pre-exposure of the mysids followed the protocol for the first 198 experiment
 We carried out the exposure for 10 days and exchanged the seawater once a day
 199 We constantly circulated the seawater by aeration throughout the experiment to ensure that 200 microplastics were evenly distributed in the aquaria
 We did not observe any microplastics on 201 the bottom of the tanks throughout the experiment

 322  Concentration of five additives accumulated in mysids significantly differed among 325 treatments (Table )
 Mysids contained approximately 4-2450 times higher concentrations of 326 additives by ingesting microplastics than those from the ambient environment (Fig

 Mysids 327 treated with the leachate seawater also showed slightly elevated concentrations of additives 328 than those from the ambient environment
 For BP-12, the concentration in mysids treated with 329 the leachate seawater was not significantly different from those exposed to microplastics
  330  Concentration of the five additives in fish varied significantly among treatments 333 (Table 5) although the patterns of variation greatly differed among additives and between body 334 For BFRs, the treatment had significant effects on their concentrations both in muscle 336 and liver

 Unlike BDE209 and DBDPE, however, no significant differences were 356 found between the mysid and water treatments
 In liver, UV-234 and UV-327 respectively 357 showed 9-13 fold and 35-89 fold higher concentration in the treatment groups than the ambient 358 controls, and also the concentration of UV-327 in the mysid treatment was significantly higher 359 than that in the water treatment
 While BP-12 showed 3-fold higher concentration in the mysid 360 treatment than the ambient control, the concentration in the water treatment was not 361 significantly different from both the mysid treatment and the ambient control
 In general, liver 362 showed the higher concentrations of UVs in liver than muscle in both treatments, whereas the 363 accumulation tendency between the tissues greatly differed among the chemicals
 For example, 364 UV-234 showed the greatest increase in liver compared to muscle among UVs (Water: 29-fold, 365 Mysid: 53-fold), whereas BP-12 only showed 7-fold increase in the water treatment and 13-366 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    This study provides the first evidence that microplastic ingestion leads to the tissue 370 accumulation of chemical additives in fish
 We also revealed that trophic transfer of 371 microplastics enhanced the accumulation of BFRs in fish muscle compared to the waterborne 372 ingestion
 However, as we observed the equal contribution to the accumulation of UVs between 373 direct ingestion of microplastics from the water column and indirect ingestion via trophic 374 Previous studies showed that microplastics can act as a vector for the transfer of 376 plastic-associated chemicals to marine organisms, but mostly targeted at the environmental 377 contaminants adsorbed onto plastics, such as PCBs and PAHs (Besseling et al, 2013; Rochman 378 et al, )
 However, some model prediction studies pointed out that microplastics would not 379 increase the body burden of these contaminants in organisms because other input sources like 380 water and food would play a more important role in their accumulation (Bakir et al, 2016; 381 Gouin et al, 2011; Koelmans et al, )
 In contrast, plastic additives are different from 382 pollutants adsorbed to plastics with respect that they are not attached to the polymer surface, 383 but incorporated into plastics at high concentrations (Gangi, )
 Several field observation 384 studies found a positive relationship between plastic ingestion and chemical additives detected 385 from marine fish and seabirds (Gassel et al, 2013; Tanaka et al, 2013), suggesting the potential 386 occurrence of the tissue transfer of plastic-derived additives in natural environments
 Our 387 results support these evidence along with the previous finding by Tanaka et al (2020) where 388 they demonstrated that plastic ingestion led to the tissue accumulation of additives in seabird 389 (Calonectris leucomelas) by the laboratory experiment
 Gut fluid in both seabird and fish have 390 been shown to play a key role in the leaching of chemicals from plastics (Coffin et al, 2019; 391 Tanaka et al, 2015), which explains the tissue accumulation of chemical additives following 392 plastic ingestion

 ;    plastics found in natural environments (Granek et al, 2020; Wang et al, 2020), our study raises 394 a concern about the exposure of these additives to fish
 395 We found that trophic transfer of microplastics has greater effects on the accumulation 396 of BDE209 and DBDPE in fish than waterborne ingestion
 There are three possible 397 explanations for this result which are not exclusive
 First, fish was exposed to more chemical 398 additives by ingesting microplastics via trophic transfer
 Our previous study demonstrated that 399 fish ingested greater amount of microplastics via trophic transfer than the waterborne ingestion 400 (Hasegawa and Nakaoka, )
 Higher ingestion rate of microplastics via trophic transfer 401 should have resulted in the greater exposure intensity of chemical additives in fish stomach
 402 Secondly, greater secretion of gut fluid may have elevated the leaching rate of additives from 403 plastics in stomach
 Gut fluid plays a key role in leaching hydrophobic chemicals from ingested 404 plastics (Coffin et al, 2019; Tanaka et al, )
 Digesting plastic-contaminated prey could 405 facilitated the secretion of gut fluid in stomach, which may have enhanced the leaching of 406 chemicals from plastics
 Thirdly, mysids fragmented microplastics into smaller particles and 407 helped the release of chemicals from plastics
 Some crustacean species can fragment plastics 408 into smaller particles, including mysids (A
 L
 Dawson et al, 2018; Hasegawa and Nakaoka, 409 2021; Mateos-Crdenas et al, )
 Generally, smaller plastics can release chemicals more 410 easily due to their larger surface-to-volume ratio (Wright and Kelly, )
 Ingesting 411 microplastics from mysids, therefore, changed the size composition of plastics in fish stomach, 412 and may have enhanced the leaching of chemicals
 Compounds with high molecular weight 413 and high hydrophobicity such as BDE209 and DBDPE (Table 1) were considered difficult to 414 leach out from plastics and to transfer into biological tissues (Braekevelt et al, 2003; Cheng et 415 al, 2020; Sun et al, )
 However, we demonstrated the elevated accumulation of these 416 compounds in the fish by ingesting microplastics from mysids
 Thus, our study highlights the 417 importance of indirect exposure via trophic transfer in chemical effects of microplastics on 418 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Although we observed the greater accumulation of BDE209 and DBDPE via trophic 420 transfer of microplastics, the waterborne exposure equally contributed the accumulation of UV-421 327, UV-234 and BP-
 This suggests that the trend in accumulation of chemical additives 422 vary depending both on the properties of the chemicals and on exposure pathway
 Given the 423 ingestion of microplastics from the water column in fish are much lower than the trophic 424 transfer (Hasegawa and Nakaoka, 2021), there could be other accumulation routes in the 425 waterborne exposure of chemical additives
 In marine fish, there are three possible routes for 426 chemical uptake from the environment: gill uptake, dermal absorption and gut absorption by 427 drinking water (Qiao et al, )
 Although microplastic ingestion is assumed to only 428 contribute to gut absorption, gill uptake could also be important because microplastics can also 429 accumulate in gill
 Water flux in the gill of marine benthic fish Oligocottus maculosus, which 430 shares the same family of our target fish M
 brandti, by ventilation is 300-fold higher than that 431 in stomach by drinking water (Somo et al, 2020; Webb et al, )
 Also, UV-234, UV-324 432 and BP-12 are likely to leach out from plastics more easily than BDE209 and DBDPE due to 433 their lower molecular weight and less hydrophobic nature (Table )
 Considering the more 434 frequent contact with microplastics and the lower hydrophobic nature, gill may have also 435 played a role in the transfer of the UVs into fish body
 Given that mysids accumulated additives 436 leached out from plastics to the water column, fish was also likely to accumulate the additives 437 from the water column in the same manner, especially for BP-12 that showed the higher 438 leaching rate (10%) and the higher accumulation in mysids
 Although we need further 439 investigation on the mechanism that differentiates the behavior of additives depending on each 440 exposure pathway, both waterborne exposure and trophic transfer of microplastics are 441 Overall, we observed the preferential accumulation of the chemicals in liver over 443 muscle, which is consistent with the previous findings targeted at the same class of compounds 444 (Nakata et al 2009; Tanaka et al )
 However, the effect size was much smaller in BFRs 445 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

4-16 fold) than UVs (7-53 fold)
 Tanaka et al (2020) observed the totally opposite trend in 446 seabird that showed the considerably high level of accumulation for BDE209, but less for UV-447 327 and BP-12 in the liver
 This indicates the species-specific accumulation patterns even in 448 the same compounds
 Tanaka et al (2020) explained the lower accumulation of BP-12 by the 449 degradation in liver due to the susceptible nature of BP-12 to the metabolization
 In contrast, 450 BDE209 is known to be resilient to biodegradation because of their high molecular weight
 As 451 several studies showed that BDE209 and DBDPE can be readily metabolized to lower 452 brominated congeners in fish species (Chen et al, 2012; X
 Wang et al, 2019), lower 453 accumulation level for these two compounds could be explained by the metabolization
 Still, 454 we cannot fully exclude this possibility without conducting a depuration experiment to examine 455 in vivo kinetics of these chemicals
 Future studies should investigate the temporal variation of 456 chemical concentrations in different tissues to understand the fate of plastic additives in 457 Studies have demonstrated that both BFRs and UVs have negative impacts on 459 organisms (Kim et al, 2011; Morohoshi et al, 2005; X
 Wang et al, )
 Especially, 460 extensive research have been conducted for BDE209 and have shown that the compound can 461 act as an endocrine disrupter and cause neurotoxicity on fish (Sun et al, 2020; X
 Wang et al, 462 2019; Y
 Wang et al, )
 BDE209 is also concerned for the accumulation in a human body 463 because of the potential adverse health effects (Darnerud, )
 As global seafood 464 consumption has been increasing over the years, humans may be more frequently exposed to 465 such additives through seafood consumption
 A simple risk assessment of plastic additives on 466 humans through consumptions of fish can be made as follows
 First, BDE209 accumulation in 467 fish, dairy intake of BDE209 through seafood consumption was estimated based on the result 468 of BDE209 concentration in fish muscle
 Assuming annual seafood consumption of 
6 kg 469 year-1 and the average body weight of 60 kg for adult Japanese (Ministry of Agriculture, 2016; 470 Ministry of Health, 2018) and using our observed data on the mean BDE209 concentration of 471 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

70 ng/g
wet weight in fish muscle considering the both microplastic exposure pathways, dairy 472 intake of BDE209 can be estimated as 
46 ng/kg/day
 According to the report from National 473 Institute of Technology and Evaluation, lowest observed adverse effects levels (LOAEL) of 474 BDE209 is estimated as 50 ng/kg/day to induce chronic toxicity for a human (NITE, 2017), 475 which is approximately 110-fold higher than the estimated dairy intake value through seafood 476 consumption
 As our study used the environmentally relevant concentration of additives, 477 accumulation of plastic additives in fish through microplastic exposure should be negligible 478 for a human body in the current plastic pollution level of the worlds ocean
 However, current 479 study only shows the marginal results with 10-day microplastic exposure to fish
 Considering 480 a long-term exposure of microplastics to fish throughout the life, fish would accumulate far 481 more plastic-derived additives
 A study predicted the abundance of plastics in the ocean would 482 increase 50-fold by 2100 from the present condition (Everaert et al, 2018), suggesting that 483 plastic exposure through seafood consumption would provide a relevant pathway for BDE209 484 to have adverse health effects on a human in the future scenario
 We are also being exposed to 485 these additives from the daily use of plastic products
 The risk assessment study estimated a 486 daily exposure amount of BDE209 to humans from different exposure routes such as inhalation 487 of inside dusts or elution from plastic products, but did not include the exposure through 488 seafood consumption (NITE, )
 This study clearly showed the chemical accumulation in 489 fish following microplastic exposure
 Thus, these risk assessment studies should consider 490 seafood consumption as a factor for the exposure of plastic-derived chemicals to a human body
 491  This study is the first to demonstrate that microplastic ingestion can lead to tissue 494 accumulation of chemical additives in fish
 We also revealed that indirect exposure of 495 microplastics via trophic transfer can enhance the accumulation of BDE209 and DBDPE that 496 were assumed difficult to accumulate in organisms because of their low leachability from 497 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Some studies have suggested that microplastics themselves do not accumulate in the 498 body and have negligible effects on organisms because they can be excreted from the body
 499 Whereas, our findings indicate that microplastics play an important role in chemical 500 bioaccumulation
 As many chemical additives are potentially toxic, this study raises the 501 concern about their negative impacts on marine ecosystems
 To better understand the fates and 502 the effects of chemical additives accumulated in organisms, further research should examine 503 Andrady, A
