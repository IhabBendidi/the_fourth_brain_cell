 ;    Major determining factors for survival of patients with oral, oropharyngeal, and esophageal cancer are early detection, the quality of surgical margins, and the contemporaneous detection of residual tumor
 Intuitively, the exposed location at the epithelial surface qualifies these tumor types for utilization of visual aids to assist in discriminating tumor from healthy surrounding tissue
 Here, we explored the DNA repair enzyme PARP1 as imaging biomarker and conducted optical imaging in animal models, human tissues and as part of a first-in-human clinical trial Our data suggests that PARP1 is a quantitative biomarker for oral, oropharyngeal, and esophageal cancer and can be visualized with PARPi-FL, a fluorescently labeled small molecule contrast agent for topical or intravenous delivery
 We show feasibility of PARPi-FL-assisted tumor detection in esophageal cancer, oropharyngeal and oral cancer
 We developed a contemporaneous PARPi-FL topical staining protocol for human biospecimens
 Using fresh oral cancer tissues within 25 min of biopsy, tumor and margin samples were correctly identified with >95% sensitivity and specificity without terminal processing
 PARPi-FL imaging can be integrated into clinical workflows, potentially providing instantaneous assessment of the presence or absence of microscopic disease at the surgical margin
 Additionally, we showed first-in-human PARPi-FL imaging in oral cancer
 In aggregate, our preclinical and clinical studies have the unifying goal of verifying the clinical value of PARPi-FL-based optical imaging for early detection and intraoperative margin assignment

 ;    Cancers that originate in the epithelium of exposed or accessible body areas, such as oral and oropharyngeal cancers as well as esophageal cancer, should be easy to screen for by monitoring and identifying visible changes in the mucosal lining
 However, cancer registry data reveal that only 29% of oral and oropharyngeal cancers and 19% of esophageal cancers are detected at early stages, when the cancer is still confined to its primary site
 Survival rates steeply drop with detection at advanced tumor stages
 The five-year survival rate in the US is 
7% for oral cancer and 
2% for esophageal cancer when the disease is still localized at the time of diagnosis, compared to 
1% (oral cancer) and 
8% (esophageal cancer) for metastatic disease (1, )
 Clinical outcome is also negatively affected by the presence of residual tumor at the surgical margins in the postsurgical histopathology exam of the resected specimen (-)
 Intuitively, this suggests that the current clinical practice of visual examination in combination with biopsy-based histopathological diagnosis is insufficient to improve early diagnosis and consequently, to improve treatment outcomes for patients with cancers that develop close to the epithelial surface
   For initial diagnosis, identifying early-stage morphological changes and distinguishing among a variety of inflammatory and benign conditions, given their potentially similar appearance, is difficult
 During surgical interventions, success is typically dependent on the absence of positive margins and micro-metastasis
 Current clinical practice, e
 g
, for oral cancer, calls for surgical excision with at least 5 mm margins of normal tissue on histopathologic examination to reduce the risk of residual microscopic disease
 Wide margins, however, can lead to additional morbidity and Therefore, the current surgical paradigm consists of the surgeon arbitrarily removing at least 10 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Following excision of the tumor, frozen section histopathology is often used to evaluate the presence of tumor cells at the surgical margins
 However, this approach leads to significant time delays during surgery and has less accuracy than the gold standard permanent histopathology due to tissue artifacts caused by the freezing process
 Frozen section histopathology is also afflicted by high false-negative ratesintuitively, a direct consequence of the small sampling volume used for sectioning
 Lastly, action is delayed several days until the definitive histopathological diagnosis is available, often leading to secondary surgeries and/or adjuvant treatment with radiation and chemotherapy, which are all associated with compounded morbidity, further cost, and poorer Enhancing the visibility of malignant lesions in relation to normal tissues contemporaneouslychallenges associated with diagnosis and intraoperative imaging
 In pursuit of this goal, a host of methods have been explored as clinical diagnostic adjuncts, including tissue staining with vital dyes (e
 g
, Toluidine Blue, Methylene Blue, or Lugols Iodine), chemiluminescence imaging following an acetic acid wash, and optical-based imaging techniques, which rely on autofluorescence (-)
 To date, these methods have shown limited sensitivity and/or specificity A new class of emerging diagnostic adjuncts focuses on in vivo microscopic (IVM) techniques

 Currently, IVM techniques for epithelial cancers are in early-stage development and their diagnostic accuracy remains to be determined
 Thus, existing approaches possess limitations that have prevented their clinical adoption
 Those limitations are i) absence of a tumor-specific molecular target, ii) confinement to either microscopic or macroscopic resolution iii) diagnostic accuracy that is limited by either low sensitivity or low specificity (6, 7, -)
 In contrast, employing the optically active, molecularly targeted approach presented in this work could not only improve sensitivity and specificity of tumor recognition, but also allow for imaging on both the cellular and macroscopic level, which, if combined, could increase the breadth and depth of the molecular information used for early The molecular target for our optical imaging approach is the DNA repair enzyme Poly(ADP-ribose)Polymerase 1 (PARP)
 In addition to its many functions in cell cycle regulation and transcription, high levels of PARP1 expression have been observed in many different tumor types, indicating its potential for diagnostic applications (-)
 Higher expression has moreover been linked to worse prognosis (-)
 While PARP1 also appears in the nuclei of normal, proliferating cells, expression levels and especially cellularity tend to be lower than in rapidly growing tumors, supporting the rationale that high-contrast imaging can be achieved with PARP-targeted imaging The optical PARP1-targeted imaging agent PARPi-FL is a fluorescently labeled analog of the FDA-approved PARP inhibitor olaparib with high affinity and specificity for PARP1 ()

 ;    Importantly, compared to other nuclear staining vital dyes, PARPi-FL does not intercalate into the DNA, but instead reversibly binds to PARP1, which locates to DNA strand breaks, and is not mutagenic, enabling in vivo applications in addition to ex vivo applications
 The efficacy of high-contrast xenograft imaging with PARPi-FL after intravenous application has been shown on the whole body as well as at the cellular level (25, )
 Importantly, the tissue penetrating nature of PARPi-FL enables its use as both a systemic and topical agent
 Topical application, as an alternative to intravenous injection, enables the application of microdoses of PARPi-FL and allows for almost immediate imaging ()
 However, this concept has neither been tested systematically nor was it tested in humans
 The versatile features of PARPi-FL make it a tool for use in early detection as well as surgical margin assignment applications, both of which could strongly benefit Oral and oropharyngeal cancer as well as esophageal cancers typically grow at the epithelial surface
 For all three, tumors are currently inspected by visual examination, followed by incisional biopsy without visual aids
 We hypothesized that these malignancies would benefit most from PARP1-targeted optical imaging to improve tumor detection and increase the accuracy of tumor excision
 The goal of the latter is to increase surgical success by facilitating contemporaneous In this study, we aimed to characterize the potential of PARP1 expression as a quantitative biomarker for early detection and intraoperative delineation in human biospecimens and to models

 In oropharyngeal cancer, we tested whether combining brush biopsy (a less invasive approach to obtaining diagnostic tissue) with PARPi-FL staining is a feasible approach to identifying tumor cells in a complex tissue sample
 In oral cancer, we developed a staining and imaging method for freshly excised biopsies that allows for the identification of positive margins within minutes while preserving the fresh tissue for other downstream applications
 We then tested the diagnostic accuracy of this detection method in human biopsies and evaluated its translational potential In additional support of the translational potential of PARPi-FL, we show first-in-human in vivo imaging after topical application (NCT)
 Finally, we explore the potential to expand PARPi-FL imaging to in situ surgical guidance applications with a large surgical window after intravenous delivery in a large animal The presented studies are consistent in demonstrating the clinical relevance of PARPi-FL-based optical imaging methods for the early detection and intraoperative delineation of cancers that develop at the epithelial surface

 In all specimens, three regions of interest were analyzed: tumor, normal epithelium, and deep margin (comprising submucosa and muscle tissue)
 We found strongly increased PARP1 expression in tumor compared to deep margin as well as epithelium, which had limited physiological PARP1 expression in its basal layer (Fig

 However, given the limited accessibility of the esophagus, we explored an alternative topical application strategy and measured penetration depth of PARPi-FL in the esophagus of a pig using a balloon applicator with sponge-like Lubrizol stripes (Fig
 2G) soaked with 2 mL of a 1 M PARPi-FL solution
 After insertion into the pigs esophagus in a deflated state, the balloon was inflated to expose the Lubrizol stripes and induce release of PARPi-FL onto the esophagus wall of the anesthetized pig for a duration of 3 min; 10 min after the application, the pig was sacrificed, followed by necropsy and cryopreservation of the esophagus in 10x10 mm tiles
 Cryosections were cut perpendicular to the esophagus surface (Fig

 On fresh slides, without further staining, we detected nuclear PARPi-FL staining in the basal layer of the epithelium (100-200 m depths) and mucus glands in the submucosa, up to 800 m below the tissue surface (Fig

 Deeper-lying mucus glands and submucosal tissue (>1000 m depth) showed very low to non-detectable fluorescence

 All biospecimens contained invasive carcinomas with high levels of PARP1 expression (Fig

 In the normal epithelium, PARP1 expression was found in the basal layer and at very low levels in the deep margin (Fig

 Brush biopsy techniques have been investigated as a less invasive alternative to standard punch and scalpel biopsies
 We conducted a feasibility study to determine if brush biopsies in combination with PARPi-FL staining could enable rapid detection of tumor cells in cell suspensions derived from solid tissues
 In a proof-of-principle approach, we developed an ex vivo staining protocol and flow cytometric analysis of single-cell suspensions derived from pharynx cancer xenografts (FaDu cells) and healthy mouse tongues (Fig

 In addition, we were able to confirm these results in esophageal cancer cells (OE19), which also showed a higher percentage of PARPi-FL-positive cells in tumor compared to tongue tissue and a significant uptake reduction after olaparib blocking (fig

 Thus, this proof-of-principle experiment showed that PARPi-FL staining of a cell suspension derived from a complex tissue can help to distinguish between tumor cell containing and normal samples, encouraging further PARP1 expression during malignant transition and at tumor margins in oral cancer In oral cancer, we confirmed the gradual increase of PARP1 expression during malignant transition
 We further analyzed tumor margins to gain insight into the clinical potential of PARP-In healthy epithelial tissues, physiological PARP1 expression was localized predominantly to the basal layer of the epithelium
 In benign, dysplastic, and malignant biospecimens (n=60), we found an increase in PARP1 expression, particularly for cases with severe dysplasia (=carcinoma in situ) and in invasive tumors (Fig

 This was reflected in the quantification of the PARP1-positive area, which was significantly higher in severe dysplasia and tumors compared to benign cases, mild dysplasia, and moderate dysplasia (p<

 To substantiate these results, we also employed a manual scoring method for PARP1 IHC, based on the percentage of PARP1-positive cells and staining intensity (fig

 The selected fresh tissue staining protocol consisted of 5 min PARPi-FL staining followed by 10 min of washing, and was translated to fresh human biopsy samples

 Endogenous collagen-related autofluorescence, which was observed in the submucosa of the clinical samples, was discriminated from the exogenous PARPi-FL signal by two-channel imaging
 PARPi-FL signals only appeared after 488 nm excitation, while autofluorescence was present after both the 488 nm and 543 nm excitations (fig

  The purpose of the presented dataset was to validate our PARPi-FL staining method and identify if samples containing tumor (in the clinical setting: positive margins) can be reliably distinguished from samples not containing tumor (negative margins)
 Most importantly, considering an intraoperative setting, our data also suggests that focal tumor invasion into a suspected negative margin or a predominantly negative biopsy can be clearly identified and demarcated from The simplicity of the PARPi-FL staining method, paired with its contemporaneous readout, makes for a technology well-suited to clinically relevant settings, including the operating room
 Admittedly, the rate-limiting step of this technology would be image acquisition with a state-of-the-art confocal microscope
 Reasoning that a quicker, more user-friendly readout would be preferable, we tested a confocal scanner, which is designed to rapidly analyze fresh tissue specimens by creating a high-resolution strip-mosaic (Vivascope 2500, Caliber ID, Andover, MA)
 We stained fresh FaDu xenograft tissue with PARPi-FL (0, 100, 250 nM) for 10 min, placed the tissue on the scanner, and scanned the field of view of 15x15 mm in about 150 s
 The high-resolution images allowed for clear identification of PARPi-FL-stained nuclei (fig
 SA)
 This was confirmed using human biospecimens, which were also used for regular confocal microscopy (compare Fig
 B)
 Tumor cell nuclei in the human biospecimen samples were clearly identified based on their strong PARPi-FL staining, which was in alignment with H&E and PARP1 IHC (fig

 Here, we validated an in vivo imaging device, the ViewnVivo (Optiscan, Mulgrave, Australia), a miniaturized handheld confocal endomicroscope with an adjustable focal plane, suitable for in vivo or ex vivo imaging (Fig

 Images of the same human biospecimens as presented in fig
 S13B revealed comparable image quality for tumor detection, including clear delineation of tumor cell nuclei and the PARP1-expressing basal layer in margin tissue (Fig
 B)
 Intuitively, the ViewnVivo has the potential to be used for intraoperative, PARPi-FL-based in vivo imaging without tissue excision
 For this specific application  imaging in the surgical cavity  intravenous instead of topical delivery would be required, since distribution of PARPi-FL in the entire tumor mass would enable surgical guidance across the whole surgical bed
 Key questions in this regard are the necessary injected mass and surgical window for imaging
 Intravenous injection of 
05 mg/kg PARPi-FL in a pig (fig
 S15A) resulted in a blood half-life of 
6  
48 min and simultaneously revealed that it was possible to detect PARPi-FL specifically in PARP1 expressing nuclei in the epithelial basal layer as soon as 5 min post injection and up to 120 min post injection (fig

 In human biospecimens, and across all three investigated cancer types, we confirm that malignant tissues express significantly higher levels of PARP1 than normal epithelium and submucosal tissue, supporting our central hypothesis that PARP1 will yield high-contrast imaging as a diagnostic and resolution imaging has the potential to improve early diagnosis and surgical removal of tumors
 Of particular translational importance, PARPi-FL-based differentiation of tumor and normal tissue in fresh human oral cancer biopsies could be achieved with >95% sensitivity and specificity
 PARPi-FL imaging uses fresh tissue for staining and is non-destructive and contemporaneous (-min staining time), all features that promote effortless clinical integration
 Intuitively, the absence of terminal processing preserves the tissue for further applications following PARPi-FL imaging, We investigated PARP1 expression in esophageal cancer, consisting of adeno- and squamous cell carcinomas (stage T-T)
 We found that all tumors had higher levels of PARP1 expression (
3 to 
6% PARP1-positive area) than normal epithelium and submucosal (deep margin) tissue (
3% to 
0% PARP1-positive area), representing a clear quantitative separation between normal and tumor tissue
 Similarly, we found a range of different PARP1 expression levels in our preclinical models, where increasing PARP1 expression resulted in higher PARPi-FL uptake and tumor-to-esophagus ratios of up to

 In addition to white light endoscopy, current surveillance protocols require invasive four-quadrant biopsies every 2-5 years
 Sampling errors complicate this approach, since progression to cancer usually occurs in only a small fraction of the area presenting Barretts mucosa, while excisional quadrant biopsies cover only about 4% of the area affected by BE ()
 Conceivably, complementing white light endoscopy with PARPi-FL imaging could guide biopsy site selection and enhance non-invasive identification of suspicious areas, including flat, small, Existing diagnostic aids, including acetic acid, methylene blue (29, 30), or Lugols iodine (31) do not provide a biomarker-specific signal As their benefit for biopsy site selection is limited, their clinical adoption rate is low
 Clinical translation and integration of PARPi-FL imaging into regular white light endoscopy workflows can be optimized by using a topical application approach, as has been suggested for oral cancer imaging ()
 To reach the esophagus, we tested an alternative route of administration using a balloon applicator
 Recently, balloon-based devices have been introduced to retrieve cells (32) or DNA (33) from the esophagus in order to detect BE and EAC
 In our case, we deployed a balloon-based applicator with highly absorbent Lubrizol stripes, which are collapsed inside of folds when the balloon is deflated but exposed and pressed onto the esophageal certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 The pig model we used generally resembles the human esophaguss anatomy and size
 However, Yucatan pigs were found to have a considerable number of esophageal mucus glands, which do nevertheless express PARP
 By measuring PARPi-FL uptake in relation to gland depth, we were able to show penetration and specific binding of PARPi-FL up to 800 m into the tissue within 3 min of application
 These results corroborate the small molecules ability to penetrate well beyond the epithelial layers where EAC originates
 Thus, our results indicate that specific, PARPi-FL-based detection of superficially presenting cancerous lesions in the esophagus Novel methods for early detection, surveillance, and surgical guidance are also urgently needed in oral and oropharyngeal cancer
 The incidence of oral and oropharyngeal cancer is increasing, while survival has shown no or only modest improvement over the last three decades ()
 A main contributor to disease-related mortality is tumor stage at the time of diagnosis
 Although the oral cavity is easily accessible for regular inspection, about two-thirds of all patients in the US present with advanced-stage disease, resulting in an overall five-year survival rate of about 50%, as compared to over 80% if diagnosed at an early stage
 Another complicating factor for improving the standard of care is that socioeconomic groups with high oral cancer incidence are also the least likely to have dental or health insurance, further delaying diagnosis of their often asymptomatic disease (35, )
 The global situation is now more dire than ever, with respect to both incidence and number of associated deaths (300,000 and 145,000, respectively ())
 In India, where oral cancer is the third most common malignancy in men, the disease often remains untreated for extended amounts of time
 Here, it is less HPV or smoking/drinking that drives the disease, but rather the consumption of paan/gutka (chewing tobacco), both common mild stimulants that certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Very few patients in India survive if their disease is discovered Currently, no diagnostic adjuncts have shown a proven clinical benefit for detection or surveillance of oral cancer
 However, considering the various emerging optical imaging methods (11), we believe that molecularly specific fluorescence contrast, as provided by PARPi-FL, combined with novel analytical devices and methodologies, has the clear potential to improve delineation and detection of oral and oropharyngeal cancer
 One such novel combination is PARPi-FL brush cytology
 Brush cytology, also known as exfoliative cytology or brush biopsy, is a minimally invasive technique in which cells are collected between the surface and basement membrane of the epithelium, rather than using invasive incisional biopsy, followed by cytopathological evaluation (7, )
 Despite extensive clinical evaluation, adoption into clinical practice is still limited, partially due to the high cost of cytopathology as well as mixed reports about its sensitivity We evaluated whether a combination of brush biopsy and PARPi-FL staining is feasible in oropharyngeal cancer to identify and quantify tumor cells in a tissue sample
 Analysis of PARP1 high PARP1 expressioneven higher than in oral and esophageal cancerwhile normal epithelial expression resembled other physiological backgrounds
 Located behind the oral cavity, oro- and hypopharyngeal cancers are less accessible to visual inspection than other oral cancer types, such as tongue cancer
 Brush cytology, however, could be easily performed in this location
 To establish a PARPi-FL staining method for brush cytology-like samples, we prepared a single-cell solution, certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    as it would be derived during the brush cytology process, from solid xenograft tumor samples with known high PARP1 expression (FaDu (26); OE19, Fig
 )
 Instead of cytopathological evaluation, we then stained this complex tissue sample with PARPi-FL and analyzed the percentage of PARPi-FL-positive cells using flow cytometry
 We found a significantly higher number of PARPi-FL-stained cells in both xenograft models than in non-neoplastic tongue tissue samples
 Importantly, due to the homology of human and murine PARP1, PARPi-FL targets both human and murine tissues
 Considering PARP1 IHC results, a baseline level of PARPi-FL-positive cells in normal tongue samples was not surprising, since PARP1 expression in the epitheliums basal layer is well-These proof-of-principle results warrant further studies on combining PARPi-FL with brush cytology to establish baselines for PARPi-FL-positive cells in preclinical and human samples
 staining intensity, and cell size and granularity (forward and side scatter) could further increase the accuracy of this approach
 A flow-based technology has the advantage of investigating suspicious lesions in a minimally invasive, quantitative, and automatable approach
 In addition to pharyngeal cancer, application of PARPi-FL brush cytology is promising in all locations where brush cytology is currently explored, including other sites inside the oral cavity (40) and esophagus While PARPi-FL brush cytology is a technology tailored for the screening and surveillance setting, PARPi-FL tissue staining is a promising approach for both pre- and intraoperative diagnostics

 Considering the potential clinical impact, our most essential finding was that in severe increased when compared to all other degrees of dysplasia and normal epithelium
 Our results indicate that PARP1-based diagnosis could differentiate benign and potentially malignant lesions from normal epithelium and cancerous lesions that require surgical treatment, allowing for surveillance and chemoprevention to reduce the risk of cancer development ()
  Such results suggest measurement of PARP1 expression via PARPi-FL has the potential to identify different disease stages, including early stages
 Despite a strong statistical separation of advanced disease from normal tissue, a certain overlap can be observed between groups, which we attribute to i) inter-patient heterogeneity of PARP1 expression and ii) imperfect histopathologic diagnostic separation of different stages of dysplasia
 This is supported by our data where only paired data on PARP1 expression are analyzed  here, no intra-patient overlap between tumor and normal epithelium was observed
 PARP1 IHC quantification also showed that surgical tumor margins were clearly delineated by PARP1 expression
 This is significant, since almost all oral cancers are surgically treated
 Complete removal, defined by clear margins, is a major determining factor for local recurrence (3, 44, )
 The current gold standard for negative tumor margins is clearance greater than 5 mm on permanent histopathology (46), which is not available until days after surgery
 The only method currently available to surgeons for intraoperative feedback before surgical closure and reconstruction is frozen section analysis of surgical margins, which are sampled during surgery and sent to a pathologist

 Moreover, many view frozen sections critically, since accuracy is reduced as compared to paraffin sections, positive effects on outcome have not been reported, and the cost:benefit ratio is 20:1 ()
 The PARPi-FL fresh tissue staining method reported here offers a promising alternative or addition to frozen section analysis
 We have shown that PARPi-FL staining patterns of tumor biopsies and normal epithelium are distinct
 We also identified several cases of focal invasion of tumor cells into an otherwise normal area based on the PARPi-FL signal PARPi-FL staining patterns strongly represent PARP1 staining on IHC but were achieved within minutes of biopsy (as quickly as one minute)
 The rapid nature of the staining, in combination with back-table imaging, could provide feedback much faster than with frozen sections
 If positive margins are found, the surgeon could perform re-excision and margin evaluation without delay
 The vicinity to the surgery would also improve accuracy in anatomic sample orientation, a frequent source of error in frozen sections
 We determined an excellent sensitivity and specificity of >95% for the identification of tumor and margin samples in fresh human biospecimens using blinded readers who received minimal training (10 min), supporting our claim that this method could be implemented in the clinic without the need for highly specialized personnel
 A unique feature of our PARPi-FL staining method is the tissue-preserving nature of the staining, which would allow for integration into existing workflows, since PARPi-FL stained tissue would remain available for either frozen or permanent pathology or other In addition to ex vivo imaging and microscopic evaluation, PARPi-FL holds promise for an array of further applications

 In a clinical scenario, this could enable a targeted search for a positive margin within the tumor bed
 Currently, correlating the exact location of a positive margin, identified histologically ex vivo, to its counterpart in the surgical cavity is challenging due to significant shrinking and distortion that the tissue undergoes upon resection
 In addition, we show feasibility of macroscopic first-in-human PARPi-FL staining and imaging with a topically applied PARPi-FL solution, which is currently under clinical It is frequently suggested that a near infrared version of PARPi-FL would be advantageous over the green fluorescent variant
 However, the fact that PARP1 is an intranuclear target puts several design constraints on a functional PARP1 imaging agent, which have been discussed previously ()
 Longer wavelength PARP imaging agents were introduced in vitro, but the available data suggests pronounced effects on nuclear penetration and clearance affecting their in vivo performance (50, )
 In our opinion, overall pharmacokinetics of PARPi-FL and its ability to serve as a sensor for PARP1 outweighs the wavelength trade-offs
 This is supported by numerous clinical studies involving green fluorescent dyes for surgical guidance, including the first first-in-Together, the versatility of PARPi-FL with respect to application, imaging settings, platforms, and technologies enables a combination of micro- and macroscopic evaluation techniques and thus a large range of applications, including screening, surveillance, biopsy guidance, fresh biopsy staining, in vivo diagnostic capability, and intraoperative margin delineation
 Thus, PARPi-FL offers a whole host of diagnostic and intraoperative applications that can also be combined with each other, which could not be achieved with previously introduced contrast agents or label free certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Our next logical step toward standard of care clinical use of PARPi-FL will be blinded sampling of fresh tissue specimens at multiple clinical sites, with a focus on recruiting patients from different backgrounds and of varying disease stages
 We do know that PARPi-FL staining is a highly sensitive and specific marker for discriminating tumor from non-tumor margins in cases with pathologically confirmed malignancy
 While PARPi-FL could therefore conceivably be used in a surgical setting, its ultimate clinical value as a field diagnostic cannot be confirmed until a larger multi-national, multi-institutional study has been completed

 Pig experiments were carried out at CBSet, Inc
 (Lexington, MA) and were approved by their IACUC
 Topical application was realized using a balloon applicator (developed by Aero-Di-Namics, New York, NY; produced by Medical Murray, North Barrington, IL)
 The balloons are made of silicone with 12 Lubrizol stripes (electrospun Lubrizol tecophilic TN TG 500) and have a nominal diameter of 7 mm, which extends to 20-25 mm upon inflation (Fig
 G)
 The Lubrizol strips are protected inside of pleats during device delivery and removal and are only exposed when inflated
 The Lubrizol stripes were loaded with 2 mL of a 1 M PARPi-FL solution
 The balloon was inserted into the anesthetized pigs esophagus in a deflated state under white light endoscopic guidance
 Inflation led to exposure of the Lubrizol stripes and a pressure induced release of PARPi-FL onto the esophagus wall of the anesthetized pig for a duration of 3 min
 10 min after the application, the pig was sacrificed followed by necropsy and cryopreservation of the esophagus in 10x10 mm tiles
 Cryosections were cut perpendicular to the esophagus surface and imaged using a confocal microscope to detect penetration depths and binding of PARPi-FL from the topical application
