 ;    Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which is thought to have the potential to 47 correct dysbiosis of gut microbiota, has recently been used to treat inflammatory bowel 48 disease (IBD)
 To elucidate the extent and principles of microbiota engraftment in IBD 49 patients after FMT treatment, we conducted an interventional prospective cohort study
 50 The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe 51 Crohns disease (CD)Harvey-Bradshaw Index  7, n = 11, and (2) patients with 52 ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification, S2 and S3, n = )
 All patients were 53 treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were 54 performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time 55 points included)
 At each follow-up time point, fecal samples of the participants were 56 collected along with their clinical metadata
 For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples 57 from 10 healthy people were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut 58 microbiota
 Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals 59 with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded 60 from a previous published paper to represent natural microbiota shifts during FMT
 All 61 We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 63 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients)
 Generally, bacterial colonization was 64 observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain 65 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by 92 disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
 The etiology of IBD has been proposed to be 94 multifactorial, involving a dysregulated immune response to environmental factors in a 95 genetically susceptible individual ()
 Interestingly, given the evidence accumulated in 96 recent years, the gut microbiota is now recognized for playing an important role in IBD
 97 Dysbiosis is a decrease in gut microbial diversity owing to a shift in the balance 98 between commensal and potentially pathogenic microorganisms of the gut microbial 99 ecosystem, and has long been characterized as a trait of IBD patients (,)
  100 Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) aims to modify the intestinal microbiota 101 composition and function of the recipients by transferring donor fecal suspension into 102 the gastrointestinal tract of a recipient, and has become a promising method for 103 manipulating the gut microbiota
 Its successful application for the treatment of 104 Clostridium difficile infection has inspired people to apply it to inflammatory bowel 105 disease patients (,,,,,)
 However, this application is still in its early stages
 106 According to a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, after minimizing 107 publication bias, IBD patients who received FMT had a remission rate of only 
2%: 108 22% for UC and 
5% for CD ()

 ;    Clinical research to date has focused more on UC (7,8,9), and there has been 111 insufficient research on the effects of FMT on CD patients, with only a few case 112 reports and small-scale case series reported (,,,)
 In addition, the majority of 113 studies conducted so far to investigate the role FMT plays in treating IBD have used 114 16S rRNA sequencing, which has limited resolution on taxonomic and functional 115 classification of sequences
 Contradictory results were often observed at species-level 116 resolution, making it hard to determine the exact role of different bacterial agents
 For 117 instance, the abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was found to decrease in one 118 study and to increase in another (,)
 Thus, it is necessary to be able to appreciate 119 the whole composition of gut microbiota at a strain level
 Strain level variants within 120 microbial species are crucial in determining their functional capacities within the 121 human microbiome, such as interaction with host tissues (17), modulation of immune 122 with the ability to target all DNA material in a sample can give a base pair level 124 resolution of the genome that makes single nucleotide analysis possible
 Additionally, 125 promising machine learning methods could enable the establishment of predictive 126 models to predict the microbiota composition of post-FMT recipients
 Recently, S
 127 Smillie et al constructed a machine learning model to predict the species profile of 128 post-FMT recipients for 18 C
 difficile patients and found that bacterial abundance and 129 phylogeny were the strongest determinants of engraftment ()
 In our study, we utilize 130 a random forest model to predict the mOTUs profile of IBD recipient 3 days after FMT 131 and identified the variables that contribute most to model prediction accuracy

 Similar to the process of determining species retention 222 and transplantation, the gut microbiota composition of post-FMT recipients was 223 common strains (shared by donor and recipient)

 Quantification of the three groups was 226 Species engraftment model
 We sought to investigate whether the microbiota 228 composition of post-FMT recipients could be predicted using advanced machine 229 learning models
 We therefore applied the Random Forest algorithm in R to predict the 230 presence (random forest classification model) and abundance (random forest regression 231 model) of each mOTU in every post-FMT recipient sample
 For a dataset comprised of 232 15 samples and 123 filtered mOTUs, these models are trained on 15 x 127 total 233 instances

 Third, we applied the randomForest function to perform 244 classification of post-FMT recipients across all mOTUs

 Finally, we chose important features from those models that had good 247 For the regression model, we also accounted for class balance and then used the rfcv 249 function with the same predictors that we used in the classification model to perform 250 Feature Importance
 Random Forest calculates feature importance by removing each 252 feature from the model and measuring the decrease in accuracy (for presence) or the 253 increase in the mean-square error (for abundance)
 According to these importance 254 scores, we ranked features in decreasing order across models and picked 40 with the 255 Correlations between change in mOTUs as well as in clinical parameters
 Clinical 257 metadata of patients was collected at baseline and follow-up visits, including physical 258 immunoglobulin
 We used the rcorr function in the Hmisc package to compute the 260 spearman correlation iterating from each mOTU-clinical index pair
 The change in 261 each mOTU was defined as the increase or decrease in its relative abundance 3 days 262 after FMT treatment compared to baseline
 Changes in clinical index were computed 263 based on the absolute score recipients got at baseline and 3 days after FMT treatment

 For example, 3 days 289 after FMT treatment, there was a universal increase in Bacteroides that have been 290 shown to exist at lower levels in IBD patients than in healthy people ()
 Some highly 291 individualistic performances were also observed: CD-9 gained an abundant amount of 292 Lactobacillus, which was considered to be probiotics, and CD-1 had a great decrease in 293 Citrobacter, which was recognized to be pathogenic bacteria (Figure B)
 The amounts 294 of species each recipient gained from their donor after FMT are shown in Figure S
  295 To investigate the extent to which the gut microbiota of recipients could be altered by 297 FMT treatment, we evaluated both the degree and direction of change
 Results showed 298 that microbial communities underwent large compositional changes after FMT, and 299 On average, post-FMT CD recipients gained

 CD-2 showed a slightly tendency to return to their initial status, but the 309 disturbance was small enough to be ignored (a shift from 
628 to 
 )
 310 Surprisingly, CD-1 showed an increased distance from both their donor and their 311 pre-FMT status, which could be attributed to environmental factors
 Though CD-1, 312 CD-2, and UC-2 all shared the same donor, the direction of their gut flora shift after the 313 treatment varied (Figure A)
 In addition, we explored the abundance consistency of 314 mOTUs of recipients before and after FMT
 mOTUs of the recipient post-FMT were 315 highly correlated with mOTUs of the recipient pre-FMT (median cosine similarity of 316 UC patient mOTUs =

 More importantly, the results showed 317 that mOTUs of post-FMT recipients had high similarity to mOTUs of their donors 318 (median cosine similarity of UC patient mOTUs =

 Donor-specific SNVs were 333 most highly retained 3 days after FMT (UC:

 This was in contrast with the much lower rates of variation 336 observed at equivalent time points in autologous FMT recipients (
5  
8%) (Figure 337 S1), showing that the increased variations of gut microbiota in post-FMT patients 338 could be attributed to donor strain transfer instead of temporal variability
  339 Furthermore, marked differences in colonization success were observed between UC 340 and CD recipients who shared a donor (subjects CD-1,2,3,8, and UC-,)

 345 This suggests that novel strains can colonize the gut without replacing the indigenous 346 strain population of the recipient
 It appeared that introduced strains were more likely 347 to be established in a new environment if the species was already present, and a pattern 348 of donor strains establishing alongside indigenous strains of the recipient was observed
 349 While the phenomenon of donor strain establishment occurred in both CD and UC 350 recipients, UC patients were more susceptible to external sources of microbiota (Figure 351 certified by peer review) is the author/funder
