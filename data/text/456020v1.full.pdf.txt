 ;    The role of lymphoid tissue as a potential source of HIV-1 rebound following interruption of antiretroviral therapy is uncertain
 To address this issue, we compared the latent viruses obtained from CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood and lymph nodes to viruses emerging during treatment interruption
 Latent viruses were characterized by sequencing near full-length (NFL) proviral DNA, and env from viral outgrowth cultures (VOAs)
 5 HIV-1 infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) were studied, 4 of whom participated in a clinical trial that included an analytical treatment interruption
 Intact or replication competent clonal sequences from blood and lymph node overlapped
 In contrast, there was no overlap between 205 latent reservoir and 125 rebound sequences in the 4 individuals who underwent treatment interruption
 However, rebound viruses could be accounted for by recombination
 The data suggests that CD4+ T cells carrying latent viruses circulate between blood and lymphoid tissues in individuals on ART and support the idea that recombination may play a role in the emergence of rebound viremia

 ;    ART is an effective treatment for HIV-1 infection
 However, HIV-1 persists as proviral DNA in CD4+ T cells and produces a latent reservoir that demonstrates remarkable stability ()
 Upon ART interruption, nearly all individuals experience viral rebound within 1-6 weeks ()
 However, most integrated proviruses are defective (7, 8), and only a small percentage can replicate and produce the infectious virions that mediate rebound viremia when ART is interrupted
 Latent viruses can be recovered from the reservoir by viral outgrowth assays (VOA) and by polymerase chain reaction amplification of integrated proviruses (9, )
 Using these methods latent viruses have been recovered from lymph nodes, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), spleen, CNS, In 4 recent studies, comparison of circulating latent viruses and rebound viruses showed a very limited number of overlapping sequences (10, )
 One potential explanation for this observation is that latent viruses found in CD4+ T cells in lymphoid and other tissues differ from those in circulation, and that these sequestered cells are responsible for the rebound viremia
 To examine the relationship between latent viruses in circulation and in lymph node, we studied 5 individuals who had concurrent blood draws and lymph node biopsies
 Rebound plasma was available for 4 of these individuals who were enrolled in a clinical trial that included an analytical treatment interruption after 24 weeks of therapy with a TLR9 agonist
  To investigate the intact proviral reservoir, we obtained mononuclear cells from lymph nodes (LNMC) and peripheral blood (PBMC) from 4 ART treated HIV-1 infected individuals (extended not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

3 years (range 
 
 )
 All 4 participated in an interventional trial in which a TLR9 agonist was co-administered with ART for 24 weeks (figure 1a) ()
 PBMCs and LNMCs were collected in the last 2 weeks of the 24 week period
 Subsequently ART was interrupted until viral rebound
 Plasma was collected before ART re-initiation
 Time from ART withdrawal to viral rebound was between 915 days (figure 2a) which is not significantly different from a non-interventional ATI control cohort of 52 participants (ACTG cohort) (2224) (figure 2b, P = 
5, Log-rank test)
 In addition, we obtained PBMCs and LNMC from an HIV-1 infected individual (ID LFSO), who had been on ART for 
3 years without additional interventions or treatment interruption (extended data table b)
 To obtain full-length env sequences from viruses that were replication competent and/or genetically intact, CD4+ T cells from blood and lymph node were assayed by VOA, and near full-length (NFL) PCR (10) (extended data Intact and defective latent viruses from blood and lymph node CD4+ T cells overlap  We obtained 205 latent virus sequences: 93 and 79 intact NFL sequences from blood and lymph node, respectively, and 33 from VOA from blood (extended data table )
 44% of all sequences belonged to expanded clones, 98% of which overlapped between blood and lymph node (i

 identical sequences)
 There were no statistical differences between the frequency of clonal sequences in blood compared to lymph node (two sided Fishers exact test, p-values in extended data table a)

 Overall 43% of all env sequences belonged to expanded clones (143 sequences), and 89% of the clones overlapped between blood and lymph node (two sided Fishers exact test, p-values in extended data table b)
 We conclude that CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood and lymph To further examine the relative proviral nucleic acid content in peripheral blood and lymph node, we compared the frequency of: 1) GAG+ cells; 2) full-length genomes; and 3) intact NFL proviruses (figure c)
 The frequency of GAG+, full-length genomes and intact NFL per 106 CD4+ T cells was not statistically different between peripheral blood and lymph node (figure c)
 Thus, in our cohort the frequency of intact and defective HIV-1 proviruses in CD4+ T cells is similar in 125 full-length env sequences were obtained by SGA from rebound plasma, none of which overlapped with any of the latent reservoir sequences (figure )
 Nevertheless, phylogenetic analysis revealed that plasma rebound viruses were related to latent viruses in peripheral blood and lymph node from the same individual (figure 4a and b)
 Thus, the latent viruses obtained from peripheral blood and lymph node are related to, but do not appear to be the direct origin of rebound To determine whether mutations accumulating during rebound can account for the divergence between the latent reservoir and rebound viruses we used a stochastic mutation simulation model (20, 25, 26) (extended data figure )

 By including the possibility of mutation and recombination, we were able to account for 53% of the rebound sequences
  HIV-1 proviruses are present in lymphoid cells in all tissues analyzed to date ()
 However, the relationship between viruses found in different sites and their contribution to persistence is not well defined
 Our data suggest that the latent viruses found in circulation overlap with those found in lymph nodes and that the most prevalent viruses in these compartments are not typically found It has been suggested that lymph nodes serve as a sanctuary site for latent HIV-1 (27, )
 However, we found the same overall frequency of HIV-1 proviruses in blood and lymph node CD4+ T cells
 Moreover, the two compartments contained similar numbers of replication competent viruses, and shared clones of latent viruses
 Thus, expanded CD4+ T cell clones bearing latent viruses circulate between these two compartments
 Finally, rebound viruses did not overlap with either blood or Our findings are consistent with a number of previous observations indicating that there are similar amounts of HIV-1 DNA in CD4+ T cells in blood and in tissues (29, )
 However, our work is limited by the numbers of individuals and CD4+ T cells analyzed and therefore we cannot rule out the possibility that a subset of lymph node cells, such as CD4+ TFH cells, are enriched in or harbor a not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Three other studies have also shown little or no overlap between circulating latent viruses and rebound viruses (10, 19, )
 Including the data reported here, there are only 3 overlapping sequences among 1816 independently derived latent reservoir viruses and 642 rebound viruses
 Instead, the latent and rebound compartments appear to be related by recombination
 There are a number of potential explanations for the lack of concordance between latent and rebound viruses
 One possibility is that latent reservoir sampling has been inadequate
 For example, the active reservoir responsible for rebound might be found primarily in a tissue that has not been assayed, such as the gut
 A second non-exclusive possibility is that the majority of the latent viruses in blood and lymph node fail to emerge in vivo because they are in some way unfit to do so
 For example, the majority of latent viruses assayed could be susceptible to immune pressure resulting in selection of a subset of rebound viruses which can escape anti-viral immunity in vivo possibly by In conclusion, the data reported indicated that the majority the latent clonal viruses found in blood are also found in the lymph nodes and add to the growing body of literature suggesting that rebound viruses are either not present in or are rare components of the latent reservoir found in circulation

 For genomic DNA extraction, we used Gentra Puregene Cell Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturers instructions
 Near full-length sequencing (NFL) was done by an initial limiting-dilution semi-nested PCR amplifying the gag gene using the primers 3GagIN, 5GAGIN, GAGININ
 If these primers failed, we used the primers GAGB5out, GAGB3out, GAGB5in, GAGB3in as previously described (8, 9) (extended data table )
 Gag PCR products were visualized using 1% 96-well E-Gels (Invitrogen)
 Dilutions with < 30% positive of the PCR wells were selected for further analysis
 According to Poisson statistics, this dilution has over 90% probability of containing one HIV-1 DNA molecule in each PCR reaction
 The NFL HIV-1 genome was amplified as a nested PCR with primers and cycling conditions as previously described (8, 9, )
 Briefly, the outer 9,064 bp PCR was performed using the primers BLOuterF and BLOuterR (extended data table 6) and High Fidelity Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen)
 For the nested PCR, 
75 l was transferred and the env gene amplified using the primers envB5out and envBout
 Wells containing an intact env gene were selected using 1% 96-well E-Gels (Invitrogen) and the corresponding outer PCR products were collected for further analyzes
 NFL outer PCR products were subjected to a nested PCR to generate four segments A, B, C, D comprising overlapping parts of the genome
 The PCR products were visualized on a 
8% agarose gel to determine amplicon size
 PCR products with the accepted size (A: 4,449 bp; B: 5,793 bp; C: 6,385 bp; D: 4,778 bp) were combined as either A+C, A+D, B+C or B+D and subsequently subjected to library preparation and sequencing using Illumina MiSeq Nano 300 (Illumina) cycle kits at a final concentration of 12 pM, as described above

 TLR9 agonist study design and clonal distribution of the latent HIV-1 in peripheral blood and lymph nodes
 a, Study design
 Green area represents time on ART before enrollment and during the 24 weeks of TLR9 agonist treatment
 Blue area represents time off ART
 W and numbers and represents weeks elapsed
 Lymph node (LN) and peripheral blood (PB) were collected 1-2 weeks before initiation of the analytical treatment interruption (ATI)
 SGA depicts the time point where plasma was collected and ART subsequently reinitiated
 b, Pie charts showing the distribution of intact near full-length (NFL) and VOA-derived env sequences
 Numbers in the center of the circles represents total number of intact/replication competent sequences obtained
 White areas in pie charts are sequences obtained once (singles)
 Colored areas represent sequences obtained more than once (clones)
 Clones, which are found in both PB and LN within an individual, share the same color between the two PB/LN pie charts
 The size of the slices in the pie charts is proportional to the relative size of the clone
 For ID 101, 116 and LFSA, there is no significant difference between the frequency of clones in PB and LN (two-sided Fishers exact test)
 c, Frequency of GAG+ cells per 106 CD4+ T cells in LN and PB
 Frequency of full length viruses (amplicon size determined using 
8% agarose gel: i
 e
 at least one combination of either A+C, A+D, B+C or B+D possible (Ho et al, 2013)) per 106 CD4+ T cells in LN and PB
 Frequency of intact near full-length (NFL) sequences per 106 CD4+ T cells in LN and PB
 There was no statistical difference between the frequencies of GAG+, (p-value=
31) full-length viruses (p-value=
63) and intact NFL (p-value=
81) per 106 CD4+ T cells (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test)

 Time to viral rebound during ATI
 a, Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (left y-axis) and days elapsed (x-axis) for the 4 participants receiving the TLR9 agonist
 Black lines on the x-axis connect dots that denote HIV-1 RNA levels at the indicated number of days after ATI
 Lower limit of HIV-1 RNA detection was 20 copies/mL
 Gray shaded areas depict time on ART
 b, Kaplan-Meier plot summarizing time to rebound for the 4 TLR9 agonist trial participants (red line) compared to a cohort of 52 ACTG trial participants (black line) who underwent ATI without intervention
 Log-rank test P value shows the comparison of time to rebound for the TLR9 agonist treated and the Figure
