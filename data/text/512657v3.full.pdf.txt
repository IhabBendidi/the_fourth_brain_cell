 Previously, animal models demonstrated that stimulation of vmPFC inputs to the amygdala promotes the formation of extinction memories []
 We suggest the notion that enhanced transmission in this pathway may possibly reflect a core mechanism densely expressed in limbic and prefrontal regions critically engaged in extinction [16-18] and are considered to modulate learning-related neuroplasticity
 LT is a selective competitive antagonist of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor but also increases availability of angiotensin II-converted angiotensin IV-an agonist at the AT4 receptor subtype
 The AT4 system is thought to play a role in neuroplasticity and learning and memory [16, 17, 28, 51], a mechanism that is suggested to likely contribute to Consistent with previous animal models demonstrating the potential of LT to enhance extinction in rodents [19, 20], the present study successfully demonstrated the potential of a single, low-dose administration of LT to facilitate extinction learning in humans
 In the context of recent findings suggesting a direct association current results indicate that LT represents a highly promising candidate to augment the efficacy of exposure-based interventions in therapeutic settings

 Immediately before the start of the experiment, shock intensity levels were adjusted on an individual level by delivering gradually increasing shocks until the shock reached the level that participants reported as highly uncomfortable, but not painful
 SCRs were assessed at a sampling rate of 1kHz from attached to the first and second fingers of the left hand between the first and second phalanges via Biopac Module EDA100C-MRI module attached to a MP150 (Biopac The level of a skin conductance response per se was defined as the maximum of the low-pass filtered (

 Responses below

 To account for individual variability, the raw SCR scores were square root transformed and range corrected by dividing each response by the mean square root transformed US response during initial acquisition[15, ]

 In line with a previous study [24] the pattern expression was variable (X) and a dependent variable (Y) could be explained by a third variable (M)
 Significant mediation is obtained when inclusion of M in a path model of the effect of X on Y significantly alters the slope of the XY relationship
 That is, the difference between total (path c) and direct (non-mediated, path c) effects of X on Y (i

 We performed voxel-wise treatment effects on fMRI activation (path a) and fMRI correlates of psychophysiological threat responses controlled for treatment effect (path b), and the a  b mediation effect were explored on the voxel-level
 Significance estimates were calculated at each voxel for each path as well as mediation effect through bootstrapping (10,000 replacements)
