 42 Identifying new agents with the sensitivity and selectivity toward leukemic cells with less 43 systemic toxicity is a warrant
 Peptide-based therapeutics is gaining attention during the last 44 few years
 Here, we used an integrative workflow combining mass spectrometric peptide 45 library construction, in silico anticancer peptide screening, and in vitro leukemic cell studies 46 to discover a novel anti-leukemic peptide owning 3+charges and alpha-helical structure, 47 namely HMP-S7, from human breast milk
 HMP-S7 showed cytotoxic activity against four 48 distinct leukemic cell lines in a dose-dependent manner but had no affected on solid 49 malignancies or representative normal cells

 In conclusion, HMP-S7 is the selective 52 anti-leukemic peptide promising for further validation in preclinical and clinical studies

 62 predominant, accounting for 30% of childhood cancer ()
 Optimization of 64 chemotherapeutic regimens during the past decades has resulted in more than 90% 65 remission rate in childhood ALL ()
 However, the burden of late morbidity due to 66 chemotherapeutic treatments, which occur in two-thirds of pediatric cases (4), has become 67 important considerations as the number of long-term leukemic survivors increases ()
 68 Moreover, specific subsets of pediatric ALL are relatively resistant to standard 69 chemotherapy and have a high risk of relapse ()
 These challenges pose the need to further 70 improve current treatment while identifying new agents should also be concerned with the 71 sensitivity and selectivity toward leukemic cells with less-to-no toxicity to normal cells
 72 Peptide-based drugs, or anticancer peptides, can be a new strategy for cancer 73 treatment
 Although the exact mechanism and selectivity criteria have yet to be elucidated, 74 anticancer peptides may have oncolytic effects depending on peptide characteristics and 75 target membrane features in selectivity and toxicity ()
 Cancer cells have high negative 76 outer surface area), the net negative charge from anionic molecules on the surface
 In 78 contrast, normal cells are electrically neutral (-)
 These negative charges on the cancer 79 cell membrane are attractive to the positive charge peptides to disturb membrane stability, 80 causing the loss of electrolyte and cell death (8), while high cholesterol contents of the 81 normal cell membrane can protect cell fluidity and block cationic peptide entry ()
 82 Common strategies for anticancer peptide discovery are; i) activity-guided purification from 83 biological/natural products (13); ii) examination of antimicrobial peptides for cancer 84 sensitivities (14, )
 The former approach tends to deliver positive results, but it is 85 associated with labor-intensive and time-consuming processes
 The latter strategy is 86 relatively cost- and time-effective but still limited to antimicrobial peptides known a priori
 87 Investigation of anticancer peptides has progressed slowly in the past decades, indicating 88 gaps for improvement, particularly on the selection of peptide sources, screening methods, 89 Human milk is a promising source of therapeutic peptides
 Bioactive milk peptides 91 are released from sourced proteins by enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation with a proteolytic 92 starter culture, and proteolysis with proteolytic microorganisms (16, )
 Although human 93 milk has rarely been investigated for anticancer activities, studies have showed human milk-94 derived peptides could exhibit various biological effects such as antimicrobial (18, 19) and 95 activities, and cell proliferation of human preadipocytes ()
 These bioactive peptides have 98 differed in amino acid compositions and sequences, and the peptide length can vary from 99 two to twenty amino acid residues ()

 Interestingly, breastfeeding for six 104 months or longer was associated with a 19% lower risk of all childhood leukemia than 105 shorter breastfeeding or none (25, )
 Identifying novel anti-leukemic peptides from human 106 milk is a warrant for the future development of non-allergic and non-toxic peptide-based 107  This study aimed to discover a novel anti-leukemic peptide with less cytotoxicity 109 toward normal cells from human milk
 We applied a robust workflow integrating the 110 occurring human milk peptide library in silico screening based on physicochemical, 112 structural, and predictive anticancer properties by machine learning algorithms to prioritize 113 candidates for functional studies of synthetic peptides to determine anti-leukemic activity 114 and the mode of action
 By this strategy, a novel anti-leukemic peptide was identified from 115  To separate human milk peptides and test their cytotoxicity to leukemic cells, ten 119 healthy mothers aged between 25 and 36 years old (
 
27 years old) donated breast milk 120 at once during 6-129 days (
 
97 days) after delivery (details in Table S)
 After 121 multiple steps of centrifugation to remove cells, lipids, and extracellular vesicles, and then 122 ultrafiltration (3-kDa cutoff) to remove proteins, the small molecules (<3-kDa), except the 123 peptides, passed through the C18 SPE
 Moreover, the C18 bound peptides were eluted by 124 various acetonitrile concentrations and then performed their cytotoxicity

 ;    Most human milk peptide fractions had cytotoxic effects on leukemic and normal cell lines 137  After C18 bound peptide elution, the crude milk peptide fraction was tested to 138 observe cytotoxic effects against Jurkat (T lymphoblastic leukemia) and FHs74Int cells (the 139 representative normal intestinal epithelium), respectively (Figure A)
 The crude milk 140 peptides showed a potent cytotoxic effect on Jurkat but had less impact on FHs74Int cells
 141 The coarse milk peptide fraction was then fractionated by C18 SPE with the step-wise ACN 142 elution, in which the chromatogram was demonstrated by the peptide amounts (Figure B)
 143 These eluted peptides by 15%-80% ACN were treated to Jurkat leukemic cells and FHs74Int 144 normal cells to observe cell survival as shown in Figure C
   The low peptide amount in 145 15%-30% ACN eluted peptide fractions could decrease Jurkat cell survival more than the 146 highest peptide amount (45% ACN eluted peptide fraction)
 This indicated that the 147 elimination of Jurkat leukemic cells depended on the specific peptide sequence with 148 Figure

 The milk peptides were bound 154 to the C18 SPE column, eluted with 80% ACN (1 mL), and dried using a SpeedVac 155 concentrator
 The crude milk peptides were resuspended in the culture medium and then 156 treated to Jurkat and FHs74Int cells for 1-3 days (n=3 biological replication)

 Peptides were then fractionated into 10 fractions by 158 C18 SPE column with the step-wise acetonitrile elution
 An equal volume (20 ml) of the 159 individual human milk supernatant (<3 kDa) was flown through the C18 SPE column
 The 160 human milk peptides in the supernatant were bound to the column and eluted by equal 161 volume (1 mL) of 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, and 80% ACN in 162 subsequently

 A total of 142 naturally occurring human milk 176 peptides with unique sequences were collected into the peptide library, ready for further 177 analyses (Table S)
 The distribution of all identified peptides by fractions, peptide length, 178 pI, and the net charge was shown in Figure 3A (upper panel)
 Overall, most identified natural 179 occurring-milk peptides had less than 20 amino acids in length, contained zero and anionic 180 net charge with inclining acid property
 The most frequently detected pattern was the natural 181 peptides with proline-rich sequence (Figure S)
 This proline-rich peptide is probably crucial 182 to some biological effects of human milk
 For example, a ligand containing a proline-rich 183 sequence or a single proline residue is involved in protein-protein interaction ()
 Proline-184 rich sequence-contained antimicrobial peptides can kill microorganisms by interacting with 185 In silico screening of the natural-occurring human milk peptide library was performed 187 by a robust workflow
 Firstly, we screened the library by physicochemical properties, i
 e
, 188 length, pI, and net charge (as shown in Figure 3A) since most of the known anticancer 189 peptides are small cationic peptides (commonly 5-30 amino acid length with net charge +2 to 190 +9) that bind to the negative charge of phosphatidylserine and sialic acid on the cancer cell 191 membrane (12, 29, )
 Secondly, the secondary structure of the peptides were predicted by 192 the PEP-FOLD3 webserver (Figure B)
 Peptides can form alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and 193 random coils ()
 However, most of the known anticancer peptides shared the alpha-helix 194 structure ()
 Thirdly, the identified peptides were predicted for anticancer properties using 195 machine learning prediction software
 Since ACP prediction software could provide different 196 results depending on the algorithms and training datasets, four online-accessible software 197 were then applied in this study, including ACPpred-FL (33), antiCP 
0 (34), MLACP (35), 198 and mACPpred (36) (Figure C)
 As a result, eight human milk peptides and one bovine milk 199 peptide (as a positive ACP control) from various prioritization based on net charges, 200 secondary structures, and the predicted anticancer properties were selected for further 201 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    HMP-S7 killed leukemic cells but not normal cells or solid tumor cell lines 218 Figure 4A illustrated eight selected human milk-derived peptides and a known bovine 219 milk-derived anticancer peptide synthesized for cancer cytotoxicity screening using trypan 220 blue staining
 These results showed that HMP-S7, the highest cationic charged peptide (+3 221 net charge) with -helical structure, had higher inhibitory activity than the other human milk-222 derived peptides against four leukemic cell lines, including Jurkat, Raji, RS4;11, and Sup-223 B15 cells (Figure B)
 To elucidate the selectivity of HMP-S7, the effect of HMP-S7 was 224 further observed on normal cells, i

 Compared to BMP-S6, the known anti-cancer peptide, 228 HMP-S7 had less cytotoxicity toward the normal cells and most cancer cells
 This result 229 suggested that HMP-S7 was more selective to leukemic cells than the BMP-S
 Although 230 HMP-S7 had no cytotoxicity on normal T cells, it showed a mild cytotoxic effect on 231 HEK293T cells
 Based on these activity profiles, HMP-S7 was chosen to further examine the 232 IC50 against four leukemic cell lines (Figure A)
 The results demonstrated anti-leukemic 233 activity of HMP-S7 was dose-dependent, with the IC50 ranged from 
2 to 
3 M 234 depending on leukemic cells to be tested
 Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of the HMP-S7 235 treated Jurkat leukemic cell lines was confirmed by the colony-forming assay using soft agar, 236 as shown in Figure B

 The % cell death was calculated by 248 (number of death cells/total cell number) 
 The percentage of cell death of all 4 249 leukemic cell lines after HMP-S7 treatment can significantly increase

 By confocal microscopy, PI staining of cytoplasmic RNA was observed in the 273 untagged HMP-7 and the positive control Triton X-100 (Figure A)
 The FITC-tagged HMP-274 S7 was located in the cytoplasm as PI stain of cytoplasmic RNA
 Flow cytometry showed 275 that the HMP-S7 could be more cumulative into cytoplasm when increasing the 276 concentrations from IC50 to 2IC50 (Figure 6B and C)

05, 302 This study aimed to explore the novel ACP from naturally occurred-human milk 306 peptides
 Several reasons supported human milk as a good source for this exploration
 First, 307 there is evidence that human breast milk can significantly reduce leukemia in children with 308 more 6-month breastfeeding (25, )
 Second, HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made 309 lethal to tumor cells), a protein-lipid complex that induces apoptosis-like death in tumor cells, 310 was discovered from a human milk protein ()
 Alpha1H (the alpha1 domain of -311 lactalbumin in complex with oleic acid), which was further developed from HAMLET, has 312 entered the First-in-Human trial in patients with bladder cancer (clinicaltrials
gov identifier 313 NCT03560479) ()
 Third, ACP has never been explored from human milk
 Fourth, recent 314 identification from human milk, and in silico ACP prediction algorithms based on the peptide 316 amino acid sequences have been progressed during the last several years
 317 Therefore, this study developed an integrative workflow for ACP discovery by 318 combining the strengths of mass spectrometry, in silico screening, and experimental 319 validation
 This strategy replaces labor-intensive and time-consuming processes of the 320 activity-guided purification by applying mass spectrometric peptide identification of the 321 fractionated human milk samples, and the results were compiled into the peptide library of 322 natural occurring-human milk peptides
 Peptide amino acid sequences were subsequently fed 323 into in silico screening to shorten the time-to-discovery and lessen the cost burden of the 324 large-scale experiment
 Finally, the prioritized peptide candidates could be validated for anti-325 To prioritize the peptides for experimental screening and validation, we hypothesized 327 that the consensus results from the physicochemical property (positive charge), secondary 328 peptide structure (alpha-helix), and ACP predictive results from different machine learning 329 models would provide the best chance of ACP identification from the given peptide library
 330 This hypothesis was grounded on previous evidence that; i) the net positively charged 331 peptides are attractive to the net negatively charged cancer cell membranes (39); ii) most 332 known oncolytic peptides share alpha-helical structure (32); iii) different machine learning 333 models were trained and tested upon various data sets of known ACPs (33-36), thereby these 334 models could have varied predictive performance against the new unknown peptide data set
 335 More votes would provide more confidence in the predictive results
 Since it was unknown 336 at the initial stage of this study if this integrative approach would be successful, we, therefore, 337 explored each of the preferred ACP properties
 For this reason, eight selected peptide 338 candidates were identified and screened for anti-leukemic effect (Figure 3 and Table S)
 339 BMP-S6, the positive control of the experimental validation, has met all three criteria and 340 showed the anti-leukemic effect with a trade-off of more toxicity toward normal cells
 Six 341 out of eight selected peptide candidates were not met all three criteria and showed no activity 342 in vitro
 HMP-S7 and HMP-S8 were the top 2 candidates that met all three criteria of the 343 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    integrative workflow; nonetheless, only HMP-S7 had the cytotoxic effect against leukemic 344 cells
 From this observation, we learned that this integrative approach is more accurate than 345 using a single preferred anticancer property to prioritize peptide candidates
 When one 346 peptide candidate met all three criteria, the difference in one positive charge (and perhaps 347 two votes from machine learning models) did matter for the anti-leukemic prediction (Figure 348 )
 In future studies, this integrative approach of ACP screening can be applied to larger data 349 sets, either the mass spectrometric-based or the in silico generated peptide libraries, to speed 350 Looking forward, HMP-S7 should be further validated in preclinical models
 Further 352 peptide modifications using HMP-S7 as a prototype, for example, amino acid substitution 353 (40), homing motif tagging (41), and PEGylation (42), may improve its anticancer efficacy, 354 tumor targeting, and biocompatibility and stability
 Furthermore, the human milk peptide 355 library can be expanded by further profiling relevant biospecimens or by in silico peptide 356 generation from the proteins of interest
 Aforementioned in vitro study support, machine 357 learning for ACP prediction might be further improved by a combination of ensemble 358 This study had limitations
 It was expected that milk peptides should present a more 360 significant number of unique identities than those identified in this study
 Losing of peptides 361 during mass spectrometric detection because of their neutral net charge may be one reason
 362 Another possibility is that the milk peptides may be degraded during the fractionation 363 process
 These limitations could be overcome by the combined methods using fractionations 364 and high-resolution mass spectrometry detection
 The issues related to the small peptide 365 library because of experimental bottlenecks could be addressed by in silico generated 366 peptide database as aforementioned, given that the custom-made peptides are commercially 367 available and ready for anticancer activity screening
 Lastly, it should be emphasized that 368 ex vivo experiments of HMP-S7 by using the patients derived leukemic cells should be 369 leukemic peptide derived from human breast milk
 This anti-leukemic peptide is a cationic 374 and alpha-helical structure peptide that selectively kills leukemic cells but not normal cells
 375 Future research on peptide modification, together with the efficacy studies in preclinical 376 animal models or patients derived leukemic cells ex vivo, is warranted to develop HMP-S7 377 Human milk collection
 Human milk (60 ml) from 10 healthy volunteer mothers of full-381 term infant, whose blood test has no infection of HIV, Hepatitis B or C viruses, and Syphilis, 382 were collected by a breast pump and stored in a freezer (-20C) as per the regulation of 383 Ramathibodi Human Milk Bank (RHMB) before transferring to the laboratory ()
