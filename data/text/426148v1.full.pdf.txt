 ;    Background: Delirium is an important postoperative complication, yet a simple and effective delirium prediction model remains elusive
 We hypothesized that the combination of the complications (NSQIP-SC) or risk of death (NSQIP-D), and cognitive tests of executive function (Trail Making Test A and B [TMTA, TMTB]), could provide a parsimonious model to predict Methods: Data were collected from 100 adults (>65yo) undergoing major non-cardiac surgery
 In addition to NSQIP-SC, NSQIP-D, TMTA and TMTB, we collected participant age, sex, ASA score, tobacco use, type of surgery, depression, Framingham risk score, and preoperative blood pressure
 Delirium was diagnosed with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), and the Delirium Rating Scale-R-98 (DRS) was used to assess symptom severity
 LASSO and Best Subsets logistic and linear regression were employed in line with TRIPOD guidelines
 Results: Three participants were excluded due to intraoperative deaths (2) and alcohol withdrawal ()
 Ninety-seven participants with a mean age of

 ;    Delirium, an acute brain failure, is a common surgical complication experienced by approximately 50% of patients, incurring an estimated annual U
 S
 cost of $152 billion
1-4 As such, delirium is a crucial public health concern, as it is significantly associated with increased mortality5 and morbidity6, subsequent cognitive decline,7, 8 and loss of independence
5, 9 One in three cases of delirium may be preventable when multicomponent delirium prevention measures are implemented
10, 11 Implementation of such measures would likely be most efficient in high risk individuals, yet clinicians are encumbered by an arduous list of potential patient and perioperative risk factors to identify at risk individuals
 Prediction models facilitate the identification of high-risk individuals with the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) statistic, which is used to evaluate predictive ability to differentiate health and disease, with a value of 
5 being no better than chance and 
0 being perfect
 Our recent systematic review prediction models
12 While an AUROC of 
94 is excellent, that model includes postoperative data, which may be inflating model performance, thus invalidating its use as a preoperative prediction model
 Critically, we did not identify a prediction model for delirium severity in the literature
 A severity model may have the most utility, as it would identify patients who are likely to incur the severest delirium and therefore are most likely to benefit from a delirium prevention plan
 An ideal model that is clinically applicable would be predictive of delirium incidence and its severity as well as parsimonious, such that it would use a limited number of variables that can The ability to identify high-risk individuals prior to their surgery is critical to delirium prevention
 To identify potential candidate predictors, we considered the pathogenesis of delirium and sought to identify both predisposing (age, depression, and medical comorbidities) and precipitating (surgery) factors
 The Cognitive Disintegration Model posits that an individual with increasing risk, or vulnerability, to delirium will require less of a precipitating stimulus to cross over the Delirium Threshold and become delirious
13 This is illustrated in the cognitive trajectory in Figure 
 In contrast, an individual with less predisposing risk factors will require a large stimulus to precipitate delirium
 Hence, it is crucial to consider the future precipitating event into delirium prediction models when possible
 The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) online risk calculator14, 15 combines several comorbidities (that provide information on predisposing risk factors) and the estimated magnitude of the precipitating event, the surgery, to calculate risk of events
 The NSQIP risk score has been widely validated and applied to predict outcomes in various surgical populations, but has not been applied in delirium prediction
12, 16-19 We hypothesized that NSQIP risk of serious complications (NSQIP-SC) would be a stronger predictor of delirium over NSQIP risk of death (NSQIP-D) as the causal relationship between serious complications and delirium is likely stronger than the association between delirium and the risk of death
20 As delirium is a cognitive disorder, we further hypothesized that cognitive data (that is not included in NSQIP scores) could enhance the prediction of the surgical risk scores
 Indeed our recent systematic review identified that current delirium prediction models do not evaluate specific cognitive domains, incidence have been reported

 As shown in Figure 2, 100 subjects were recruited and 97 were included in the final analysis
 function, functional status, depression, and delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)
25 Executive function was assessed through two well- validated and widely used measures, Trail Making Test A (TMTA) and Trail Making Test B (TMTB)
26 These tests require participants to connect a series of circles in ascending order
 TMTA is composed of 25 encircled numbers; TMTB alternates between 23 encircled numbers and letters
 Scoring is based on time to completion; a longer completion time indicates worse executive function
 Raw scores were used in the analysis
 Functional ability was assessed using the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (iADL)
27 Depression was assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), which is composed of 15 yes/no questions and is widely validated in the older adult population
28 Demographic information included age, sex, years of education, and tobacco use history
 Data extracted from the electronic health record included preoperative blood pressure values, height, weight, past medical history including comorbidities, current outpatient medication use, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA) classification for the planned surgical procedure
 ASA classification ranges from 1-6 and is determined by the attending anesthesiologists prior to surgical intervention
29, 30 Each level has a specific definition with higher levels indicating increasing levels of disease, comorbidities and risk
 As vascular surgery is often associated with delirium,31 it was selected a priori to be included as a covariate to examine whether surgical type was sufficient to predict delirium or if the additional information provided by a surgical risk score was necessary for a prediction model
 Preoperative comorbidities as predisposing risk factors were assessed through the ASA score and Framingham was calculated through the online, interactive risk score calculator using data extracted from electronic health records and participant interview
 This calculator includes sex, age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), treatment for hypertension, current smoker, diabetes and BMI
 The most recent SBP value prior to surgery was used
 BMI was calculated from collected height/weight used to obtain the risk scores for serious complications (NSQIP-SC) and death (NSQIP-D)
 Risk is calculated from both predisposing factors and precipitating factors (Figure )
 This calculator employs twenty patient predictors and pairs these with the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, providing a risk score specific to each procedure

 The CAM and 3D-CAM were administered concurrently to provide both a global and comprehensive view of delirium symptoms while providing a structured interview format
 If the participant was CAM positive at the postoperative day 4 afternoon assessment, the participant was followed until delirium resolved to collect data on delirium duration
 If participants were ventilated in the intensive care unit (ICU), the CAM-ICU37, 38 was administered
 The DRS-R-98 (DRS) is a 16-item assessment tool that measures delirium symptoms and severity
 The maximum score is 44-points, an increasing score indicates worse delirium
36 The research team (RDS, HL, ST, JK, LT, PR, MD, BH) met at least weekly to discuss delirium assessment findings and DRS ratings
  Each research team member (RDS, HL, ST, JK, LT, PR, MD, BH) underwent intensive training on delirium interview completion including CAM, 3D-CAM, CAM-ICU, and DRS
 CAM training was completed as part of the NeuroVISION cohort study39 and the first author (HL) was officially trained on the CAM at the 2016 CEDARTREE Delirium Bootcamp and the CAM-ICU at the 2016 American Delirium Society pre-conference
 Team members viewed 6 videos on CAM and 3D-CAM administration from the Hospital Elder Life Program40 website followed by an interactive team discussion on CAM/3D- CAM completion and observations
 Team members shadowed the first author for six in-person CAM/3D-CAM assessments followed by in-depth discussion on observations, symptom rating (DRS), and bedside manner
 The first author shadowed the team members for six CAM/3D- CAM/CAM-ICU/DRS assessments to ensure The sample size was determined based on the need for a parsimonious delirium prediction model

 HL, First, to evaluate the predictive ability of NSQIP-SC over NSQIP-D (as composites of the predisposing and precipitating factors), logistic (DELYN) regression models were completed and compared also to ASA classification and Framingham risk (as measures of predisposing factors only)
 Second, a delirium prediction model was developed
 We did not employ univariate statistics to select candidate predictors as this may lead to poor performing predictors and overfitting
44 To counter the effects of small sample sizes and reduce bias within data, we employed a statistical shrinkage regression technique, using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)
45-47 This technique reduces the noise within the data, allowing true signals to be detected and avoids common problems such as model overfitting
 Candidate variables demonstrating the smallest Mallows Cp value,48 indicating precise predictors, were then applied in Best Subsets regression
 Best Subsets regression is an automated regression approach that evaluates all possible combinations of candidate predictors

 Model selection was based on assessment of model fit using Akaike information criteria (AIC), Bayesian information criteria (BIC), and McKelvey and Zavoinas Pseudo-R

 Forty-two percent experienced hypoactive delirium
 The median delirium duration was one day (24 hours)
 Participant characteristics are summarized in Table 
 Delirious patients had higher preoperative NSQIP risk scores of serious complications (NSQIP-SC) and death (NSQIP-D), worse executive function tests, were more likely to have had a vascular surgery, and higher ASA status (univariate, p<

 Significant pairwise correlations were demonstrated between the DRS and NSQIP-SC, NSQIP-D, TMTA and TMTB (univariate, p<
 )
 No significant differences were identified between the non-delirious and delirious groups in terms of age, sex, education level, past/present tobacco use, blood pressure metrics, We confirmed preoperative NSQIP-SC as a robust predictor of postoperative delirium incidence using single factor logistic regression models for NSQIP-SC and NSQIP-D
 Both demonstrated moderate to fair predictive ability with an AUROC of 
76 (95% CI: 
66, 
87) and 
73 (95% CI: 
 -
84), respectively
 Although similar in their projected ability to predict individuals at a higher risk for delirium development, support for the NSQIP-SC model, over the NSQIP-D model, is provided by optimal AIC (
086) and the BIC (-
254) metrics
 NSQIP-SC also performed better than the ASA classification (AUROC

 )
 The reported odds ratios, coefficients, AUROC, sensitivity and specificity, and model fit statistics including AIC and BIC are in In order to derive a potential delirium incidence prediction model we followed TRIPOD guidelines to apply a statistical shrinkage technique (LASSO) followed by Best Subsets regression using age, sex, NSQIP-SC, NSQIP-D, tobacco pack years, vascular surgery, ASA classification, Framingham CVD, GDS15, TMTA, TMTB, and blood pressure metrics
 A two-factor logistic regression model containing preoperative NSQIP-SC and TMTB to predict postoperative delirium incidence was selected as this model demonstrated optimal model fit accurate model calibration
 The model demonstrated moderate predictive ability (AUROC

 Similar to the logistic regression results above NSQIP-D was also significantly associated with DRS (p=

 Age, sex, NSQIP-D, ASA, tobacco pack years, vascular surgery, Framingham CVD, GDS15, TMTA, and blood pressure metrics Our analysis of a prospective perioperative cohort found NSQIP-SC to be a robust predictor of postoperative delirium incidence and severity
 The preoperative NSQIP-SC score combines data on both predisposing risk factors and the estimated magnitude of the surgery, i
 e
 the precipitating event and is well positioned to contribute information on the risk of delirium
 The addition of the executive function measure, TMT-B, improved performance of both prediction models
 Previous research has identified executive function to be significantly associated with delirium incidence
22-24 However, as identified by our recent systematic review of delirium prediction models in older adults, an executive function measure has not been applied previously
12 Given the breakdown in executive function during delirium and prior data on the predisposition to delirium by impaired cognition, incorporating a cognitive variable appears biologically important; our data show that it is statistically important too
 This study expands current knowledge by examining the utility of NSQIP risk scores and executive function in The NSQIP-D score was significantly associated with both postoperative delirium incidence and severity, however, it was not selected as a predictor in our variable selection
 Delirium often results from a complicated perioperative course, particularly following a major surgery, hence a relationship with NSQIP-SC is plausible
 Furthermore, a recent systematic review questioned the strength of the association between postoperative delirium and mortality, hence a priori we hypothesized that NSQIP-SC would perform better than NSQIP-D for predicting postoperative delirium incidence and severity
20 This was supported by several statistical measures in our dataset
 The modeling procedures, LASSO and Best Subsets regression, did not identify vascular burden, comorbidities, smoking history, and depression as important predictors although these variables have been identified as significant risk factors for postoperative delirium incidence in prior research
 This may be due to a number of factors
 First, their prevalence in this population of study may not be sufficient for prediction
 In order for a risk factor to also be an accurate predictor, it must be sufficiently prevalent in the at-risk population
53, 54 Secondly, late-life depression, vascular burden, and tobacco use often co-occur leading to overlapping data capture
 Variables that capture similar information fail to contribute important information during modeling procedures
12 Lastly, these variables contribute information on predisposing risk, but do not include valuable information on the future precipitating event, the planned surgical not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 The inclusion of information about the future precipitating event, as done in NSQIP-The strengths of this study include its prospective perioperative design, statistical methods chosen, and rigorous delirium assessments including outcomes based on incidence and severity of delirium
 This novel application of a readily available, simple tool has potential for broad application in delirium-focused clinical care
 The NSQIP-SC score combines several potential preoperative risk factors for delirium (age, functional status, current tobacco use, vascular burden) with the precipitating event, the planned surgery, and provides a single risk score that is easy to interpret, i
 e
, a 5 point increase in NSQIP-SC results in a 10% increase in the probability of a patient experiencing delirium
 Given that the patient becomes delirious postoperatively, quantifying the potential impact of this precipitating event is clearly a key feature of a delirium Delirium represents a severe breakdown in an individuals executive function
 The Cognitive Disintegration Model posits that there is a critical threshold (i
 e
 the Delirium Threshold) in cognition (or network connectivity) that must be crossed for delirium to result
 Individuals with more vulnerability (predisposing factors) going into surgery, i
 e
 older age, multiple comorbidities and worsening executive function, are closer to that Delirium Threshold (Figure 1) and may need a smaller precipitating event to push them into delirium
 In this context, inclusion of executive function, which is not captured in NSQIP-SC, improved model performance
 Furthermore, this simple two-factor model captures information on both the predisposing and precipitating factors for delirium
 Its parsimonious nature is a clinical strength
 This study has several limitations to consider
 While these models were built using statistical methods optimized for modeling a limited number of events, the small sample size may still have had an effect on the results
 The recommendations by the TRIPOD guidelines and the CHARMS checklist were followed to use statistical shrinkage procedures to minimize model overfitting
 Nonetheless, it is worth emphasizing the study sample is small with only 31 delirious participants
 The population is largely homogenous in terms of years of education and ethnicity
 In larger and more diverse populations, additional factors may enhance model performance
 Future studies should focus on the broad external validation of these models following the statistical methodology outlines by the TRIPOD guidelines
 This requires a new perioperative cohort study that will recruit patients from diverse populations and will be the target of future This analysis of a prospective perioperative cohort study identified NSQIP-SC and TMT-B as predictors for delirium incidence and severity
 A preliminary delirium prediction model was created for both delirium incidence and severity

 The relationship between cognitive abilities (predisposing, y axis) and the precipitating event, i
 e
 surgery over time (x-axis) is shown, with each individual trajectory displayed with a horizontal line
 The dashed line, situated above the x-axis of time, represents the Delirium Threshold
 (A) Trajectory #1 (gray line, numbered 1) displays an individual with maximum cognitive abilities
 They have a surgery, but do not cross the Delirium Threshold
 Trajectory #2 (blue line, numbered 2) contrasts #1 by showing an individual with decreased cognitive abilities
 This individual undergoes the same surgery and crosses over the Delirium Threshold to experience delirium
 (B) Trajectory #3 (black-dashed line, numbered 3) returns to an individual with maximum cognitive abilities
 A sufficiently large precipitating event will push this individual across the Delirium Threshold, inducing delirium
 Trajectory #1 (gray line) is transposed onto this graph to show the difference in magnitude and impact of the precipitating event
 (C) When developing a prediction model for delirium, it may be important to consider not only the predisposing risk factors, but also the influence of the precipitating event
 A surgical risk score such as NSQIP combines both predisposing risk and the future-precipitating event into Figure 2 displays the inclusion and exclusion criteria and a flowchart detailing study screening, recruitment, Figure 3 illustrates the predictive ability of the NSQIP-SC and TMTB model for postoperative delirium incidence
 (A) Displays the Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve statistic (AUROC)
 (B) Demonstrates the predicted probability of postoperative delirium incidence based on the % NSQIP-SC score
 This is holding TMTB constant at Figure 4 illustrates the postoperative delirium symptom severity prediction model
 Box A is a histogram showing the data distribution of the Peak Delirium Rating Scale Score (DRS)
 This value was transformed using the Box-Cox Method with an optimal lambda value of 
35 achieving a near Gaussian distribution and is shown on the histogram in Box B
 Boxes C-E display the predicted burden of delirium symptoms based on the NSQIP-SC and TMTB prediction model (Box C) and univariate analysis of NSQIP-SC (Box D) and TMTB (Box E)
 The statistics from each regression model are shown in the upper left hand corner of each box
 The univariate NSQIP-SC regression model was analyzed with 97 participants
 Due to one missing assessment of TMTB, Box C and E are analyzed with not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
