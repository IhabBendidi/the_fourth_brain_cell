 ;    Members of the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family are targeted by a significant fraction 27 of the available FDA-approved drugs
 However, the physiological role and pharmacological 28 properties of many GPCRs remain unknown, representing untapped potential in drug design
 Of 29 particular interest are ~100 less-studied GPCRs known as orphans because their endogenous 30 ligands are unknown
 Intriguingly, disease-causing mutations identified in patients, together with 31 animal studies, have demonstrated that many orphan receptors play crucial physiological roles, 32 The majority of deorphanized GPCRs demonstrate coupling to Gi/o, however a limited number of 35 techniques allow the detection of intrinsically small constitutive activity associated with Gi/o protein 36 activation which represents a significant barrier in our ability to study orphan GPCR signaling
 37 Using luciferase reporter assays, we effectively detected constitutive Gs, Gq, and G12/13 protein 38 signaling by unliganded receptors, and introducing various G protein chimeras, we provide a 39 novel, highly-sensitive tool capable of identifying Gi/o coupling in unliganded orphan GPCRs
 40 Using this approach, we measured the constitutive activity of the entire class C GPCR family that 42 includes 8 orphan receptors, and a subset of 20 prototypical class A GPCR members, including 43 11 orphans
 Excitingly, this approach illuminated the G protein coupling profile of 8 orphan GPCRs 44 (GPR22, GPR137b, GPR88, GPR156, GPR158, GPR179, GPRC5D, and GPRC6A) previously 45 We provide a new platform that could be utilized in ongoing studies in orphan receptor signaling 48 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 51  A new strategy to identify G protein signaling associated with orphan GPCRs
 53  Many orphan GPCRs are associated with pathological conditions and represent promising 56 The large family of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitutes the most exploited 60 drug target in the human genome (Hauser, Attwood, Rask-Andersen, Schioth, & Gloriam, 2017; 61 Sriram & Insel, )
 This is the result of GPCR involvement in the regulation of key physiological 62 processes combined with accessibility at the plasma membrane
 Nonetheless, the endogenous 63 ligands of many GPCRs have yet to be identified, which collectively are referred to as orphan 64 GPCRs (oGPCRs)
 In spite of the lack of known endogenous ligands, experimental evidence from 65 both animal models and human studies suggest that many oGPCRs regulate important 66 physiological processes and therefore represent attractive therapeutic targets that remain to be 67 exploited (Audo et al, 2012; Peachey et al, 2012; Wang et al, 2019; Watkins & Orlandi, )
 68 The first critical step towards the deorphanization of an oGPCR involves identifying the 69 intracellular signaling pathways that it modulates, thereby providing an essential readout to build 70 screening platforms aimed at testing receptor activation by candidate endogenous/synthetic 71 ligands
 However, the lack of known ligands significantly limits the experimental strategies that 72 can be applied to identify oGPCR-activated signaling pathways, thereby representing one of the 73 greatest difficulties in studying oGPCRs
 Although not widely utilized, one way to address this 74 question involves measuring the GPCR constitutive activity (Bond & Ijzerman, 2006; Ngo, 75 Coleman, & Smith, )
 Constitutive activity is observed when a GPCR produces spontaneous 76 G protein activation in the absence of agonist (Rosenbaum, Rasmussen, & Kobilka, 2009), a 77 property often observed when overexpressing GPCRs in heterologous systems and also detected 78 in vivo (Corder et al, 2013; Damian et al, 2012; Inoue et al, )
 Given that current available 79 assays have been unsuccessful in illuminating G protein coupling profiles for many oGPCRs, in 80 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    particular in detecting those dominantly coupling to Gi/o proteins, we sought to develop a novel 81 We generated a library of GPCRs that comprises the entire class C GPCR family and a 83 subset of class A members including a total of 19 oGPCRs for testing with several luciferase 84 reporter systems activated in response to G proteins stimulation
 Luciferase reporters are 85 characterized by high sensitivity and a wide dynamic range, allowing the detection of even minor 86 levels of G protein-initiated signaling pathways (Cheng et al, )
 These systems encode either 87 firefly luciferase or nanoluc under the control of inducible promoters downstream of the main G 88 protein-promoted signaling cascades
 G proteins are classified into four major families: Gs, Gq,  89 G12/13, and Gi/o
 In detail, activation of Gs family members (Gs/olf) stimulates adenylate cyclase to 90 produce cAMP that triggers downstream signaling events which activate the cAMP response 91 element (CRE)
 A primary effector of heterotrimeric Gq family members (Gq/11/14/15) is 92 phospholipase C (PLC) that catalyzes the formation of second messengers inositol 1,4,5-93 trisphosphate and diacylglycerol leading to the activation of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T-94 cells (NFAT) promoter
 The canonical downstream target of the heterotrimeric G12/13 proteins is a 95 group of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) that activate the Ras-family small 96 GTPase RhoA
 G12/13 activation can be detected by luciferase reporters using promoters 97 comprising a serum response element (SRE), or serum response factor response element (SRF-98 RE), with the last one designed to respond to SRF-dependent and ternary complex factor (TCF)-99 independent pathways (Cheng et al, )
 Conversely, detection of active G proteins belonging 100 to the Gi/o family (Gi1/i2/i3/o/z/t) is more complicated and elusive
 In fact, the main effect of Gi/o 101 stimulation consists in the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, leading to a reduction of the cAMP 102 production
 Changes in cAMP levels can be readily detected after agonist-stimulation of Gi/o-103 coupled GPCRs, however, determining the constitutive activity of such receptors has proven 104 challenging
 Moreover, according to the GPCR database (Flock et al, 2017; Pandy-Szekeres et 105 (64%) can activate members of the Gi/o protein family, with half of them, 79 out of 247 (32%), 107 showing exclusive coupling to Gi/o
 Considering the likely large number of Gi/o-coupled receptors 108 among oGPCRs, research in this field is in desperate need of innovative sensitive tools
 109 To overcome this issue, we took advantage of previously developed G protein chimeras 110 (Ballister, Rodgers, Martial, & Lucas, 2018; Conklin, Farfel, Lustig, Julius, & Bourne, 1993; Inoue 111 et al, 2019), and generated novel G protein chimeras to expand the GPCR toolkit
 Swapping the 112 C-terminal strand of amino acids of any G protein with those of Gi/o family members enables 113 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Exploiting such property, we rerouted 116 pathways initiated by the constitutive activation of Gi/o-coupled receptors to different downstream 117 signaling outcomes which are more readily measurable
 Herein, we tested 8 G protein chimeras 118 against a set of 8 well-characterized Gi/o-coupled receptors for a total of 64 combinations to 119 identify the most suitable ones for analysis of constitutive activity across our oGPCR library
 120 Applying this strategy we successfully identified 8 oGPCRs that show significant basal activation 121 of Gi/o proteins
 We finally validated these results by measuring the inhibition of forskolin-induced 122 cAMP production by an oGPCR showing high Gi/o constitutive activity, GPR

1 Screening of GPCR constitutive activity using luciferase reporter assays
 245 Taking advantage of a plasmid cDNA library encoding the entire 22 class C GPCRs, including 8 246 oGPCRs, and a subset of 19 class A GPCRs, including 11 oGPCRs, we systematically tested 247 their constitutive activity using several luciferase reporter assays and setting an arbitrary threshold 248 of 3 fold-increase for positive signals (Figure )
 We first screened the library for Gq activation by 249 co-transfecting HEK293T cells with each GPCR and a NFAT-RE luciferase reporter (Figure a)
 250 As expected, the positive controls serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A), muscarinic receptor 1 251 (CHRM1), and the metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 and 5 (GRM1 and GRM5) showed the 252 highest signal compared to control cells expressing only the luciferase reporter
 None of the 253 oGPCRs tested showed any constitutive activation of Gq-dependent signaling pathways (Figure 254 a)
 Similarly, using a CRE reporter assay for Gs activation, we detected the constitutive activity 255 of 2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), serotonin receptor 4 (HTR4), and dopamine receptor D1 256 (DRD1) (Figure b)
 Interestingly, some Gq-coupled receptors also triggered the expression of 257 luciferase activating the CRE reporter, while all the oGPCRs showed levels of activation 258 comparable to those of the control not expressing GPCRs (Figure b)
 Using the same approach 259 with two additional luciferase reporters SRE and SRF-RE, we detected the constitutive activity of 260 the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 2 (LPAR2) downstream of G12/13 (Figure c-d)
 Again, no 261 constitutive luciferase expression by oGPCRs was detected (Figure c-d)
 Overall, these 262 experiments revealed that luciferase reporters are sensitive enough to detect GPCR activity in 263 the absence of ligand application for some GPCRs; however, none of the 19 oGPCRs tested 264 showed any constitutive activation of Gq, Gs, or G12/13 signaling pathways
 265 
2 G protein chimeras are valuable tools to detect constitutive activity of Gi/o-coupled 266 After exploring our GPCR library for the activation of signaling pathways downstream of Gs, Gq, 268 and G12/13, we focused on Gi/o signaling
 In principle, the CRE luciferase reporter could be used 269 to detect activation of Gi/o-coupled GPCRs as a reduction in cAMP levels, however its use is 270 limited by a low dynamic range
 This especially applies to measurements of GPCR constitutive 271 activity, as they are intrinsically small
 Therefore, to obtain a reliable quantification of constitutive 272 activation of Gi/o signaling, we tested several G protein chimeras based on Gq or Gs core protein 273 and bearing the C-terminus of either Gi1, Gi3, Go, or Gz (Figure a)
 The last few amino acids in 274 the G protein C-terminus define most of the GPCR coupling selectivity (Ballister et al, 2018; 275 Conklin et al, 1993; Inoue et al, )
 However, the coupling efficiency of G protein chimeras 276 is variable and depends on the GPCR analyzed (Ballister et al, 2018; Conklin et al, 1993; Inoue 277 et al, )
 Thus, we tested 5 chimeras based on a Gq core and 3 chimeras based on a Gs core 278 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    for their ability to stimulate NFAT or CRE luciferase reporters, respectively
 As a control, we first 279 quantified the amount of luciferase expressed in cells where each chimera was co-transfected 280 with the associated luciferase reporter but without GPCR overexpression
 We reasoned that the 281 difference in luciferase expression obtained comparing cells expressing the reporter with or 282 without expression of the G protein chimeras could represent an index of reporter activation by 283 endogenously expressed Gi/o-coupled receptors
 As a positive control, we co-transfected GRM2 284 because of its reported high constitutive activity (Doornbos et al, 2018) (Figure b-c)
 We found 285 that expression of Gq-based chimeras only produced a negligible amount of NFAT reporter 286 induction (
1-fold increase on average) (Figure 2b), while we observed an average of 83-fold 287 increase in CRE-induced luciferase expression using the Gs-based chimeras (Figure c)
 As 288 expected, expression of GRM2 significantly induced the luciferase expression with all of the 289 chimeras tested (Figure b-c)
 The fold-change observed normalizing the GRM2 constitutive 290 activity over the no-GPCR control, revealed comparable levels of activation between Gq and Gs 291 chimeras
 Interestingly, the GqGi3 chimera showed a 
3  
5 fold-increase, being the highest 292 amplitude among all the chimeras, while both the GqGz and the GsGz chimeras showed only a 
7 293  
6 and 
8  
4 fold-increase (Figure b-c)
 To explore the efficiency of activation of these G 294 protein chimeras, we then quantified the constitutive activity of eight GPCRs that are known to 295 primarily couple to Gi/o (Flock et al, 2017; Pandy-Szekeres et al, 2018): class C GRM2, GRM3, 296 GRM4, GRM6, GRM7, GRM8, and class A ADRA2A and HTR1A (Figure d)
 Assuming an 297 arbitrary threshold of 3 fold-increase as a positive signal, our data show that some GPCR 298 constitutive activity can be detected with the majority of the chimeras (i
 e
 GRM2), while some 299 GPCRs show levels of activation above the threshold only if co-transfected with GsGi1 or GsGo 300 chimeras (i
 e
 GRM7 and GRM)
 According to earlier reports, the signal amplitude is GPCR-301 dependent (Conklin et al, 1993), and here we show it is undetectable for a subset of GPCR (i
 e
 302 ADRAA)
 We next asked if the absence of signal for ADRA2A could be due to a lack of 303 constitutive activity or to the expression of a non-functional receptor
 Using a Bioluminescence 304 Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) assay we tested the ligand activation of the G protein 305 chimeras by ADRA2A (Figure a)
 Here, we activated the ADRA2A receptor with the endogenous 306 agonist norepinephrine at a concentration of 1 M
 We compared the BRET ratio obtained using 307 G protein chimeras with those obtained with wild type Gi1, Gi3, Go, and Gz proteins (Figure b-d)
 308 Although the amplitude of the BRET signal generated by the G protein chimeras was smaller 309 compared to the signal produced by wild type G protein, our data show that ADRA2A can indeed 310 activate every tested chimera
 Overall, we provide evidence that ADRA2A lacks detectable levels 311 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    of constitutive activity
 Likewise, we expect that the constitutive activity of some of the oGPCRs 312 Agonist-activation of a subset of Gi/o coupled receptors, M4R, D2R, 2AAR, and A1R, using G 315 protein chimeras was previously reported to be strongly dependent on both the Gi/o protein core 316 and the Gi/o C-terminus (Okashah et al, )
 However, among the possible combinations of G 317 protein cores and C-termini, it was established that chimeras based on Gs could be triggered by 318 Gi/o coupled receptors more easily than chimeras bearing the core of Gq or G12/13 (Okashah et al, 319 )
 Our data on 8 control GPCRs suggest similar preference pattern, with Gs chimeras being 320 more promiscuous than Gq chimeras (Figure d)
 We thus screened our oGPCR library for 321 constitutive activation of GsGi1 and GsGo chimeras normalizing the luciferase signal to that 322 obtained in cells transfected only with the luciferase reporters but no G protein chimeras (Figure 323 a-b)
 Excitingly, this optimized assay indicated that 8 of the 19 oGPCRs examined can indeed 324 activate Gi/o proteins
 Specifically, we confirmed previously identified Gi/o coupling for the orphan 325 receptors GPR22 (Adams et al, 2008), GPR88 (Dzierba et al, 2015; Jin et al, 2014) and 326 GPRC6A (Pi, Parrill, & Quarles, 2010), even though some reports failed to reproduce Gi/o coupling 327 for GPRC6A (Jacobsen et al, )
 Moreover, we revealed previously unreported robust and 328 significant constitutive activity for GPR156 (
94  
40 fold increase over control using the GsGi1 329 chimera), GPR137b (
05  
45), GPR158 (
87  
32), GPR179 (

55), and GPRC5D 330 The lack of signal obtained transfecting several oGPCRs with any of the tested luciferase 332 reporters may be due to a variety of factors
 For example, we demonstrated that ADRA2A receptor 333 was functional in activating wild type or chimeric G proteins (Figure 3b-d), but did not produce a 334 detectable basal G protein signaling (Figure 2d) pointing at a very low level of constitutive activity
 335 Alternatively, the absence of signal could depend on DNA constructs that do not express 336 adequate levels of GPCRs
 To test this possibility, we analyzed the expression of our oGPCR 337 library at the protein level by western blot using antibodies directed against C-terminus HA-tag 338 (Figure 4c-d) or myc-tag (Figure e)
 Immunoblots revealed that the expression levels of GPR85 339 and GPR137 were below detectable threshold, thus providing a possible explanation for their lack 340 Adenylate cyclase represents one of the main intracellular effectors for both Gs and Gi protein 343 signaling, with Gs stimulating cAMP production and Gi inhibiting it

 ;    measuring Gi/o constitutive activation by oGPCRs shown in figure 4, we quantified the reduction 345 in cAMP levels induced by treatment with the adenylate cyclase stimulant forskolin in cells 346 overexpressing GPR156, GRM2 or GPRCB
 Using a co-transfected cAMP sensor, we were able 347 to obtain real time measurements of cAMP changes (Figure a)
 As expected, we found that 348 forskolin stimulation of cAMP levels was not affected by overexpression of GPRC5B (
8  349 
5% of CNT; p = 
622); while overexpression of the positive control GRM2 (
6  
7% of CNT) 350 or the orphan receptor GPR156 (
7  
2% of CNT) significantly blunted the effect of forskolin 351 (Figure a-b)
 These results confirmed the earlier identified Gi/o coupling and high constitutive 352 activity for GPR156, as well as the lack of Gi/o signaling for GPRCB
 353 The unique properties of each GPCR together with the plethora of signaling cascades 356 activated makes the development of tailor-made assays a prerequisite for future attempts at 357 profiling oGPCR signaling
 Many efforts have been made to create a universal platform for high-358 throughput screening of GPCR signaling that is independent of G protein coupling (Inoue et al, 359 2012; Kroeze et al, )
 For example, the use of quantitative techniques to measure -arrestin 360 recruitment as a general readout of GPCR activation led to the identification of a number of 361 compounds within a library of 446 molecules acting as agonists or antagonists for class A 362 oGPCRs (Kroeze et al, )
 However, despite the ability of class C GPCR members to recruit 363 -arrestins (Iacovelli, Felicioni, Nistico, Nicoletti, & De Blasi, 2014; Mos, Jacobsen, Foster, & 364 Brauner-Osborne, 2019; Mundell, Matharu, Pula, Roberts, & Kelly, 2001; Stoppel et al, 2017), 365 attempts to use this approach to deorphanize this subfamily of oGPCRs were unsuccessful 366 (Kroeze et al, )
 Similarly, the use of cell-based assays expressing G protein chimeras in G 367 protein knock out cell lines to measure ligand-activated GPCR signaling has recently found a 368 number of applications (Inoue et al, 2019; Okashah et al, )
 Overall, we expect that a single 369 readout would never be sufficient to detect the activation of every oGPCR without possibly 370 omitting important ligand-receptor pairs
 In fact, successful screening efforts will probably need to 371 include multiple alternative readouts
 A systematic parallel analysis of GPCR constitutive activity 372 represents a powerful strategy to begin understanding the cell signaling pathways modulated by 373 oGPCRs
 Using a novel approach combining luciferase reporter assays with G protein chimeras, 374 here we detected Gi/o protein activation by several oGPCRs in absence of ligand stimulation, 375 thereby providing the first evidence for G protein coupling-preference for multiple oGPCRs
 This 376 information is crucial in the deorphanization process, as it provides a novel readout in designing 377 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    platforms to test the activation of oGPCRs allowing for the analysis of libraries of synthetic or 378 In the present study, we did not found evidence of Gs, Gq, or G12/13 coupling for any of the 380 19 oGPCRs analyzed, nevertheless, we confirmed Gi/o coupling for GPR22, GPR88, and 381 GPRCA
 Strikingly, we observed previously unappreciated Gi/o constitutive activities for 382 GPR137b, GPR156, GPR158, GPR179, and GPRCD
 GPR137b expression is restricted to 383 heart, liver, kidney and brain, and it is one of the few GPCRs enriched at lysosomal membranes 384 (Gan et al, 2019; Gao et al, )
 Proteomics studies of lysosomal membranes also identified 385 several G protein signaling elements including Gi2, G1, and G2 (Callahan, Bagshaw, & 386 Mahuran, )
 The functional consequences of activating Gi/o signaling responses at the 387 lysosomal membrane remain to be characterized
 The group of Pangalos suggested that the class 388 C orphan GPR156 could possibly act as a third GABAB receptor subunit because of their 389 significant sequence homology (Calver et al, )
 However, functional assays failed to reveal 390 any activation in response to treatments with GABAB receptor agonists in cells expressing 391 GPR156 alone or co-expressing GPR156 with GABAB1 or GABAB2 receptors (Calver et al, )
 392 Searching for alternative ligands, a calcium mobilization assay was used to screen a library of 393 2500 endogenous GPCR agonists without success (Calver et al, )
 The extremely high 394 constitutive activity of GPR156 could result in a low dynamic range when performing functional 395 screens and therefore limit the chances to identify possible agonists
 At the same time, a high 396 constitutive activity can be a useful tool for the identification of inverse agonists that represent 397 attractive compounds for multiple pharmacotherapies (Berg & Clarke, 2018; Bond & Ijzerman, 398 2006; Chen et al, )
 Our screening also revealed Gi/o constitutive activation for both GPR158 399 and GPR179, highly homologous class C receptors
 GPR158 is abundantly expressed in several 400 neuronal populations in the brain where it regulates stress-induced depression (Orlandi et al, 401 2012; Orlandi, Sutton, Muntean, Song, & Martemyanov, 2019; Sutton et al, )
 While, 402 GPR179 is specifically expressed in the ON-bipolar neurons of the retina (Audo et al, 2012; 403 Orlandi et al, 2012; Peachey et al, )
 Point mutations in GPR179 gene were identified in 404 patients with congenital stationary night blindness and further animal studies revealed its essential 405 role in night vision (Audo et al, 2012; Peachey et al, 2012; Ray et al, )
 At the molecular 406 level, both GPR158 and GPR179 has been shown to interact and modulate the activity of a family 407 of R7 Regulator of G protein signaling (R7-RGS) proteins (Orlandi et al, )
 At the same time 408 GPR179 acts as a scaffold for many components of the post-synaptic mGluR6-Go-TRPM1 409 signaling complex (Orlandi, Cao, & Martemyanov, )
 Moreover, their long extracellular N-410 termini have been shown to interact with extracellular matrix components to form trans-synaptic 411 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    complexes (Condomitti et al, 2018; Dunn, Orlandi, & Martemyanov, 2019; Orlandi et al, )
 412 Our results here indicate that GPR158 and GPR179 can simultaneously activate G proteins of 413 the Gi/o family while scaffolding R7-RGS proteins, which act as GTPase activating proteins (GAP) 414 for a subset of Gi/o family members to terminate the G protein signal These complexes may be 415 required for the timely inactivation of G proteins in response to extracellular events thus limiting 416 the diffusion of activated G proteins to a restricted post-synaptic microenvironment
 Alternatively, 417 this receptor complex configuration may limit the diversity of G proteins activated by GPR158 and 418 GPR179 to a subset of Gi/o family members that are not a suitable substrate for R7-RGS proteins 419 such as Gz
 Further studies are needed to investigate the molecular implications of G protein 420 activation by GPR158 in the brain and GPR179 in the retina
 The involvement of GPR158 in 421 stress-induced depression makes it an ideal target for development of a novel antidepressants, a 422 desperately needed class of pharmaceuticals
 While GPR179 loss of function in congenital 423 stationary night blindness, a debilitating disease without current available treatments, makes it 424 also a relevant candidate for drug discovery ventures
 Finally, we detected a previously 425 unreported Gi/o coupling for GPRC5D, the last identified member of the class C retinoic acid-426 inducible receptor family (Brauner-Osborne et al, )
 GPRC5D is mostly expressed in 427 peripheral tissues and it has recently been associated with cancer (Atamaniuk et al, 2012; Smith 428 et al, )
 Specifically, its expression was found to be elevated on the surface of malignant 429 cells involved in multiple myeloma, and it represents a viable target for chimeric antigen receptor 430 (CAR) T cell immunotherapy of multiple myeloma (Kodama et al, 2019; Smith et al, )
 The 431 discovery of signaling pathways triggered by GPRC5D represents therefore an important step 432 forward in the development of therapeutic treatments for white blood plasma cell cancer
 433 In summary, here we provided a new sensitive strategy to profile constitutive Gi/o protein 434 coupling for understudied orphan GPCRs
 This approach represents a fundamental advancement 435 in the deorphanization process and will likely accelerate the search for novel GPCR ligands
 By 436 screening the entire class C GPCR family, we discovered or confirmed Gi/o coupling for 5 out of 437 the 8 orphan members, and, similarly, we revealed 3 Gi/o coupled receptors within a subset of 438 class A oGPCRs
 Several of these oGPCRs are associated with debilitating neuropsychiatric 439 disorders or they are relevant for treatment of numerous cancers
 Hence, improving our 440 understanding of the biology of such receptors has clinical relevance and it is essential in the drug 441 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 G protein chimera activation by agonist-activated GPCRs using BRET assay
 (a)Schematic representation of the BRET assay used to detect agonist-induced activation ofADRAA
 Norepinephrine application triggers the GDP exchange with GTP on the G subunitand the subsequent dissociation of G-Venus
 At the membrane, released G will interact withthe C-terminus of masGRK3 that is fused with Nanoluc
 Using a BMG Omega plate reader wecan therefore detect the BRET signal generated
 (b) Representative response profile showing theBRET signal after norepinephrine application at 5 seconds
 The BRET ratio is calculated foreach of the wild type Gi1 and Gi3, or the chimeric G proteins bearing a Gi1 or Gi3 C-terminus
 (c)Norepinephrine activation of wild type Go or G protein chimeras with a Go C-terminus
 (d)Norepinephrine activation of wild type Gz or G protein chimeras with a Gz C-terminus
