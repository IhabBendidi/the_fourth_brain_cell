 Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of haematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization in a group of Crohn's disease patients preparing for autologous unselected haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a single institution
 This is the first study to Methods: Patients were selected according to criteria of the European Bone Marrow Results: All patients mobilized with the mean number of haematopoietic progenitor cells leukapheresis session to reach the ideal number of cells
 Grafting occurred around ten days after cells infusion
 Complications and adverse events during the mobilization period were rare with only one patient presenting sepsis as a relevant event in the period

 ;    Crohn's disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease of unknown aetiology but with a proven immune component, has an unpredictable, heterogeneous, chronic, and severe course that It is most commonly observed in the industrialized countries of Western Europe, North America, and both Australia and New Zealand, which were colonized by Europeans
 The frequency of the disease is increasing in the 21st century; it is becoming progressively more common in the countries of Eastern Europe, Asia, South America and Africa as a result of the The clinical picture is varied but patients usually evolve with crises of fever, abdominal pain and diarrhoea that are sometimes uncontrollable, in addition to anorexia, emaciation and haematochezia
 Anal involvement, which may be the initial manifestation of the disease, is present in about 15-30% of the patients
 Fistulas, stenosis and intestinal occlusion make up the complex spectrum of the disease
 Extra-intestinal manifestations may occur, as well as the biological agents, which are used alone or in combinations (4) ()
 Surgical interventions are frequent and it is estimated that more than 50% of patients will have undergone some type of surgical procedure within five years of the onset of the disease
 Another point to be emphasized is that after an initial intervention, there is an increased probability of further surgical procedures ()

 ;    HSCT is a therapy that has been used to treat autoimmune diseases since the mid-1990s ()
 Clinical remissions, both with autologous and allogeneic HSCT in patients with CD concomitant with lymphomas or leukaemias (7) (8) (9), paved the way for the first exclusive procedures The objective of autologous HSCT is immunological reprogramming with the elimination or reduction of autoreactive lymphocytes and the prospect of inducing a state of tolerogenicity in The procedure begins with a mobilization phase, usually with cyclophosphamide (Cy) and progenitor cells (HPC) from the peripheral blood (PB) that will be re-infused after conditioning with Cy and rabbit or horse anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)
 PB-HPC in HSCT with a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen is able to provide hematologic support to reduce the period of neutropenia and thus minimize the risk of infections in this period ()
 To evaluate the results of HPC mobilization in a group of Crohn's disease patients at a single The criteria consists of active disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index above 150, Harvey & Bradshaw score above 4 and Craig Crohn's Disease Severity score above 17) in addition to the presence of endoscopic evidence of lesions of the digestive tract and refractoriness or intolerance to the use of at least two biological agents
 As an additional criterion, the imminent risk of surgery such as rectal amputation or colostomy and non-acceptance of the patient to perform surgery

 Partial data of this series have been published previously The criteria for selecting patients for HSCT were those recommended by the EBMT (18) (19) as 1) Disease activity: Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) with a score above 150, Harvey & Bradshaw Index (HBi) above 4, Craig Disease Severity Index (CCSI) above 17; 2) Proven endoscopic lesion of the digestive tract related to the disease and 3) Refractoriness or intolerance to the use of at least two biological agents

 Moreover, the clinical parameters of the disease, history and characteristics of the patients prior to HSCT were investigated, as were relevant clinical events and toxicity data observed during mobilization
 All results and data were compared to other HSCT studies for CD in respect to the Cy and G-CSF doses, graft composition (selected or unselected), number of cells The mobilization regimen consisted in a single dose of Cy (2 g/m(filgrastim 10 mcg/kg/day) starting five days after the administration of the Cy and maintained until the end of the harvesting of PB-HPC

 Sixteen female and 13 male patients with a mean age of 
8 years were included
 Twenty-one (

 Of the eight patients with anal involvement, seven were submitted to mobilization for HSCT with ostomies
 The majority of the patients had a history of surgeries and a minority were smokers
 There were no reports of family cases of CD in this series

 Figures 1-c and -d shows, using Pearson correlation analysis, that there is no difference in the results of transplanting selected or unselected cells and in the Cy dose used for mobilization

 Table 4 lists the mobilization data from other autologous HSCT studies
 Autologous HSCT is a well-established procedure for the treatment of different hematologic malignancies and selected solid tumours and has become an option in the treatment of autoimmune diseases (29) ()
 However, a number of concerns persist with regard to the mobilization regime ()
 These issues include the choice of chemotherapy and administered doses, use of cytokines such as G-CSF and Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as well as the manipulation or not of the cells to be infused, the acceptable number of leukapheresis sessions and the criteria to begin harvesting the PB-HPC
 Furthermore, new issues are arising such as the emergence of new agents such as the CXCL4 antagonist, AMD plerixafor, which is directed towards poor mobilizing patients and its pre-emptive use in cases certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    It is consensus that failure to mobilize is defined when a minimum number of 
0 x cells/Kg is not harvested in four leukapheresis sessions
 The ultimate goal of collection for a session is not obtained, the patient must undergo further leukapheresis sessions in order to reach the target number
 A marginal collection is considered when the number of collected cells in the first session is less than 
0 x Grafting is defined as the first day that the neutrophil count recovers to values greater than 
5 /L in the PB with this number being maintained for two consecutive days
 These criteria have been supported by publications since the last century, including guidelines and the extensive literature that permeates the mobilization procedures for autologous and allogeneic HSCT in the treatment of malignant haematological diseases ()
 This does not necessarily apply to HSCT for autoimmune diseases
 The reports found are old and do not The study by Burt et al in 2001 was the first to address this subject by investigating data on stem cell collection of 187 patients from 24 centres in Asia, Australia, Europe and North America to determine the evolution, methods, effects on disease activity, and complications that might occur due to the procedure ()
 Cases of multiple sclerosis predominated in the study, followed by rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma and systemic lupus erythematosus
 Few cases of other diseases have also been reported, but there is no mention of CD
 It should be remembered that the first reports of HSCT specifically for CD appeared after 2003 (10) ()
 The investigation by Blanck et al, the second study to address this theme, evaluated 35 patients, 15 of whom had systemic sclerosis, 11 had multiple sclerosis and nine had other autoimmune diseases, and provided information on mobilization in these diseases (33) ()

 ;    Mobilization regimens use various chemotherapeutic agents including Cy and etoposide, or combinations of drugs such as dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine and cisplatin (DHAP), or etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine & cisplatin (ESHAP) with the aim of reducing tumour mass and improving the results of mobilization when the goal is to treat malignant Cy is the main chemotherapeutic agent used in mobilization regimes
 Doses range from 2-7  depending on the disease with great variability in toxicity
 High doses of Cy cause high In the first study, despite demonstrating a great variability in the regimens employed, the use of CY associated to G-CSF was shown to be the preferred regimen for mobilization in The second study confirmed this preference and reported that low doses of CY associated with multiple doses of G-CSF was effective in mobilizing PB-HPC ()
 The dose of Cy was 4 g/mWhen the mobilization regimes for CD are observed, the rule is the use of Cy and G-CSF (Table observed that there was no advantage in using the 4 g/m in addition to conferring greater toxicity to patients with CD (27) (34) does not provide benefits in the final counts of cells obtained (Table )
 However, the question of the best mobilization regime for autoimmune diseases, including CD still lacks consensus ()
 To support this statement, we highlight the recent proposal to  (35) as a result of warnings about toxicity in HSCT for CD (20) certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 The results of this study suggest that the reduction of Cy in the conditioning regime can Another aspect regarding mobilization is related to the use of G-CSF
 The literature describes differences in results depending on the origin of G-CSF (lenograstim, pegfilgrastim or filgrastim) ()
 There are also questions about the varying doses used in different mobilization regimens that generally range from 5-10 mcg/kg/day but can occasionally go up to 16 mcg/kg/day
 This higher dose apparently makes little difference to the final volume of cells collected ()
 Hence, in all CD mobilization studies, the usual dose is 10 mcg/kg/day (in our case filgrastim) and always associated with Cy
 This is due to reports of flares or exacerbation in patients with other types of autoimmune diseases submitted to HSCT ()
 In respect to CD, there are no references or attempts to use G-CSF alone in mobilization, or the use of GM-CSF or an association with thrombopoietin as described in mobilization regimens for malignant The number of cells collected and made available for reinfusion is critical to the success of HSCT, as it reduces the period of aplasia and transfusion requirements, and promotes grafting
 This was evident in our study, as well as in those described in Table 4, with no failure of CD patients do not present harvesting difficulties similar to other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and in particular patients with systemic sclerosis where marginal collections or failures were observed due to intramedullary fibrosis and reduction of bone marrow microvasculature
(39) On comparing the present work with other published studies, it appears that the composition of the cells infused during HSCT, whether manipulated or not, is unimportant to the outcome certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    The rate of adverse events was low in our series, just one case of sepsis
 Moreover, the transfusion requirements, restricted to packed red blood cell transfusions, was low despite the fact that most of the patients had anaemia throughout the mobilization period
 Thus, we can conclude that CD patients are good mobilizers for HSCT
 The dose of Cy should  and it is necessary to have a dose-reduction study to see if the goal of
