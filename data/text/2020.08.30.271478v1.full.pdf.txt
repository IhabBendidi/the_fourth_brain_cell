 ;    The article describes a quick protocol to gonadectomize and sample blood from small 33 teleost fish, using medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a model, to investigate the role of sex 34 Sex steroids, produced by the gonads, play an essential role in the neuroendocrine 38 control of reproduction in all vertebrates by providing feedback to the brain and pituitary
 39 Sex steroids also play an important role in tissue plasticity by regulating cell proliferation 40 in several tissues including the brain and the pituitary
 Therefore, investigating the role of 41 sex steroids and mechanisms by which they act is crucial to better understand both 42 feedback mechanism and tissue plasticity
 Teleost fish, which possess a higher degree of 43 tissue plasticity and variations in reproduction strategies compared to mammals, appear 44 to be useful models to investigate these questions
 The removal of the main source of sex 45 steroid production using gonadectomy together with blood sampling to measure steroid 46 levels, have been well-established and fairly feasible in bigger fish and are powerful 47 techniques to investigate the role and effects of sex steroids
 However, small fish such as 48 zebrafish and medaka, which are particularly good model organisms considering the well-49 developed genetic toolkit and the numerous protocols available to investigate their 50 biology and physiology, raise challenges for applying such protocols due to their small 51 size
 Here, we demonstrate the step-by-step procedure of gonadectomy in both males 52 and females followed by blood sampling in a small sized teleost model, the Japanese 53 medaka (Oryzias latipes)
 The use of these procedures combined with the other 54 advantages of using these small teleost models will greatly improve our understanding of 55 feedback mechanisms in the neuroendocrine control of reproduction and tissue plasticity 56 In vertebrates, sex steroids, which are mainly produced by the gonads, play 62 important roles in the regulation of the Brain-Pituitary-Gonadal (BPG) axis through 63 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    Despite a relatively good knowledge in mammals, mechanism of BPG axis 68 regulation mediated by sex steroids is far from being understood in non-mammalian 69 species, leading to poor understanding of evolutionary conserved principles (reviewed in 70 )
 Besides, there is still a limited number of studies documenting the role of sex steroids 71 on brain and pituitary plasticity, thus raising the need for further investigations of the 72 role and effects of sex steroids on diverse vertebrate species
 73 Among vertebrates, teleosts have become powerful model animals in addressing 74 numerous biological and physiological questions, including stress response (reviewed in 75 )
 Teleosts, in which sex steroids are mostly represented by estradiol (E2) in 77 experimental models for investigating the general principle of reproduction across 79 species
 Also, teleosts possess unique characteristics in their hypothalamus and pituitary, 80 which are sometimes convenient for the elucidation of regulatory mechanisms
 For 81 instance, they show direct pituitary innervation of hypophysiotropic neurons in the brain 82 their gonadotropins (luteinizing and follicle stimulating hormones) are produced in two 84 to both laboratory and field experiments, teleosts offer many advantages compared to 88 other organisms
 They are relatively inexpensive to purchase and maintain (reviewed in 89 )
 In particular, small teleost models, such as zebrafish and medaka, are species with 90 very high fecundity and relatively short life cycle enabling rapid analysis of gene function 91 and disease mechanisms , thus providing even greater advantages in addressing a 92 developed protocols and genetic tools available for these species (reviewed in (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    In numerous studies, the removal of gonads (gonadectomy), the main source of 95 sex steroid production, has been used as a method for investigating many physiological 96 questions, including its impact in vertebrate reproductive physiology, including in 97 aimed for quantifying circulating hormone levels, including those of sex steroids Together, these two techniques have shown their importance in a great number of 100 studies, including the investigation of feedback mechanisms and the effect of sex steroids 101 easy to perform in bigger species, such as European sea bass , they raise challenges when applied in smaller fishes, such as zebrafish 104 and medaka
 Therefore, a clear protocol demonstrating every step of gonadectomy and 105 Here, we use Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a model, a small freshwater 107 fish native to East Asia, and similar to zebrafish in many aspects (size, genome sequenced, 108 molecular and genetic tools available)
 However, medaka has a smaller genome size than 109  and a genetic sex determination system allowing for investigation of 110 sexual differences before second sexual characters or gonads are well developed 111 This paper demonstrates gonadectomy and blood sampling in small teleost 113 models, a technique that takes only 8 minutes in total and that will complete the list of 114 detailed video protocols already existing for this species that included labeling of blood 115 
 This technique will allow the research community to investigate and better 117 understand the roles of sex steroids in feedback mechanisms as well as brain and 118 All experimentations and animal handling were conducted in accordance with the 122 recommendations on the experimental animal welfare at Norwegian University of Life 123 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 For sex steroid 247 analysis such as E2 or 11KT, 1 ul of collected blood is adequate for the analysis
 The 248 blood can be diluted in 1X PBS and extract steroids with diethyl ether or 249 dichloromethane if necessary
  In many previous studies, clot was removed, however, as 250 the volume of blood is so small that we can ignore the effects in most cases
 251 This protocol describes every step for performing gonadectomy and blood 255 sampling in small sized teleosts, using the Japanese medaka as a model
 The survival rate 256 of the fish after ovariectomy (OVX) in females is 100% (10 out of 10 fish) while 94% (17 257 out of 18 fish) of the males survived after orchidectomy
 Meanwhile, after blood sampling 258 Sham-operated females show oviposition (Figure 6A) and all the eggs are fertilized 260 and allow for embryonic development (Figure B)
 Sham operated males are also able to 261 fertilize eggs after only a couple of weeks
 Similarly, partly-gonadectomized females 262 reared with partly-gonadectomized males also show oviposition and showed 100% of 263 fertilized eggs after 2 months
 In contrast, no oviposition in females or fertilization by 264 males could be observed in fully gonadectomized fish, even after 4 months

 ;    When performed correctly, the body shape of the fish slightly changes (Figure A)
 266 If performed correctly, no piece of gonad should remain after the gonadectomy 267 (Figure 8), and after 4 months, all gonadectomized fish still showed healthy phenotype, 270 E2 and 11-KT blood concentrations measured with ELISA following the 272 manufacturers instructions revealed that E2 levels in OVX females (0,36  0,2 ng/ml) are 273 significantly lower than in sham-operated females (4,15  0,5 ng/ml) 24 hours after 274 surgery (Figure A)
 Likewise, 11-KT concentrations in orchidectomized males (0,4  0,2 275 ng/ml) are also significantly lower than in sham-operated males (
38  
32 ng/ml) 24 276 hours after surgery (Figure B)
 There is no statistical difference in blood levels of E2 and 277 11KT in gonadectomized fish after 4 months compared to the levels of those after 24 278 In contrast to fully OVX females, partly OVX fish, where only 1/3 to 1/2 of the 280 gonad was removed, showed no difference in E2 levels (3,37  0,6 ng/ml) compared to 281 sham-operated fish (Figure A)
 However, in males there is a difference observed 282 between 11KT levels of sham-operated fish and partly orchidectomized fish (
37  
92 283 ng/ml) (Figure B)
 However, partly orchidectomized males, where only 1/3 to 1/2 of the 284 gonad was removed, showed significantly higher levels of 11KT compared to in fully 285 As reported in previous literature, gonadectomy and blood sampling have long 289 been used in other model species to investigate questions related to the role of sex 290 steroids in regulation of the BPG axis
 However, these techniques seem to be amenable 291 only for bigger animals
 Considering the small size of the most used teleost models, we 292 hereby describe detailed protocols for gonadectomy and blood sampling that are feasible 293 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
 It is made The copyright holder for this this version posted August 31, 
 ;    The fact that the survival rate of gonadectomized fish reached almost 100% 295 indicates that the gonadectomy procedure is feasible to be applied on small fish
 296 Similarly, the procedure of blood sampling does not affect the survivability of the fish as 297 shown by the 100% survival after undergoing this procedure
 In addition, sham-operated 298 females reared together with sham-operated males show oviposition and 100% fertilized 299 eggs, indicating that the incision and suture procedure do not affect the reproduction of 300 the fish
 In other words, they were healthy enough to spawn
 Meanwhile, as shown in 301 Figure 7, the incision and suture mark on the fish completely disappeared 4 weeks post-302 gonadectomy and the fish are still alive and look healthy 4 months after surgery, 303 indicating that the operation procedure is safe for the fish for long term purpose 304 gonadectomy and does not affect the life span of the fish
 In addition, after 4 months no 305 gonads are observed
 This is confirmed by the low levels of E2 and 11KT which are still 306 similar to that of those found in gonadectomized fish after 24 hours
 307 Partly gonadectomized fish showed comparable concentrations of sex steroids to 308 sham-operated fish, and as a consequence, resulted in oviposition in the females and 309 fertilization of eggs
 These results suggest that the procedure of gonadectomy should be 310 performed with high precision, meaning that the ovary or testes should be completely 311 removed
 Furthermore, since this procedure does not rely on Fish Anesthesia Delivery 312 as possible to prevent mortality during surgery
 Indeed, the use of FADS enables us to 314 maintain the rhythm of operation since this tool allows continuous anesthetic condition 315 to the fish despite being exposed to the air
 Nonetheless, due to its lower feasibility in 316 smaller teleosts, the use of FADS cannot be performed with these sized fish
 Many factors 317 can affect the success rate of the procedure, including anesthesia period, the wideness of 318 incision, the accuracy and tidiness of the suture and fish handling during the procedure
 319 Since the protocol relies so much on the quick and clean procedure, some training is 320 highly recommended until reaching high success rate, indicated by high survival rate of 321 the fish after gonadectomy as well as complete removal of the gonads (see the difference 322 of morphological and anatomical appearance of the fish before and after successful 323 gonadectomy in Figure )
 Another important point is that one should prepare healthy 324 fish by maintaining the fish optimally prior to performing the protocol

 ;    With respect to blood sampling procedure, the steroid extraction is generally 326 performed using diethyl ether or dichloromethane
 Meanwhile, the evaluation of sex 327 steroid concentrations is commonly carried out by using Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent 328 Assay (ELISA) kit, and there have been many ELISA kits commercially available for 329 different types of sex steroids
 Due to the low amount of blood collected during blood 330 sampling, the assays performed to evaluate sex steroid concentrations in small teleosts is 331 not aimed for serum, but whole blood
 This might influence the results obtained from the 332 blood can slightly differ from that of serum
 Therefore, the comparison between plasma 334 and blood concentrations of sex steroids should be investigated for each assay in order to 335 determine whether measured concentrations from the assay should be re-calculated to 336 As documented in previous studies with different animal models, the protocol 338 described here will allow us to investigate questions related to reproductive physiology 339 using small teleosts as model
 In fact, these techniques have already contributed to 340 answer questions concerning the regulation of the BPG axis and its feedback 341 mechanisms, such as the involvement of kiss1 (kisspeptin gene type 1) expressing 342 neurons in nucleus ventralis tuberis (NVT), and kiss2 (kisspeptin gene type 2) expressing 344 hormone beta sub-unit gene) in esr2a (estrogen receptor gene) knock out (KO) fish well as the profile of circadian rhythm of E2 in female fish studies demonstrated that sex steroids also affect the proliferation of gonadotropic cells 348 , it would be intriguing to investigate the effects of sex 349 steroid clearance after gonadectomy on pituitary plasticity
 Besides, due to the fact that 350 the protocol can also be applied for blood glucose measurements as demonstrated in 351 , it may also be expanded to address research questions in 352 Finally, the protocols described here are intended and optimized for adult 354 medaka, and the outcomes due to different size of fish and materials used during the 355 procedures may vary
 Also, as medaka left and right ovaries/ testes are fused, which 356 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    might provide an important advantage for gonadectomy, this protocol might need few 357 small adaptations before to be used in other species where this is not the case such as in 358 zebrafish
 Thus, an optimization according to the choice of laboratory equipment and fish 359 size should be taken into account before testing these protocols
