 ;    Abnormalities of lipid/lipoprotein and glucose metabolism are hallmarks of hepatic insulin 34 resistance in type 2 diabetes
 The former antedate the latter, but the latter become progressively 35 refractory to treatment and contribute to therapeutic failures
 Its unclear whether the two processes 36 share a common pathogenesis and what underlies their progressive nature
 In this study, we 37 investigated the hypothesis that genes in the lipid/lipoprotein pathway and those in the glucose 38 metabolic pathway are governed by different transcriptional logics that affect their response to 39 physiologic (fasting/refeeding) as well as pathophysiologic cues (insulin resistance and 40 hyperglycemia)
 To this end, we obtained genomic and transcriptomic maps of the key insulin-41 regulated transcription factor, FoxO1, and integrated them with those of CREB, PPARa, and 42 glucocorticoid receptor
 We found an enrichment of glucose metabolic genes among those 43 regulated by intergenic and promoter enhancers in a fasting-dependent manner, while lipid genes 44 introns
 Glucose genes also showed a remarkable transcriptional resiliency, i
 e
, an enrichment of 46 active marks at shared PPAR/FoxO1 regulatory elements when FoxO1 was inactivated
 47 Surprisingly, the main features associated with insulin resistance and hyperglycemia were a 48 spreading of FoxO1 binding to enhancers, and the emergence of target sites unique to this 49 condition
 We surmise that this unusual pattern correlates with the progressively intractable nature 50 of hepatic insulin resistance
 This transcriptional logic provides an integrated model to interpret 51 the combined lipid and glucose abnormalities of type 2 diabetes

 These factors predispose to micro- and macrovascular complications
 The underlying 58 pathophysiology is not well understood, and mechanistic insight into it may provide better tools 59 to prevent, treat, and reverse the disease
 Here we propose an alternative explanation for this 60 pathophysiologic conundrum by illustrating a transcriptional logic underlying the regulation of 61 different classes of genes
 These findings can be interpreted to provide an integrated stepwise 62 model for the coexistence of lipid and glucose abnormalities in hepatic insulin resistance

 ;    An impairment of the physiologic response to insulin, or insulin resistance, remains the central 66 cause of type 2 diabetes together with declining insulin secretory capacity, and its principal 67 unmet treatment need ()
 The pleiotropic nature of insulin resistance poses a therapeutic 68 challenge by having different effects on different organs, and different biological consequences 69 within the same cell type, not to mention evidence of genetic heterogeneity ()
 Nowhere is this 70 challenge more apparent than at the liver, a central organ in the pathogenesis of two key 71 abnormalities in diabetes: increased production of atherogenic lipoproteins that increase the 72 diabetics susceptibility to heart disease (1); and increased glucose production, predisposing to 73 microvascular complications ()
 In addition, the progressive nature of the latter defect (4), 74 together with declining b-cell function (5), likely underlies the therapeutic failure of antidiabetic 75 drugs ()
 Among drugs directly targeting hepatic glucose production, the diabetic pharmacopeia 76 Understanding whether the two central defects of hepatic insulin resistance harken back 78 to a shared mechanism, or arise independently, has obvious implications for the discovery of new 79 treatments ()
 A useful conceptualization that has gained some consensus separates insulin 80 signaling into FoxO1-dependent and Srebp1c-dependent branches, the former emanating from 81 activation of Akt and allied kinases to regulate glucose metabolism, and the latter being relayed 82 through mTOR to supervise lipid synthetic and turnover pathways ()
 However, while the case 83 for FoxO1 regulation of specific genes is strong, its genome-wide regulatory function in the 84 broader context of the nutrient response has only been marginally addressed (9, )

 During fasting, as glucagon, catecholamine, and 88 FFA levels rise, a host of factors is activated to modulate glucose and lipid mobilization
 Besides 89 FoxO, they include CREB, PPARs, CEBPs, and nuclear receptors ()
 To address these 90 questions, we undertook to generate a liver FoxO1 cistrome in different physiologic and 91 pathophysiologic states and compare it with the CREB, PPARa, and glucocorticoid receptor 92 cistromes

 ;    There is a dearth of primary data on the kinetics of hepatic FoxO1 localization in response to 100 hormones and nutrients in the living organism
 To optimize conditions for genome-wide ChIP-101 seq, we performed immunohistochemistry in wild-type mice to determine the time- and dose-102 dependence of FoxO1 nucleocytoplasmic translocation in response to insulin
 Insulin injection 103 into the inferior vena cava triggered rapid FoxO1 translocation that reached a plateau by 15 104 minutes (Fig
 S1a), with an ED50 of 
02U/kg (plasma level 
4 ng/mL) (Fig
 Sb)
 In contrast, 105 HNF4A remained nuclear throughout (Fig
 Sa)
 Thus, FoxO1 translocation is rapid and 106 Next, we investigated translocation in response to fasting and refeeding
 Following a 108 physiologic 4-hr fast, 1-hr refeeding induced complete FoxO1 translocation (Fig
 a)
 In contrast, 109 a prolonged, 16-hr fast resulted in decreased FoxO1 immunoreactivity
 Subsequent refeeding for 110 up to 4 hr failed to translocate residual FoxO1 to the cytoplasm, while FoxO1 immunoreactivity 111 increased and HNF4A immunoreactivity decreased after 2hr refeeding (Fig
 Sc)
 The reduced 112 protein levels and delayed translocation are likely secondary to FoxO1 deacetylation (-)
 113 FoxO1 localization correlated with plasma glucose and insulin levels, as well as liver Akt 114 phosphorylation
 Thus, rapid nuclear exclusion in the 4-hr-fast/1-hr-refeed design was associated 115 with a modest rise of glucose and insulin levels (Fig
 S1d) and increased Akt phosphorylation 116 (Fig
 S1e), whereas persistent nuclear localization in the 16-hr fast/4-hr refeed design was 117 associated with hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia (Fig
 S1d), and reduced Akt phosphorylation 118 (Fig
 Se)

 ;    To study the genome-wide regulation of FoxO1 with fasting and refeeding, we interrogated 123 genome occupancy by FoxO1 using an anti-GFP antibody in FoxO1-Venus knock-in mice (12) 124 for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), to overcome the limitations of anti-FoxO1 125 antibodies
 As reported (12), anti-FoxO1 antibodies detected the FoxO1-Venus fusion protein 126 encoded by the modified Foxo1 locus (Fig
 Sa-b)
 Comparison between the two antibodies at 127 known FoxO1 target genes (Igfbp1, G6pc, and Pck1) confirmed the specificity and superior 128 sensitivity of the GFP antibody (Fig
 S2c) ()
 We next compared ChIP-qPCR and ChIP-seq 129 using GFP antibody in FoxO1Venus mice in the same conditions (Fig
 Sdh)
 Both approaches 130 demonstrated similar decreases of FoxO1 binding to Igfbp1, G6pc, and Pck1, and the lack of 131 effects on the unrelated Fkbp
 As the results were internally consistent, we performed further 132 Genome-wide FoxO1 ChIP peak calling detected ~15,000 peaks; ~8,000 unique peaks in 134 fasting, ~1,000 in refeeding, and 5,000 in both conditions but to different extents (Fig
 b)
 >30% 135 of FoxO1 sites localized to promoters/transcription start sites (TSS) (Fig

 Signal intensity 136 plots demonstrated that refeeding cleared FoxO1 binding to autosomes (Fig

 This motif was found in 17% and 139

 ;    Next, we integrated ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data into a hepatic FoxO1 regulome
 To 143 identify FoxO1-regulated mRNAs, we induced somatic ablation of FoxO1 in liver by injecting 144 Foxo1lox/lox mice with AAV-Cre (A-FLKO) and documented its completeness and specificity by 145 mRNA measurements and western blotting of different tissues (Fig
 Sf-g)
 After 3 weeks, we 146 isolated livers from 4-hr-fasted A-FLKO and control (A-WT) mice and performed RNA-seq
 We 147 plotted the log2 difference in DNA binding (FoxO1 ChIP-seq peak number in fasted vs
 refed 148 animals) vs
 the log2 difference in gene expression between A-WT and A-FLKO mice 149 (differentially expressed genes, DEGs)
 Thus, the effect of genotype lies along the vertical axis, 150 and that of fasting along the horizontal axis (Fig
 1f and Table S)
  151 Contingency analyses showed the strongest association between DEGs in the fasted state 152 and FoxO1 DNA binding sites at promoters/TSS (183 of 198, or 
4%), followed by introns 153 (260 of 344, 
6%), and intergenic sites (181 of 281, 
4%), respectively (p < 
 )
 Since 154 DEGs are more likely to be FoxO1 targets, these data provide initial, suggestive evidence of a 155 FoxO1 transcriptional logic, i
 e
, genes regulated by FoxO1 in a fasting/refeeding-dependent 156 manner have a greater frequency of FoxO1 sites in their promoter/TSS, introns, and intergenic 157 In addition to metabolism, FoxO1 regulates cellular maintenance functions in a fasting-161 independent manner ()
 We sought to understand the transcriptional logic of these diverging 162 functions
 We hypothesized that basic cellular functions would be regulated through core 163 promoters, which are generally found within 1 kb from TSS and are associated with 164 housekeeping genes and developmental TFs ()
 Conversely, we surmised that metabolic genes 165 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    would be regulated through tissue-specific enhancers (11, )
 To test the hypothesis, we mapped 166 active enhancers using H3K27ac and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq (21) in fasting and refeeding, and 167 Of 5,303 active enhancers co-localizing with FoxO1 sites genome-wide, 2,975 were 169 unique to fasting, 1,022 to refeeding, and 1,306 were found in both conditions (Fig
 Sb)
 FoxO1 170 enhancers localized mostly to intergenic regions and introns, and to a lesser extent to 171 promoter/TSS (Fig
 a)
 The rate of clearance in response to refeeding varied according to 172 genomic annotation: 
6% in intergenic regions (804/1348); 
9% in introns, (1085/1597); and 173 Next, we performed ontology analyses of genes associated with FoxO1 sites in active 175 enhancers vs
 core promoters and visualized causal relationships among enriched terms in 176 directed acyclic graphs (DAG) ()
 FoxO1 sites in active enhancers were overwhelmingly 177 enriched in metabolic genes, with the top three fundamental ontologies being glucose 178 metabolism, lipid homeostasis, and insulin response (FDR 10-40 to -70) (Fig
 2b, c, Sc)
 These 179 gene ontologies showed a strong correlation between the fasting/refeeding ratio of FoxO1 DNA 180 binding (Fig
 2d, e and S5d) (b = 
09, p < 
0001), and changes to mRNA expression following 181 FoxO1 ablation, especially in fasting conditions (Fig
 f)
 In contrast, enhancer-less FoxO1 sites 182 in promoter/TSS included gene ontologies related to intracellular transport, DNA repair, ncRNA 183 processing, and protein modification by small protein conjugation (Fig
 2g, h, S5e) (FDR 10-20 to 184 -)
 These sites showed a lesser correlation between the fasting/refeeding ratio of FoxO1 binding 185 (Fig
 2i-j and S5f) (b = 
29, p < 
 )
 More importantly, mRNAs encoded by genes lacking 186 active enhancers were largely unaffected by FoxO1 ablation (Fig
 k)
 The active enhancer 187 marker, H3K27ac, was unaffected by fasting and refeeding (b =

 ;    These results indicate that the cell maintenance and metabolic functions of FoxO1 are 189 ruled by distinct transcriptional logics: the former are governed by core promoters in a 190 fasting/refeeding-independent manner, whereas the latter are governed by active enhancers and 191 Enrichment of FoxO1 sites in introns of triglyceride and cholesterol genes 194 The second most common genomic annotation of FoxO1 binding sites mapped to introns (Fig
 195 c)
 The corresponding genes showed changes to their mRNAs following FoxO1 ablation (Fig
 196 1f and Table S)
 To understand the functional correlates of FoxO1 binding to introns, we 197 compared expected and actual distribution of FoxO1 sites across the genome for different gene 198 ontology groups
 Interestingly, triglyceride metabolism genes showed a skewed distribution, 199 with FoxO1 binding sites occurring at two- to three-fold the expected frequency at two locations: 200 5 to 50kb and 50 to 5kb from TSS (proximal introns and distal promoters), and 30 to 50% of 201 the expected frequency at 0 to 5kb and 50 to 500kb from TSS (Fig
 a)
 In contrast, glucose 202 metabolism genes showed an enrichment 50 to 500kb from TSS, followed by the 5 to 50kb 203 regions (Fig
 b)
 Statistical analyses of annotation distribution demonstrated that triglyceride 204 metabolism genes were significantly enriched in introns, while glucose metabolism genes were 205 enriched in intergenic and promoter/TSS sites (p = 
03) (Fig
 c)
 206 The ontology groups of intron-enriched genes included a nearly exclusive assortment of 207 lipid, lipoproteins, and cholesterol genes (Fig
 d)
 Nearly half of intron sites were associated 208 with active enhancers (Fig
 a)
 Next, we analyzed the FoxO1 regulome by intron enhancer 209 status
 Linear regression analysis of FoxO1 tags in the fasted vs
 refed state demonstrated that 210 introns marked by active enhancers showed a three-fold lower coefficient of variation than 211 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 S6ab), and were more frequently associated with 212 variations of the encoded mRNAs in A-FLKO
 For example, ScarB1 (23) (Fig
 3e), Angptl4, and 213 Angptl8 (24) (Table S2) showed fasting-induced FoxO1 binding to active intron enhancers, as 214 well as altered mRNA levels upon FoxO1 ablation
 In contrast, the ApoB, ApoA1/C3/A4/A5 and 215 C2/C4/C1/E clusters (the latter syntenic with the human APOCII enhancer) (25) showed fasting-216 independent FoxO1 binding to enhancer-less introns, and preserved mRNA expression following 217 The transcriptional logic of the FoxO1 regulome emerging from the preceding analyses 219 suggests that a majority of glucose metabolism genes are governed by an intergenic/proximal 220 promoter/TSS active enhancer-logic in a fasting-inducible manner, whereas a majority of 221 triglyceride, lipoprotein, and cholesterol genes are ruled by a bipartite intron-logic: fasting-222 We hypothesized that this differential logic underlies hepatic insulin resistance
 We tested 224 the hypothesis using three different conditions: (i) resilience analysis to determine whether these 225 two regulatory modalities affect the ability of these genes to undergo compensatory changes in 226 response to variations in FoxO1 function, as a surrogate measure of insulin action (Fig
 S1); (ii) 227 comparative genomic analyses with other fasting-induced TFs to identify functional partners and 228 First, we sought to determine whether different modalities of FoxO1 regulation (intergenic and 232 promoter/TSS vs
 intron) were associated with differential compensation by other TFs that may 233 affect the pathophysiology of insulin resistance

 ;    differences between constitutive vs
 adult-onset somatic ablation of FoxO1 in liver (26-28) and 235 We generated Alb-Cre:FoxO1fl/fl mice to induce constitutive hepatic FoxO1 ablation (C-237 FLKO) and compared gene expression differences between adult-onset (A-FLKO, described in 238 Fig
 1) and constitutive (C-FLKO) knockouts according to nutritional state (fast vs
 refeed), 239 genotype (WT vs
 FoxO1 ablation), and timing of ablation (A-FLKO vs
 C-FLKO) using RNA-240 seq (Fig
 S)
 t-SNE plots showed large differences in fasted vs
 refed gene expression patterns 241 between A-FLKO and their matched controls (A-WT)
 In contrast, the differences between C-242 FLKO and C-WT were considerably blunted (Fig
 a)
 We calculated fold-change and average 243 gene expression in each WT/knockout pair to draw MA-plots of log-intensity ratios (M-values) 244 vs
 averages (A-values)
 The number of differentially regulated genes in fasted C-FLKO mice 245 decreased by 60% compared to A-FLKO (227 vs
 585), whereas it was similar in refed 246 conditions (301 vs
 243) (Fig
 4be, Table S)
 Thus, a first conclusion is that chronic 247 compensatory changes partially mask the effect of FoxO1 ablation on the fasting response
 248 Next, we determined the ontologies of genes undergoing compensatory changes as a 249 function of nutritional status (fast vs
 refeed), genotype (knockout vs
 WT), and timing-of-250 ablation (A-FLKO vs
 C-FLKO) (Fig
 f)
 We identified four ontology groups (A-D)
 Group A 251 was comprised of genes induced by fasting, and group C of genes induced by refeeding, neither 252 of which was affected by FoxO1 ablation in either A-FLKO or C-FLKO mice
 These groups 253 included cellular, immune, chemical, and stress response genes
 In contrast, group B was 254 comprised of genes affected by genotype (A-FLKO vs
 A-WT and C-FLKO vs
 C-WT), 255 regardless of the timing of ablation
 This group included primarily lipid and fatty acid 256 metabolism genes whose expression decreased with fasting in FoxO1 knockouts

 ;    enriched in genes regulated by fasting, genotype, and timing of ablation
 These genes were 258 induced by fasting in WT, but not in A-FLKO mice
 However, the differences between WT and 259 A-FLKO were virtually lost in C-FLKO mice
 This group included metabolic pathways, retinol 260 and PPAR signaling, and steroid function genes (Fig
 g)
 In contrast, only a small number of 261 genes, primarily linked to extracellular matrix-receptor interaction and protein digestion and 262 We examined group D at a more granular level to identify genes in which the effect of 264 FoxO1 ablation became less marked in C-FLKO (i
 e
, lower fold-change and higher FDR value 265 between control and KO mice in C-FLKO than those in A-FLKO)
 These genes involved 266 classical FoxO1 targets regulating insulin signaling (Irs2), gluconeogenesis (G6pc, Pck1, 267 Ppargc1a), glycolysis (Gck, Pfkfb1 and 3, Ldhd), ketogenesis (Hmgcs1), and glucose/fatty acid 268 partitioning (Pdk4) (Table S)
 Other genes undergoing compensation included 17 members of 269 the Cyp2 family and 6 members of the Cyp4 family of drug metabolizing enzymes, Angptl8, 270 Fgf21, Gdf15, Klf15, Slc13a5 (encoding INDY), Enho (encoding Adropin), Fmo3, and Asns
 271 Among genes involved in fatty acid synthesis or oxidation, apolipoproteins, and 272 cholesterol trafficking, only Vldlr and Lpin1 showed >50% compensation
 Thus, FoxO1-273 regulated glucose metabolism genes as well as several metabolically important genes undergo a 274 compensatory response following constitutive FoxO1 ablation, whereas the majority of lipid 275 Transcriptional regulation of the fasting response involves several TFs, including CREB, GR, 279 and PPARa ()

 ;    role in the transcriptional resiliency observed after FoxO1 ablation, we compared the present 281 dataset with published genome-wide ChIP-seq of these three factors (29, )
 Analyses of peak 282 distribution demonstrated that CREB peaks are enriched at promoters, while GR and PPARa are 283 enriched in introns and intergenic regions (Fig
 a)
 When overlaid with FoxO1 sites, we found 284 that co-localization of FoxO1/PPARa (Fig
 5b) prevailed at active intergenic and intron 285 enhancers, where approximately half of FoxO1 sites are shared with PPARa (Fig
 5c, e)
 In 286 (Fig
 5d, e)
 At active enhancer sites, 
2% of unique FoxO1 sites were associated with changes 288 in gene expression following FoxO1 ablation, whereas only 
4% of shared sites (FoxO1 and 289 CREB or PPARa) did (p < 
0001, Table S)
 This difference was not seen in non-active 290 enhancer sites (
09% vs
 
93%, respectively) (p = NS, Table S)
 Gene ontology analysis (Fig
 291 5f) showed that abnormal gluconeogenesis is the most significant annotation of 292 FoxO1/PPARa shared intergenic peaks (FDR = 
22  10-31), while lipid homeostasis is the most 293 Next, we asked whether co-regulation by FoxO1 and PPARa can explain the resiliency 295 of gene expression
 We plotted each FoxO1/PPARa shared peak with active enhancer marks vs
 296 changes to mRNA encoded by associated genes in A-FLKO and C-FLKO (Fig
 g-h)
 In both 297 intergenic (Fig
 5g) and intron (Fig
 5h) sites, >80% of FoxO1/PPARa co-regulated genes 298 showed a compensatory response to constitutive FoxO1 ablation (75 of 92 and 68 of 76, 299 respectively)
 In intergenic sites, we found notable resilient glucose metabolism genes, such as 300 Pck1, G6pc, Irs2, Ppargc1a and b, Ppp1r3g, Cry1, Gdf15 (31) and Klf15 (32) (Fig
 g)
 In 301 introns, we found lipid genes, such as Gdf15, and Lipc (Fig

 Thus, shared 302 FoxO1/PPARa enhancers are more likely to undergo compensation when FoxO1 is inactive

 ;    To evaluate the effects of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia on the FoxO1 regulome, we 306 subjected FoxO1-Venus mice to high fat diet (HFD) or treatment with the insulin receptor 307 antagonist, S961 ()
 Both interventions impaired refeeding-induced FoxO1 translocation (Fig
 308 6a) and caused hyperglycemia (not shown)
 However, as the effects of S961 were more marked, 309 we performed genome-wide ChIP-seq in livers of 4-hr-fasted/1-hr-refed mice treated with S961 310 Regression analysis of FoxO1 tags under fasted and refed conditions showed a two-fold 312 higher coefficient in S961-treated mice than in vehicle controls (b = 
28 vs
 
62, Fig
 6b), 313 consistent with impaired translocation (Fig
 a)
 We examined FoxO1 binding to representative 314 genes of the two main transcription logics identified above, intergenic/promoter/TSS (glucose) 315 vs
 intron (lipid) genes
 We found the emergence of novel FoxO1 binding patterns at active 316 enhancers of both classes
 Examples included intergenic/promoter enhancers of glucogenic 317 (G6pc, Pck1, Klf15) (Fig
 6cd, S8a) and glucoselipid metabolic partitioning genes (Pdk4) (Fig
 318 6e), as well as intron enhancers of lipid/cholesterol genes (ApoA1/C3/A4, Scarb1) (Fig
 6f, S8b319 c)
 These novel FoxO1 peaks were unaffected by fasting/refeeding, and included both FoxO1 320 binding motif-containing sites and sites without FoxO1 motifs
 In contrast, novel FoxO1 marks 321 at enhancer-less sites occurred less frequently
 Thus, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia bring 322 about an ectopic, dysregulated binding of FoxO1 at enhancer sites, which we term enhancer 323 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    The present study provides transcriptional logic insight into the differential regulation of glucose 328 and lipid metabolism in response to nutrient changes, and in insulin resistance
 There are 329 obviously non-transcriptional components to this pathophysiologic state that are partly cell-330 nonautonomous (34), but the present study was designed to establish genome-wide map that 331 integrates multiple TFs, including FoxO1, with the salient pathophysiologic features of hepatic 332 insulin action and resistance
 The main conclusions are: (i) the transcriptional logic of FoxO1 is 333 compatible with the bifurcating model of insulin signaling to lipid vs
 glucose metabolism (35), 334 whereby glucose metabolic genes are governed by intergenic and promoter/TSS enhancers, and 335 lipid genes by a bipartite intron logic that includes fasting-dependent intron enhancers and 336 fasting independent enhancer-less introns
 (ii) Active enhancers of glucose metabolic genes show 337 transcriptional resiliency, likely through shared PPAR/FoxO1 regulatory elements
 (iii) Insulin 338 resistance and hyperglycemia result in the spreading of FoxO1 binding to enhancers, resulting in 339 Based on these findings, we propose this model (Fig
 7): in the physiologic 341 fasting/refeeding transition, FoxO1 is cleared more efficiently from enhancer-containing sites 342 than from enhancer-less sites
 As the former are more tightly associated with glucose genes, and 343 the latter with lipid/lipoprotein genes, in the initial stages of insulin resistance glucose genes can 344 still be regulated, while regulation of lipid genes is impaired
 This differential sensitivity can 345 progression of diabetes ()
 Further work will be required to functionally interrogate different 347 classes of sites

 In the clinically overt stage of the disease, as insulin resistance increases, 352 activation of FoxO1 at ectopic (or low-affinity) enhancers leads to worsening fasting 353 hyperglycemia, and may possibly underlie therapeutic failures
 The proposed model integrates in 354 vivo pathophysiological and cell biological data with genome-wide assessments to explain a 355 clinical conundrum that has important practical implications for treatment and drug development 356 ()
 This model also addresses two criticisms leveled at the FoxO-centric view of insulin action: 357 (i) that FoxO1 sensitivity to insulin makes it an unlikely candidate as a mediator of insulin 358 resistance (37); and (ii) that transcription of candidate glucogenic genes alone does not fully 359 explain increased hepatic glucose production ()
 Indeed, the gamut of FoxO1 targets includes 360 most genes involved in insulin action, and the failure to detect abnormalities in their expression 361 following constitutive somatic ablation of FoxO1 can be explained by their resiliency
 362 To demonstrate a distinctive FoxO1 transcriptional logic, we decisively leveraged the 363 ability to examine FoxO1 targets by genome-wide ChIP-seq ()
 Previous studies have been 364 limited by the sensitivity of available FoxO1 antibodies, and have therefore detected fewer 365 FoxO1 binding sites (9, 10, )
 There is a partial dissociation between the ChIP results, 366 indicating that FoxO1 is still bound at several sites after refeeding, and the immunofluorescence 367 that shows FoxO1 nuclear exclusion
 However, ChIP is more sensitive than 368 immunohistochemistry, being based on PCR amplification, and can detect lower levels of FoxO1 369 protein
 The formation of different molecular complexes likely underlies the different modes of 370 FoxO1 action
 In this regard, we have previously shown that SIN3a is the FoxO1 corepressor at 371 glucokinase, providing a mechanistic precedent for gene-specific targeting ()

 ;    regulation of FoxO1 by fasting/refeeding at active enhancers likely results from intrinsic and 373 extrinsic factors, such as higher DNA accessibility at active enhancers (40), and active enhancer-374 promoter interactions (41) that affect assembly of pre-initiation complexes, initiation of 375 Following FoxO1 ablation, expression of its targets can be compensated for by 377 transcription factors acting synergistically, through its paralogue FoxO3, or reorganization of 378 chromatin accessibility at sites where FoxO1 acts as pioneer transcription factor (42), as shown 379 with other FoxO isoforms ()
 Interestingly, genes associated with glucose metabolism (G6pc, 380 Pck1, Ppargc1a, Pdk4 and Klf15), but not those regulating general cellular responses, are 381 selectively compensated for following FoxO1 ablation
 FoxO1 peaks in these genes are cleared 382 by refeeding, but not in insulin-resistant conditions
 These genes have been shown to play a role 383 in diabetes in studies with insulin-resistant mice (26, -)
  384 There are parallels between our findings and recent evidence that immunocyte 385 differentiation is controlled by an enhancer- or core promoter-driven logic, with a striking 386 partition between the two gene sets ()
 The former activity is cued by the overall activity 387 pattern of distal enhancers, while the latter is aligned with promoters
 Although it is disputed 388 whether core promoters and enhancers represent different entities or synergistically regulate 389 transcriptional bursting, enhancers are thought to be tissue-specific, and thus more likely to 390 confer specificity on the tissue-specific metabolic functions of FoxO1 ()
 391 interactions with GR, CREB and PPARa, the latter involving up to half of the FoxO1 sites in 393 active enhancers
 The extensive sharing of intergenic active enhancers of glucose genes by 394 FoxO1 and PPARa is a novel finding of this study that dovetails with the different physiologic 395 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    cues regulating these two TFs
 During fasting, glycogenolysis precedes gluconeogenesis and the 396 generation of FFA substrates that activate PPARa ()
 Thus, we envision that FoxO1 and 397 PPARa act in a physiologic relay to ensure continuity between the early and late fast
 The 398 significant overlap between FoxO1 and PPAR may also provide an explanation for the 399 relatively mild phenotypes of liver-specific inactivation of FoxO1 (26) and PPARa ()

 Model of FoxO1 transcriptional logic in the pathogenesis of selective insulin resistance  768 In normal conditions, FoxO1 is cleared upon refeeding from resilient enhancers, enriched in 769 glucose metabolism genes, but not in introns, enriched in lipid metabolism genes
 With the onset 770 of insulin resistance-induced hyperinsulinemia, FoxO1 can be cleared from resilient enhancers, 771 but not from introns, increasing serum lipoprotein and triglyceride levels
 As insulin resistance 772 progresses, compensation by PPAR and spreading of FoxO1 binding to additional sites bolsters 773 expression of glucose metabolic genes, inducing fasting hyperglycemia with dyslipidemia
