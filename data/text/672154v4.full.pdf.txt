 ;    Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent and debilitating, and development of improved treatments is              limited by insufficient understanding of the neurological changes associated with disease remission
 In turn,              efforts to elucidate these changes have been challenging due to disease heterogeneity as well as limited                effectiveness, delayed onset, and significant off-target effects of treatments
 We developed a form of repetitive               transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) that in an open-label study               was associated with remission from MDD in 90% of individuals in 1-5 days (Stanford Accelerated Intelligent                Neuromodulation Therapy, SAINT)
 This provides a tool to begin exploring the functional connectivity (FC)              changes associated with MDD remission
 Resting-state fMRI scans were performed before and after SAINT in               18 participants with moderate-to-severe, treatment-resistant MDD
 FC was determined between regions of            interest defined a priori by well-described roles in emotion regulation
 Following SAINT, FC was significantly               decreased between subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC) and 3 of 4 default mode network (DMN) nodes
               Significant reductions in FC were also observed between the following: DLPFC-striatum, DLPFC-amygdala,            larger decreases in FC between DLPFC-amygdala and DLPFC-insula, as well as smaller decreases in FC               between sgACC-DMN
 Greater clinical improvements were correlated with lower baseline FC between            DMN-DLPFC, DMN-striatum, and DMN-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
 The multiple, significant reductions in           FC we observed following SAINT and remission from depression support the hypothesis that MDD is a state of                  hyper-connectivity within these networks, and rapid decoupling of network nodes may lead to rapid remission               certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    Major depressive disorder is common and debilitating
 It has been difficult to study the brain changes                associated with recovery from depression, because treatments take weeks-to-months to become effective, and             symptoms fail to resolve in many people
 We recently developed a type of magnetic brain stimulation called                 SAINT
 SAINT leads to full remission from depression in 90% of people within 5 days
 We used SAINT and                   functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine how the brain changes with rapid remission from              depression
 We found changes in areas of the brain associated with emotion regulation

 ;    Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide (1, 2) and is increasingly common                 with a lifetime prevalence in the United States of more than 20% ()
 Combating this endemic disease will                  require improvements in prophylaxis and treatments; however, the development of both is limited in part by                Investigating the network-level changes associated with remission from MDD has been particularly            challenging due to disease heterogeneity of MDD (4, 5), as well as antidepressant medications requiring               weeks-to-months to induce remission (6) with limited efficacy (7, )
 Conventional repetitive transcranial             magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used to investigate functional connectivity changes that occur with              remission (9); however, conventional rTMS also requires several weeks to induce remission with less than half                of patients remitting ()
 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has greater efficacy and more rapid onset of action                than antidepressant medications; however, mean onset is still >2 weeks (11), open-label remission rates occur               in only 50-65% of patients (7), and there are numerous significant off-target effects, including cognitive               disturbances (12) and effects on the motor system (13), making it difficult to determine which network changes                 are specific to remission from depression
 Ketamine induces brief remission rapidly but only in a third of                 patients (14, 15) and with significant off-target effects (16, )
 Incipient investigations of potent 5-HT2a               agonists demonstrate high rates of rapid remission (18, 19); yet, the off-target effects are profound ()
 We                 recently developed a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) that was associated with              remission in 90% of individuals (n=21) with moderate-to-severe, treatment-resistant MDD in a mean of ~3 days                without off-target effects in an open-label study (21, )
 This treatment provides a new opportunity to                We chose to begin our investigation at the network level with a resting-state functional connectivity (FC)                analysis, because neuroimaging-based approaches that assess resting-state FC have demonstrated some           success in investigating neurocircuit-level dysfunction of MDD
 These approaches have been used to             investigate neurophysiological subtypes of MDD (4, 5) and predict treatment efficacy of rTMS (23, 24, 4,                )
 Given the promise of this approach, we performed resting state FC analyses on participants before                and after SAINT
 For this initial investigation, we restricted our analysis to brain regions involved in emotion                 Several lines of evidence suggest dysfunction of emotion regulation in MDD (31) with neural correlates               observed with fMRI (32, )
 The neural basis of emotion regulation includes emotional reactivity: amygdala               and striatum; explicit control of emotion  central executive network (CEN): dorsolateral prefrontal cortex              (dlPFC), ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC); and implicit emotion regulation  default mode network (DMN), salience              certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    affective network (SN) and insula
 For review, see Etkin et al ()
 Specifically, dysfunction within the DMN,                 CEN, and SN has repeatedly been reported in individuals with MDD ()
 Numerous fMRI studies have                demonstrated that individuals with MDD have altered frontal connectivity with amygdala (4044) and striatum              (23, 4547); hyperconnectivity between DMN and amygdala (4851); and alterations in insular connectivity             Following the emotional dysregulation hypothesis of depression, stimulation of the CEN at the lDLPFC              node, via rTMS (37, 54, 55) and transcranial direct current stimulation (56), has been hypothesized to produce                 antidepressant effects by enhanced regulation of emotion
 This is in line with Chen et als seminal interleaved                 TMS/fMRI study demonstrating causal interactions between CEN and DMN, such that increased activity in              CEN results in suppression of DMN (57), and this has led others to hypothesize that improved accuracy of                  targeting these networks might produce better treatment efficacy (2729, 5860), as only a third or less of                 participants remit from their depressive episode with rTMS stimulation of the lDLPFC, a CEN node ()
                We hypothesized that individualized targeting and enhanced stimulation techniques could improve outcomes            (22), and we developed Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT)
 In our initial             open-label trial of SAINT in patients (n=21) with moderate-to-severe, treatment-resistant depression, we            observed a strikingly high remission rate of 90% with a mean of ~3 days of treatment to produce remision ()
                    Thus, FC changes that occur following SAINT may reflect generalized network-level changes associated with              remission from depression
 Herein, we report our first investigation of the resting-state FC changes that occur                Eighteen participants [9 males, mean age 
 
6 (meanSD)] were recruited for the study and              received viable MRI scans before and after SAINT
 Participants had a diagnosis of MDD with a mean Hamilton                  Depression Rating Scale 17-item (HAMD-17) score of

5 augmentation medications

 Stimulation location was depth-corrected (64) and chosen               based on an algorithm that selected the area within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) with the                 most negative FC with sgACC ()

 All linear regressions between baseline FC and changes in MADRS are reported in Supplementary                The development of SAINT has provided us with a unique opportunity to assess the FC changes that                 occur during rapid remission from moderate-to-severe, treatment-resistant MDD
 The analysis we undertook in             this initial report focused on brain regions associated with emotion regulation, and we found that FC                significantly decreases between several of these regions following remission from MDD, with the magnitude of               FC change often correlating with symptom improvement
 Moreover, we found pre-treatment connectivity            between several regions to be predictive of the magnitude of this improvement
  Notably, we observed a significant reduction in mean sgACC-DMN connectivity after SAINT, and this              reduction was present between sgACC and 3 of 4 DMN nodes, with a nearly significant trend in the remaining                   certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 In previous studies of depression, hyper-activity/connectivity within DMN has been considered as             evidence of dysfunction of rumination and self-referential processing, and antidepressant treatment is            hypothesized to normalize DMN activity and connectivity (24, 37, )
 Our results support this hypothesis               and raise another important question: Does the magnitude of overall suppression of DMN FC track with                antidepressant treatment efficacy? Prior studies have reported significant reductions in FC between sgACC             and 1 to 2 nodes of DMN (24, 37, 6567); whereas, we observed significant reduction in FC in nearly all DMN                     nodes
 Bearing in mind that open-label SAINT was associated with remission in 90% of participants in 1-5 days                  Moreover, this hypothesis builds on some of the earliest neuroimaging studies in the field of psychiatry,                which reported increased sgACC activity in patients during depressive episodes ()
 This has been              hypothesized to be causally related to reductions in lDLPFC activity (69) and reinforced by observations that                antidepressant treatments lead to reductions in sgACC activity ()
 For review, see Hamani et al ()
                Early investigators concomitantly reported observations of hypometabolism and hypoperfusion in the lDLPFC            of patients with MDD ()
 Later investigators demonstrated that lDLPFC activity is restored with treatment               of MDD (70, 71, 8287), and this early data prompted investigators to begin hypothesizing a major role of                  This led to the conception of depression as dysregulation in corticolimbic systems ()
 In recent years,                this concept has continued to evolve to include neural networks and their interactions
 Several groups have                reported evidence that depression is associated with increased FC between sgACC and DMN (35, 36, 53,                9094), and others have shown that stimulation of lDLPFC potentiates upstream neural circuits to normalize               sgACC-DMN connectivity (24, 37, )
 This does not seem to be limited to individuals with depression, as                 rTMS of lDLPFC also has been shown to improve mood and reduce connectivity between sgACC and DMN in                  never-depressed participants ()
 Thus, we hypothesize that the significant reduction in FC in nearly all DMN                nodes that we observed in SAINT may reflect the normalization of DMN hyper-connectivity associated              Interestingly, at the group level, FC between sgACC and DMN significantly decreased following SAINT              in our cohort; however, individual changes in FC magnitude showed that participants with increased FC               between sgACC and DMN actually had the greatest clinical improvement
 One interpretation is that              normalization of FC between sgACC and DMN is more complex than magnitude of FC change between 2                 nodes
 Alternately, disease heterogeneity may be related to changes in FC that are challenging to predict at                 the individual level with current approaches
 Others have reported the opposite direction of association with the                largest improvements in depression being associated with the largest reductions in FC between sgACC and               mDMN (67); however, their patient cohort had comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder, which may respond              certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    differently to rTMS of the lDLPFC ()
 Further, both Philip et al (67) and our current report found an overall                    reduction in mean FC between sgACC and DMN in participants with improved depressive symptoms
 This               possible discrepancy could also be due to the limited variability in post-treatment MADRS scores in our                sample
 Also, we do not know how FC changed throughout the treatment course
 Those who responded the earliest generally had larger reductions in MADRS scores; thus, there could                be a staged, non-monotonic change in FC whereby FC initially decreases until symptoms remit and then                increases with continued treatment
 A similar non-monotonic time course has been reported for psilocybin,              whereby acute administration decouples sgACC from DMN (97), but this connectivity increases from baseline              in the days following treatment ()
 Thus, additional studies will be crucial to determine the validity, reliability,                 Our assessment of the association between baseline FC and clinical improvements in depression             scores also revealed a central role of the DMN
 Greater clinical improvements were associated with lower                baseline FC between DMN and DLPFC, striatum, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
 Although FC between              DLPFC and DMN predicts efficacy of ECT (98), other studies with similar findings could not be located with                  extensive database searching
 Past studies that have utilized FC to predict response have found that FC                between stimulation site lDLPFC and striatum predicts TMS (23, 25), and several groups have reported that                FC between stimulation site and sgACC that is more negative results in greater reductions in depressive                symptoms with rTMS (28, 29, )
 In our current study, we optimized targeting by stimulating the portion of                  lDLPFC with maximum anticorrelation with sgACC; thus, it is possible that this may underlie the striking                reductions in depression symptoms we observed
 Finally, in contrast to antidepressant medications (30), intact              baseline connectivity between DMN and ACC was not related to outcomes following SAINT
 Considering that               depressive disorders may be distinguished based on intrinsic connectivity (99), it is interesting to note that                SAINT was largely effective regardless of intrinsic connectivity, which may indicate that its mechanism of               In addition to reduced FC between sgACC and DMN, we observed several other notable changes in                FC
 Specifically, we found reductions in connectivity between DLPFC and amygdala, insula, and limbic              striatum to be associated with clinical improvement in depression
 For rDLPFC-left amygdala FC, in addition to                finding reduced positive FC, we also found that greater clinical improvement was associated with larger               decreases in FC
 Several fMRI studies have demonstrated that individuals with MDD have altered frontal               connectivity with amygdala ()
 Depressed individuals may have increased positive connectivity between            rDLPFC and left amygdala (100, 101), and individuals with depression have an impaired ability to regulate                negative emotions ()
 Considering that non-depressed individuals can better suppress amygdala activity (43,             44), our results here could represent a partial normalization of connectivity related to improved emotion               certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 baseline positive FC between rDLPFC-amygdala is pathological, a reduction in positive FC is               improved, and negative FC is normalized; however, our experimental design did not include never-depressed              participants, so this remains speculative
 Our combined findings of changes in FC with sgACC and amygdala                following DLPFC stimulation with SAINT is supported by recent work with interwoven TMS and fMRI that                Similarly, we found that greater clinical improvements were associated with larger decreases in FC              between lDLPFC and insula
 Insula has a well-known role in interoception (103, 104), and insula activity is                 correlated with abnormal interoception in MDD ()
 Insula metabolism has been linked to predicting              antidepressant treatment response, and has thus been proposed as a depression biomarker ()
 Our results               here are similar to other reports
 Theta-burst rTMS stimulation of lDLPFC has been reported to reduce the                 magnitude of FC between lDLPFC and right insula (107) with baseline FC between these structures predicting                clinical response ()
 Interestingly, individuals with subthreshold depression have lower FC between DLPFC             (laterality not specified) and left insula compared to non-depressed individuals ()
 This apparent directional              mismatch highlights the importance of determining the causality of mechanism using within-subject analyses             prior to using these findings as biomarkers to optimize treatment efficacy
  We also observed reduced FC in rDLPFC-limbic striatum following SAINT
 Increased rDLPFC-dorsal            caudate connectivity has been reported to correlate with increased depression severity (110), and FC between               rDLPFC and ventral rostral putamen has been shown to decrease following depression treatment ()
              Similarly, Furman et al found that depressed individuals have greater FC between DLPFC and dorsal caudate,                and this FC was significantly correlated with depression severity, but they did not specify laterality ()
 This                 association has also been reported for lDLPFC-ventral striatum FC
 Avissar et al reported that improvement in                depression correlated with more reduction in lDLPFC-ventral striatum FC following treatment with rTMS of              lDLPFC ()
 Thus, reducing DLPFC-striatum FC may be an important route to inducing remission from               depression
 The combined results show consistent association between significant changes in DLPFC FC with              limbic structures following SAINT, which supports the hypothesis that regulation of emotion plays a central role                This hypothesis is further supported by our observation that following SAINT we found a significant               decoupling of SN nodes, i
 e
 reduced FC between amygdala-insula, amygdala-dACC, amygdala-limbic           striatum, and between amygdala subregions
 Increased SN FC has been reported to be associated with               decreased anticipated pleasure (112) and MDD ()
 Further, other groups have reported that individuals with               MDD have greater FC between insula and amygdala (105, 114) and amygdala and striatum ()
 This                dysfunction in SN FC may underlie the biased reactivity to negative emotions observed in individuals with MDD                 certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    Some results we observed are more challenging to interpret
 For example, following SAINT, FC              significantly decreased between fDMN and multiple subregions of right amygdala and between multiple DMN              nodes and striatum
 rTMS of the lDLPFC has previously been shown to reduce FC between DMN and striatum                  in non-depressed individuals ()
 However, other reports suggest the opposite association for mDMN             (posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus): Individuals with depression have reduced FC between amygdala             and precuneus compared to non-depressed controls (116), and connectivity between amygdala and posterior             cingulate cortex is greater in less depressed individuals ()
 Our finding that FC between DMN and striatum                 decreased after SAINT is consistent with groups who have observed a similar change with antidepressant               (118) and ECT treatment ()
 Others have reported that FC between mDMN and caudate is reduced in                 depressed individuals (120), indicating this may be a compensatory mechanism; however, this is complicated              by reports that reduced FC between DMN and ventral striatum is associated with impaired reward responsivity                ()
 Thus, a causal association between these changes in FC with depression is difficult to infer at this time
  Our observations should be considered in the context of the studys weaknesses
 Foremost, the              open-label design without a sham or standard-of-care rTMS control group limits our ability to determine if FC                 changes were due to SAINT, remission from MDD, or the passage of time
 Sham-controlled, double-blinded               assessment of SAINT is currently underway to address this important question
 A strength and weakness of                our analysis is the low variability in treatment-associated changes in depressive symptoms
 Ninety percent of               individuals were in remission from MDD following SAINT, with only 2 participants not remitting in this cohort,                 linear-regression assessments demonstrated floor-effects, likely eliminating the potential to observe possible           associations between changes in FC and clinical response
 The small sample size further limited our likelihood                of observing inter-individual differences
 On the other hand, the high proportion of remitters increases our               confidence in mean changes in functional connectivities across the group
 Follow-up controlled trials will be               helpful in determining the reliability of the findings we observed here
 A limitation of our neuroimaging methods                 is that our resolution was insufficient to explore the role of the hippocampus and its sub-regions
 As the                  hippocampus has numerous reports describing an important role in depression (122), future studies of SAINT               would benefit from assessment of FC related to this important structure
 Finally, we included ROIs with multiple                 prior reports demonstrating a role in emotion regulation; however, we did not confirm that the changes in FC                  that we observed were associated with changes in emotion regulation beyond standardized depression scales
 Depression remains a major public health problem with current treatments taking weeks to months to               induce remission, and there are millions of people who are not effectively treated with current methods
                Development of improved treatments could be accelerated by a better understanding of the neural changes               that are necessary and sufficient to achieve disease remission

 ;    produces rapid and high rates of remission from MDD, provides an opportunity to begin searching for these                 neural changes
 Our initial analysis of brain regions associated with emotion regulation demonstrates MDD              remission is associated with a significant reduction in FC between sgACC and almost all major nodes of the                  DMN, bolstering prior hypotheses of the central role this network plays in MDD
 We also found that decoupling                  of SN nodes was correlated with depression improvement, highlighting the role of other networks as well
 As                 our current study is based on an open-label trial of SAINT, controlled trials will be necessary to determine                  which observed changes in FC are unique to SAINT and disease remission in order to prioritize network-level                 Detailed information regarding the participants, SAINT protocol, experimental design, and behavioral           data analysis can be found in our prior report ()
 Briefly, participants treated with SAINT had a diagnosis of                   treatment-resistant MDD and complete MRI scans both pre- and post-SAINT
 Diagnosis of MDD was              confirmed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)
 Participants were required to have a              Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item (HDRS-17) score higher than 20 and not have responded to at                least 1 antidepressant medication (minimum trial duration of 6 weeks) to be eligible for the study
 Participants                 had no history of a psychotic disorder, substance use disorder, major systemic illness, current mania               (assessed using the Young Mania Rating Scale), lesional neurological disorder, or any contraindications to              rTMS or MRI (such as implanted metal or history of seizures)
 All participants provided written informed                consent, and the study was approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board and in accordance                Participants received a 5-day treatment course under the SAINT protocol
 Stimulation location was             chosen based on an algorithm that selected the area within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) with                 the most negative FC with sgACC
 This is described in detail in our prior report ()
 A MagVenture MagPro                   X100 (MagVenture A/S, Denmark) system was used to deliver sessions of intermittent theta-burst stimulation              (iTBS): 60 cycles of 10 bursts of 3 pulses at 50Hz were delivered in 2 second trains (5Hz) with an 8 second                      inter-train interval Stimulation sessions were delivered hourly
 Ten sessions were applied per day (18,000              pulses/day) for 5 consecutive days (90,000 pulses in total)
 Stimulation was delivered at 90% resting motor                threshold (rMT)
 A depth correction (64) was applied to the resting motor threshold to adjust for differences in                  the cortical depth of the individuals functional target compared to the primary motor cortex in order to                 certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 A Localite Neuronavigation System (Localite GmbH, Sankt Augustin, Germany) was              used to position the TMS coil over the individualized stimulation target
 All participants in this reports subset                 Participants depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 item            (HAMD-17) (123) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (Montgomery and Asberg,           )
 HAMD-17 and MADRS assessments were performed 1-4 days before SAINT (baseline) and 1-4 days               after the 5-day SAINT treatment (post-treatment) in concordance with MRI scans
 All participants were screened for MRI safety prior to any scanning procedures
 MRI scans were               acquired approximately 72hrs before SAINT (baseline) and approximately 72hrs after the 5-day SAINT             treatment (post-treatment)
 Each participant underwent identical baseline and post-treatment MRI scans           consisting of structural and resting-state functional MRI acquisitions
 All MRI scans were acquired using a 3T                GE Discovery MR750 scanner with a 32-channel head-neck imaging coil at the Center for Cognitive and                were acquired for the whole brain (FOV=256x256mm; matrix=256x256 voxel; slice thickness=
9mm;           During the 8-min resting state scans, participants were instructed to keep their eyes open and their                attention focused on a central fixation point, which consisted of a black screen with a white fixation cross
                  Participants were also instructed to let their minds wander freely and to avoid any repetitive thoughts such as                  counting
 Whole-brain resting-state scans were collected with a 3X simultaneous multi-slice (i

 For this initial analysis, we restricted our ROIs to brain regions that have consistently been reported to                 play a role in MDD and emotion regulation: DLPFC, VLPFC, DMN, sgACC, SN, insula, amygdala and striatum
 In line with prior studies (26, 37, 78, 133, 134), the DLPFC (BA9, BA46), VLPFC (BA44, BA45, BA47),                  and the sgACC (BA25) were defined by Brodmann areas (BA), using the Talairach atlas ()
 The 4 nodes of                   DMN were extracted from the Multi-Subject Dictionary Learning (MSDL) atlas
 DMN nodes were labeled using               MSDL nomenclature: fDMN (Frontal DMN: medial prefrontal cortex), mDMN (median DMN: posterior cingulate             cortex and precuneus), lDMN (left DMN: left angular gyrus), rDMN (right DMN: right angular gyrus) ()
 The                 nodes of the SN, including anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and insula were                 also obtained from MSDL
 The striatum and amygdala are large nuclei with heterogeneous functions (23,               137141); hence, we constructed our ROIs of these structures by subregions
 The executive and limbic               (striatum-con-label-thr25-3sub) ()
 Amygdala and its subregions were extracted using the Julich histological            atlas: centromedian amygdala (CMA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and superficial amygdala (SA) ()
 All statistical analyses were conducted with R ()
 FC was calculated as the correlation (Pearson) of                the activity pattern across time between ROIs
 All Pearson correlation coefficients were then transformed into               Fisher's Z score for further analysis
