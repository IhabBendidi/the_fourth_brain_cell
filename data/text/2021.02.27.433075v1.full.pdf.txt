 Interstitial lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are caused by persistent micro-injuries to alveolar epithelial tissues together with aberrant repair processes
 Despite substantial advancement in our understanding of IPF progression, numerous questions remain concerning disease pathology
 IPF is currently treated with pirfenidone and nintedanib, compounds which slow the rate of disease progression but fail to treat underlying causes of disease
 The DNA repair enzyme 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1) is upregulated following TGF- exposure in several fibrosis-associated cell types
 Currently, no pharmaceutical solutions targeting OGG1 have been utilized in the treatment of IPF
 In this study, a novel small molecule OGG1 inhibitor, TH5487, decreased myofibroblast transition and associated pro-fibrotic markers in fibroblast cells
 In addition, TH5487 decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, inflammatory cell infiltration, and lung remodeling in a murine model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis
 Taken together, these data strongly suggest that TH5487 is a potent, specific, and clinically-(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disorder characterized by progressive lung scarring with a median 2 survival time of 3 years post-diagnosis ()
 The disease is associated with increasing cough and dyspnea, 3 affecting approximately 3 million people worldwide, with incidence strongly correlated with increasing age 4 ()
 IPF is defined on the histological basis of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), with UIP usually 5 presenting as honeycombing and peripheral alveolar septal thickening ()
 Fibroblast and myofibroblast 6 overactivation/overstimulation results in extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in alveolar walls, reducing 7 alveolar spaces ()
 Current IPF therapies focus on inhibiting collagen deposition by blocking myofibroblast 8 activation
 These approaches have shown limited success in achieving overall IPF resolution, highlighting 9 Injured IPF tissues produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in DNA damage and the upregulation 11 of fibrotic-related pathways, ultimately leading to lung architecture collapse (8, )
 The DNA base guanine 12 is particularly prone to oxidation, forming 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (-oxoG)
 8-oxoG bases are 13 recognized by the enzyme 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1), whereby OGG1 binding triggers DNA 14 inducing agents ()
 Furthermore, the increased expression of OGG1 is an important marker of 16 inflammation and resultant fibrotic processes (11, )
    17 Following lung injury, fibroblasts transition to myofibroblasts through stimulatory factors such as TGF-1, 18 which further induce the production of fibrotic markers including alpha smooth muscle actin (-SMA), 19 collagen, and fibronectin (13, )
 The fibroblast to myofibroblast transition and migratory activities are 20 Interestingly, siRNA-mediated Ogg1 knockdown in murine embryonic fibroblast cells revealed decreased 22 levels of tissue-associated -SMA ()
 OGG1s implication in fibrogenesis, combined with its role in 23 inflammation, highlights this enzyme as a therapeutic target for IPF treatment ()
 Thus, we hypothesize 24 that efficacy of a previously identified, potent, and selective OGG1 inhibitor (TH5487) may show promise 25 in a murine model of IPF
 In this study, we used a 21-day intratracheally bleomycin-challenged murine 26 model to confirm TH5487 efficacy in vivo
 This model reproduces several phenotypic features of human 27 IPF, including peripheral alveolar septal thickening and acute cytokine production resolving in fibrosis (19, 28 Murine C57BL/6 embryonic lung fibroblasts (MEFs; ATCC, Manassa, VA) and HFL-1 cells were cultured 33 in complete growth medium supplemented with L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL 34 streptomycin, and 10% FBS

 ;    assay showed the wound area percentage in all cell types was significantly reduced following TGF-1 162 addition, indicating the expected pro-migratory effects of TGF-B1 stimulation (Figure A)
 TGF-B1-163 induced wound closure was inhibited by TH5487 treatment across all tested cell lines (Figure A)
 164 Interestingly, dexamethasone only inhibited cell migration in BEAS 2B and HFL-1 cells and showed 165 minimal effects in A549 and mouse lung fibroblast cells
 In summary, these results indicate TH5487 is 166 capable of inhibiting TGF-B1-mediated migratory effects of lung-derived cells, including both human- and 167 TGF-1 driven fibrosis results in the transition of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts resulting in the production 171 of fibrotic proteins
 TH5487 treatment additionally reduced the production of collagen, fibronectin, and -172 smooth muscle actin, as measured by immunofluorescence and qPCR (Figure 1B and E)
 Compelling 173 evidence of TH5487 involvement in OGG1 reduction is presented in Figure 1C, with significant decrease 174 in OGG1 fluorescence compared to TGF-
 To investigate myofibroblast transition, TGF-B1-stimulated 175 HFL-1 cells were analyzed for TH5487-mediated inhibition to myofibroblasts in a transwell assay (Figure 176 D)
 Interestingly, TH5487 significantly reduced this myofibroblast transition (P <

 Mice received a one-off intratracheal administration of bleomycin (
5 U/kg) and were dosed (IP) 182 with TH5487 or dexamethasone 1h post-bleomycin administration, followed by additional dosing once per 183 day, in five-day intervals, over a total period of 21 days (Figure A)
 Body weights were recorded as a 184 proxy for murine health status (Figure B)
 Mice in the bleomycin/vehicle group lost 
5  
1 % total 185 bodyweight, whilst mice in remaining groups either maintained their bodyweight or gained significant 186 weight compared to the bleomycin/vehicle group over the experiment timeline

 Figure -)
 Cytokines were assessed in lung tissue homogenate, 191 BALF, and plasma (Figure 3 A-C)
 TH5487 treatment significantly reduced the levels of several bleomycin-192 induced inflammatory cytokines, including those in the BALF such as IL-9, eotaxin, MIP-1 (*P<
05), 193 MIP-1 and IL-5 (**P<
01), and KC (***P<

 Decreases in neutrophil count 206 and inflammatory macrophages were seen following TH5487 administration compared to 207 vehicle/bleomycin samples (Figure 4A and B)
 Giemsa-Wright-stained BALF samples showed bleomycin-208 treated macrophages were enlarged, displaying an inflammatory phenotype not seen in mice treated with 209 Next, TH5487s impact on bleomycin-induced lung damage was investigated using histological analysis of 213 whole lung sections obtained from the in vivo studies (Supp
 Figure 4 and )
 Bleomycin-treated control 214 mice displayed significant lung damage when compared to saline-treated controls (Figure 5A and B)
 215 Bleomycin-treated mice that received TH5487 treatment showed reduced lung damage, with lesser degrees 216 of alveolar structural collapse, less septal thickening of the alveoli, and less immune cell influx as indicated 217 by the H&E stain (Figure A)
 Picrosirius red staining revealed a reduced level of collagen deposition in 218 TH5487-treated versus control-treated mice (Figure B)
 Positive pixel analysis was used to quantify lung 219 damage and showed significantly less H&E and picrosirius red staining in the TH 5487-administered lungs, 220 with no significant decreases in either staining reported for dexamethasone-treated lungs (Figure 5A and 221 B)
 Further, scanning electron microscopy analysis (SEM) revealed collagen deposition surrounding the 222 alveolar walls of bleomycin control mice was reduced in response to TH5487 treatment (Figure C)
 223 Immunofluorescent staining of murine lung sections revealed decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO), 224 fibronectin, COL1A1, and OGG1 staining compared to the vehicle bleomycin control group (Figure D)
 225 To further support the involvement of OGG1 in fibrotic related lung damage, co-staining was carried out 226 on murine lung sections, revealing increased COL1A1/OGG1 fluorescence in similar lung areas (Figure 227 IPF is an interstitial lung disease characterized by dysregulated inflammation, progressive lung scarring, 231 and eventual death due to respiratory complications (1, )
 Importantly, uncontrolled lung injury is a 232 hallmark of IPF initiation and progression, resulting in pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokine release 233 driving further fibrosis-related immune cell influx and ECM remodeling (16, 22, )
 Ensuing TGF- 234 production following lung injury results in the upregulation of tissue repair genes, including the DNA base 235 excision repair gene OGG1 (14, 24, )
 Previously reported data indicate that OGG1 is increased in lung 236 epithelial cells and fibroblasts following TGF- stimulation addition ()
  237 Although studies showing in vitro and in vivo involvement of OGG1 in various pathologies, this is to the 238 best of our knowledge, the first reported evidence of OGG1-targeting using a clinically relevant 239 pharmacological agent
 The approach reported in this study utilizes a potent and selective small molecule 240 employing a novel and distinct mechanism of action, preventing OGG1 from binding damaged DNA, 241 initiating transcription factors, and upregulating pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways ()

 ;    A549, BEAS 2B, HFL-1, and murine lung fibroblast cells were included in wound healing assays
 TH5487 245 significantly reduced migration and wound healing compared to TGF- controls in all tested cell types
 In 246 addition, myofibroblast transition is vital to ECM remodeling, leading to lung tissue rigidity and decreased 247 breathing capacity ()
 In this regard, HFL-1 myofibroblast transition and proliferation was significantly 248 Whilst increased myofibroblast number has been directly linked with IPF progression, fibrotic markers such 250 as collagen, fibronectin, and -SMA have additionally been linked with ECM deposition and IPF 251 progression (30, )
 In this study, we show that collagen, fibronectin, and -SMA are reduced by TH5487 252 treatment in murine lung fibroblast cells stimulated with TGF-, whilst dexamethasone reduced collagen 253 and -SMA but importantly did not decrease fibronectin
 Fibronectin is a crucial ECM glycoprotein 254 abundantly expressed by fibroblasts, mediating migration and proliferation of myofibroblasts ()
 255 Transition of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts is additionally associated with transcriptional upregulation of 256 profibrotic genes
 The effects of TH5487 on transcription of -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and collagen 257 (ColA1) in TGF-1 stimulated HFL-1 cells were investigated by qPCR
 TH5487, 10 M significantly 258 reduced transcription of Col1A1 and -SMA while TH5487 at 5 M reduced mRNA levels of -SMA in 259 TGF-1 stimulated cells
 Furthermore, immunofluorescence revealed a significant and specific decrease in 260 OGG1 expression following TH5487 treatment, a decrease not seen in TGF- or dexamethasone controls
 261 Importantly, this confirms the potent and specific activity of TH5487 to decrease OGG1 in fibrosis-inducing 262 In this study, in vivo efficacy of TH5487 was tested using an intratracheal bleomycin model of fibrotic lung 264 damage
 Bleomycin-induced fibrosis in C57BL/6 mice is reproducible, only affects the lungs, and is widely 265 used, allowing generation of comparative results (20, )
 Previous studies have shown significant fibrotic-266 associated weight loss in this model (34), an effect confirmed in this study
 Murine weight-loss was 267 significantly higher in groups not receiving TH5487 or dexamethasone, indicative of the protective effects 268 Mechanistic studies using this model, incorporated pro-inflammatory cytokine measurement of various 270 lung environments
 BALF, plasma, and lung homogenate displayed significantly decreased levels of a pro-271 inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines
 Specifically, macrophage-recruiting cytokines such as MIP-1 272 were significantly reduced in the BALF and lung homogenate samples, whilst neutrophil-recruiting MIP-273 1 (CCL4), KC/CXCL 1, and eotaxin were all reduced following TH5487 treatment
    274 Interleukin-5 (IL-5) was significantly decreased in the BALF and plasma of TH5487-treated mice
 Involved 275 in numerous inflammatory processes in the lungs including IPF (35), IL-5 displays chemoattractant 276 properties for eosinophils, immune cells providing sources of TGF- and MCP-1 (36, )
 IL-9 was also 277 significantly decreased in both BALF and lung homogenate of TH 5487-treated mice
 IL-9 is Th2 cytokine 278 implicated in fibrosis, acting via receptors on macrophages, T/B lymphocytes, and mast cells
 High levels 279 of IL-9 have been found in both macrophages and CD4-positive cells in patients with IPF, with IL-9 280 blockade displaying decreased levels of silica-induced lung fibrosis ()
 Additionally, TGF-1 was shown 281 to be reduced in murine BALF, plasma, and lung homogenate following TH5487 treatment as compared to 282 vehicle/bleomycin treated mice
 Elevated TGF-, a potent inducer of ECM production and key mediator of 283 lung fibrosis, is directly linked to increases in collagen synthesis and deposition ()
 284 Furthermore, increases in the permeability of the pulmonary vasculature and plasma protein leakage have 285 been linked to the development of pulmonary fibrosis ()
 Plasma leakage into the BALF as a marker for 286 lung damage was assessed by the measurement of murine albumin content in the BALF

 Taken together, lung injury is 289 accompanied by inflammatory cytokine production, inflammatory cell infiltration, and ensuing fibrosis 290 To test this, inflammatory cell influx was measured in murine BALF via flow cytometry
 Interestingly, 292 fewer neutrophils and significantly fewer inflammatory macrophages were seen in TH5487-treated samples 293 compared to both dexamethasone/bleomycin and vehicle/bleomycin samples
 Giemsa-Wright stains of 294 BALF further elucidated the increase in inflammatory macrophage numbers in the bleomycin-treated 295 samples compared to TH5487/bleomycin samples
 Inflammatory cell incursion into the lung environment 296 plays a role in IPF progression and severity (16, 43), with limitation of lung inflammation providing a 297 Histological analysis of TH5487 murine lung samples revealed significantly decreased levels of collagen 299 deposition in lung tissues compared to vehicle/bleomycin treated samples
 Furthermore, H&E staining of 300 lung samples indicated significant reduction in lung damage and alveolar structural collapse
 Further, SEM 301 analysis of TH5487-treated samples revealed decreased thickening of alveolar walls and decreased 302 collagenous deposition compared to vehicle/bleomycin controls
 These results provide indicative in vivo 303 data of fibrosis reduction following TH5487 treatment
 Immunofluorescent staining of fibrotic related 304 proteins revealed decreased levels of both fibronectin and COL1A1 following TH5487 treatment
 305 Additional staining for neutrophil-associated myeloperoxidase (MPO) revealed decreases in neutrophil 306 influx into the lung environment following TH5487 treatment, as supported by similar neutrophil decreases 307 in the BALF flow cytometric analyses
 Subsequent co-staining for OGG1/COL1A1 indicates strong 308 signalling of both proteins in similar areas of the murine lung, with both OGG1 and COL1A1 decreased 309 following TH5487 treatment compared to both vehicle/bleomycin and dexamethasone/bleomycin groups
   310 TH5487 possesses a novel mechanism of action involving upstream gene-targeting of OGG1 using a small 311 molecule inhibitor
 This study further elucidates the downstream effects of this approach, decreasing 312 myofibroblast transition, epithelial and fibroblast migration, inflammatory cell recruitment, and eventual 313 inhibition of fibrotic-related lung remodelling
