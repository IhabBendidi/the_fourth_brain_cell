 ;    Methods : A 12-contacts cuff electrode was designed to selectively activate,without damage it, multi fascicular peripheral nerve ()
 Six subjects with atleast one extensor or one flexor muscle stimulable by surface electrical stimu-lation, have been enrolled into the study
 During the surgical procedure, radialor median nerve was stimulated through up to 35 different configurations ofstimulation at an intensity up to 
1 mA (25 Hz, pulse width 250 s, inter-pulse 100 s)
 Surface electrodes were positioned upon the forearm to recordResults: The multicontact cuff electrode allowed us to selectively activate groupof muscles to produce multiple, independent and functional hand and forearmThe incidence of SCIs in western Europe and the United States is estimated at 16 and 40 casesper million, respectively (2), with the high proportion of cervical injuries increasing progres-sively ()
 SCIs can have devastating impacts on patients health, autonomy and quality of life
Technical aids (e
 g
 motorized wheelchair, orthosis, medical electric bed, transfer board, homeautomation 
 
 
) allow to give back some independence to people with tetraplegia, but recoveryof gripping movements is still felt as the priority ()
 Indeed, most activities of daily livingare performed via hand movements and restoration of forearm, hand and wrist active motric-ity would significantly increase their independence and quality of life

 ;    functional potential of people with tetraplegia
 During tendonmuscle transfers, the distal partof a tendon and its functional muscle, is detached from its natural insertion point and then fixedon a non-functional adjacent muscle in order to restore its initial function
 For example, transferof the biceps brachii to the triceps brachii can restore elbow active extension, the residual flex-ion of the elbow being provided by the other flexors (brachialis and brachioradialis)
 However,these 2 methods require sufficient muscles or nerves under voluntary control, and rehabilitationdoes not allow for systematic recovery of desired movements
 Therefore, some people withtetraplegia are not able to undergo neurotendinous surgery
 In that case, implanted or externalFES can be an alternative to restore grip movements
 One of the first applications of FES onhand muscles is reported by Backhouse et al in 1954 ()
 Used to determine the function ofmuscles, FES was then used to recover grip movements in patients with a high tetraplegia asearly as 1963 ()
 Nowaday, only few devices using FES to restore or improve grip func-tions are available
 All of these devices use intramuscular, epimysial or surface electrodes ()and so, need one electrode for each muscle to activate
 However, the use of these devices is stillvery limited since they have limits in terms of acceptability, efficiency and benefit/limitationratio
 Furthermore, to achieve gripping movements, the higher the patients level of injury is,the greater the number of muscles to stimulate
 Activate more than one muscle by electrodebecomes relevant
 Neural stimulation would have the advantage to stimulate more muscles viaa single electrode (and so reduce implanted components), and will require less energy for mus-cle activation
 Studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach (1518), muscle thatwas selectively activated was the first muscle to branch distal to the cuff location
 However,they combined multisite neuromuscular stimulation which makes this approach complex andThe use of multipolar electrodes (poles 4) placed just above nerve bifurcations would makepossible, selective activation of several fascicles from the same nerve

 This selective activation could potentially activatedifferent functions and/or muscles independently
 Recruitment of agonist muscles via a singleelectrode may also be possible
 Alternative activation of agonist muscles could reduce muscleIn this study, we describe an approach based exclusively on neural stimulation to restore handmovements through a twelve contacts cuff electrode placed around upper-arm nerve (radial ormedian)
 Each of these contacts can be activated independently and so, current can be steeredin many ways into the nerve
 This technology could be used in combinaison with sus-lesionalEMG signals or movements (21) to control the nerve stimulation
 Thereby, individuals withtetraplegia, who can not benefit from a musculotendinous surgery, would be provided with ahand neuroprosthesis, usable in a clinical context, and allowing grasp movements recovery
6 patients with a C5 complete motor cervical injury were included in our experimental protocol
The protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (#ID-RCB: 2014-A01752-45) andexperiments performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
 Each patient signedan informed consent
 The tests were performed during a scheduled surgery - a tendon transferto recover elbow extension - avoiding a dedicated surgery
 Moreover the experimental timeslot was 30 min to let the anesthesia below 2 hours in total Thus, a unique nerve was intra-operatively tested on each patient
 Median or radial nerve was chosen depending on the surgicalapproach
 The protocol was composed of 2 sessions: the first one consisted in a functionalmapping of the targeted muscles groups namely thumb, fingers and wrist flexion/extensionthat leads to the inclusion of the patient
 The second session consisted in the surgery itself

 Systems using muscular surface electrodes are bigger, require more energy to stim-ulate muscles and are less selective and reliable than systems using implanted electrodes
 Cur-rently, there is no commercialized implanted neuroprosthesis available to restore hand move-ments in persons with tetraplegia
 The functional improvement provided by the Freehandsystem was considerable and impossible to achieve by other means available
 However, thissystem had shown several disadvantages (13, )
 One can cite the numerous implantedmaterials lengthening the duration of the surgery and limiting drastically the possibility of bi-lateralization, essential to some activities of daily living
 Human assistance needed daily forplacement of external components and poor ergonomic control mode were additional limits
In this study, we have shown that it is possible, thanks to current steering allowed by a -contacts cuff electrode, to selectively activate, close and distinct muscles innervated by thesame upper limb nerve
 Moreover, some of the superficial muscles were activated during thesecond step (implanted nerve stimulation) but were not during the first step (surface muscleIn the past, use of multipolar cuff electrodes, has selectively activated a single muscle, typicallythe first muscle to branch distal to the cuff location ()
 In our study, the same pattern ofstimulation reproduced at

 For these two last points, we can expect a func-tional improvement over time, if a muscle reinforcement by surface electrical stimulation takesDuring a nerve electrical stimulation, motor neurons with larger diameter (e
 g
 those that in-nervate type IIb muscle fibers, fast and fatigable) are activated first, followed by activation ofsmaller diameter motor neurons
 This recruitment property is the opposite of the physiologicalrecruitment order ()
 Furthermore, the intensity of the stimulus produced by an electricalstimulation decreases with its distance from the source of stimulation
 Therefore, the motorneurons closest to the electrode and of larger diameter are the most stimulated
 Finally, con-trary to a voluntary contraction, an electrical stimulation (neural or neuromuscular) recruits themuscle fibers in the same order
 There is no longer a rotation system (32) for fibers recruit-ment and so, induces early muscle fatigue
 In this study, we have seen that it is possible toactivate the same muscles with different configurations of stimulation and so it would be possi-During our experiments, a weak space between the electrode and the nerve was present
 We be-lieve that the diameter of the cuff electrodes must be able to fit the exact diameter of the nerve
This, would optimally stimulate the nerve and allow ENG signals recording
 These signalsmight be integrated into the neuroprosthesis and used as a closed-loop control
This study showed that two electrodes placed around two upper limb nerves allow to restorehand and forearm movements in patients with tetraplegia
 Possible ways to pilot this stimula-tion have been investigated in previous studies (33), which showed that sus-lesional muscles canbe used to pilot a surface electrical stimulation (unpublished data)
