 On the neural level these deficits have been closely linked to direct control over these pathways could therefore provide an innovative and promising strategy to regulate exaggerated anxiety
 To this end the current proof-of-concept study evaluated the feasibility, functional relevance and maintenance of a novel connectivity-controlled design high anxious subjects (n = 26) underwent real-time fMRI-guided training to enhance connectivity between the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and the amygdala (target pathway) during threat exposure
 Maintenance of regulatory control was assessed after three days and in the absence of feedback
 Training-induced changes in functional connectivity of the target pathway and anxiety ratings served as primary outcomes
 Training of the target, yet not the sham-control, pathway significantly increased amygdala-vlPFC connectivity and decreased subjective anxiety levels
 On the individual level stronger volitional control over the target pathway and decreased anxiety level were maintained in the absence of feedback

  The functional interplay between and clinical relevance of ER and anxiety mirrors across different levels of observation
 In healthy subjects, ER capability prospectively predicts anxiety levels for periods up to five years ()
 The clinical relevance is further emphasized by randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) indicating that improved ER predicts symptom reduction in anxiety disorders (1012) 
 On the neural level efficient regulation of threat and anxiety is neurally underpinned by top-down governance of the amygdala, which is critically engaged in threat responsivity (13), via prefrontal regulatory regions (14, )
 Within these regulatory circuits the ventrolateral (vlPFC) and dorsomedial (dmPFC) prefrontal cortex are considered to specifically support explicit/volitional control of threat via downregulation of the amygdala (5, 15, )
 Deficits in this top-down regulatory mechanism have been identified across major psychiatric disorders the prefrontal cortex and concomitantly exaggerated amygdala activity in the context of attenuated functional interplay between these regions ()
 The therapeutic relevance of these pathways is further emphasized by studies reporting that anxiety reduction following dysregulations, it has yet to directly have a therapeutic impact ()
 Given that the currently moderate response rates and potential negative side effects (2426), innovative treatments that directly target the identified brain markers are needed ()
 Within this context, the emergence of real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rt-fMRI NF) training approaches that allow subjects to gain volitional control over regional brain activity have been considered as a potential of rt-fMRI NF by demonstrating that training success in terms of control over regional activity can be maintained beyond the training session (3134), and that training-induced neural activity changes can modulate emotional experience in healthy subjects (31) Initial studies have begun to evaluate the therapeutic potential of rt-fMRI NF in clinical regions such as the insula and amygdala can successfully decreased symptoms in patients with major depression ()

 In line with current neuro-circuitry models of ER, successful down-regulation of the amygdala was accompanied by increased functional connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal regulatory regions in both, healthy subjects (39, 42) as well as Summarizing, the current literature suggests that (a) successful ER relies on top-down regulation of the amygdala via prefrontal regions and that (b) rt-fMRI NF-assisted modulation of these regions has the potential to modulate ER and anxious arousal In the context of recent circuit level models of ER (for circuit-level deficits in psychiatric disorders see (44)), evaluating whether (1) rt-fMRI NF has the potential to directly allow regulatory control of the successful regulatory control decreases levels of anxiety in individuals with high anxiety, and (3) volitional control can be maintained in the absence of feedback and over a period of To increase the clinical relevance of the present proof-of-concept study while controlling for healthy subjects with high anxiety (trait anxiety scores > 40, assessed by STAI (45)) were recruited
 Given that the main aim was to evaluate the feasibility and functional relevance of related variation in ER (46), as well as sex-differences in emotion regulation (47) and associated connectivity in the target pathway (48) were controlled for by focusing on a male sample
 Detailed eligibility criteria and sample characteristics are provided in the Supplementary Materials
 All subjects provided written informed consent
 The study had full ethical approval by the local ethics committee, adhered to the latest reversion of the Participants were scheduled for four MRI sessions: rt-fMRI NF training of the amygdala-vlPFC target pathway (EXP) plus transfer/maintenance assessment after two days (M-EXP) and rt-fMRI NF sham (SHC) training plus transfer/maintenance assessment after two days (M-SHC)
 During the training sessions feedback was provided but not during the transfer/maintenance sessions
 Training sessions used identical procedures including four subsequent NF training runs and during the sham session participants received connectivity feedback from a pathway connecting regions not engaged in ER (bilateral motor cortices, M1 ())
 The SHC served to control for unspecific effects of training, and together with the within-subject design allowed a thorough control of potential confounders

 For randomized allocation of the order of trainings a random number generator was used
 Training sessions were separated by an interval of 2-3 weeks and subjects were informed that they had to discover new strategies each time
 Both training sessions were preceded by fMRI-localizer paradigms to determine the pathways used for feedback during EXP and SHC (see Localizer-paradigms)
 Two days after each training session, participants underwent two transfer runs (M-EXP/M-SHC) during which they were required to perform regulation with the same strategy they had learned during the preceding training but without feedback being provided (protocols see Figure )
 To evaluate the functional relevance of training success, anxiety levels assessed before and after each session and served as primary behavioral outcome
 To control confounding effects of pre-training mood and anxiety states these were assessed additionally immediately before regulation nodes (EXP, right amygdala and right vlPFC, emotion localizer) and the bilateral motor cortices (SHC, bilateral M1, motor localizer)
 These regions-of-interest (ROIs) for the T1-weighted brain-structural images of each subject were overlaid with the real-time localizer activity in native space
 Subsequently, thresholded peak activity regions within the target structures were manually delineated (standardized ROI size) and used for the subsequent training
 To further control for movement effects on functional connectivity (49) and physiological artifacts such as respiration and noise from cardiac activity, a third ROI was During the neurofeedback training (NFT) strong negative (threatening) stimuli were displayed with real-time neurofeedback displayed by thermometer bars on both sides (Figure 1, stimuli details see Supplementary Material)
 Each of the four NFT runs included four blocks of threatening pictures (six pictures per block, inter-block interval 30 seconds fixation, pictures presented for 5 seconds, size gradually increased from half to full size stepped by the TR to increase threat)
 Rt-fMRI connectivity (FC) between the ROIs was calculated as a partial correlation between the time series from the two pathway ROIs (amygdala-vlPFC or bilateral M1) while including the time series from the white matter ROI as a covariate (details see ())
 The FC thermometer was updated in real-time (logged to the TR =

  Participants were informed that the purpose of the training was to enhance their emotion regulation abilities to improve coping with negative emotional events in daily life and reduce stress
 Participants were instructed to learn to control the threatening feelings evoked by the pictures while breathing normally
 To increase their regulation ability, the neural emotion regulation success would be presented to them (thermometer bars corresponding to better success) and they should aim to develop a strategy to increase the bars

 Finally, subjects were informed that the feedback would be computed in real-time but displayed with approximately 10 seconds delay (see also Evaluation of training success on The primary behavioral outcome to evaluate the functional relevance of the target pathway training was determined as training-induced changes in subjective anxiety levels as assessed by visual analog scales (VAS, anxiety levels from 0 to 100) administered before and after each training session

 A previous study showed that a 12-second time window had comparable sensitivity in detecting task-relevant connectivity changes as a longer time window (26s) for a finger tapping task ()
 Since valid online connectivity feedback started at ~

 Estimates were further analyzed using SPSS by means of repeated measure ANOVAs and post-hoc tests controlled for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni-correction
 In line with our previous study we additionally evaluated training success by comparing differences in connectivity strengths between the first two and the last two Three subjects did not display above-threshold activity in the vlPFC during the emotional localizer and their data was thus excluded from all analysis, resulting in n = 23 for the final analyses

 Moreover, previous clinical studies have emphasized the relevance of the amygdala-PFC circuits for treatment success, with changes in this pathway predictive of symptom-reduction after cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (20) and anxiolytic drug treatment (21, 22) in patients with exaggerated anxiety
 In line with our hypothesis, successful training of the target pathway resulted in associated-decreases in anxiety ratings thereby confirming both the important role of the amygdala-vlPFC pathway in the regulation of anxiety as well as the functional relevance of the training
 To increase the clinical relevance of the present proof-of-concept study subjects with high anxiety were recruited, and the training-associated decrease in anxious-arousal thus suggests that amygdala-vlPFC training may have to potential to normalize deficient prefrontal control of the amygdala and exaggerated levels of Of particular relevance for the application of NF-training approaches in clinical practice (30, 60, 61), the present study observed that subjects were able to maintain the control over the emotion regulation pathway and its effect on anxiety decrease in the absence of feedback and for a period of at least three days
 These findings are in line with previous studies evaluating transfer and maintenance effects of rt-fMRI NF-assisted control over regional brain activity (31, 62), and additionally suggest that successful neuro-modulatory control on the pathway-level can last beyond the duration of the initial training and thus transfer to Despite increasing interest in the application of rt-fMRI only a few studies to date have brain regions (50, )
 In line with the present findings, a previous study with a relatively small sample of healthy subjects revealed initial evidence for the feasibility of connectivity-informed NF which was associated with increased perception of positive valence stimuli
 Importantly, the present study demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in decreasing anxious arousal, a transdiagnostic psychopathology marker (3), in subjects with high anxiety levels and thus may represent and important initial step towards the clinical application of approaches are encouraging, there is still considerable room for improvement to promote transfer into clinical practice
 For instance, the present study found preliminary evidence that anxiety attenuation was maintained after three days, however no further reduction was observed during the transfer session
 Future studies should explore whether improved training strategies (52) and more intense or longer training schedules may lead to more robust and enduring behavioral effects in the absence of neurofeedback

 ;    were observed suggesting that some individuals are more likely to benefit from functional -connectivity-based training than others
 Future studies are needed to identify optimal neural or behavioral predictors of training success allowing better selection of individuals who may benefit most from rt-fMRI NF training approaches
 Recent findings suggest that baseline anxiety (66) or behavioral performance (69) may represent promising behavioral markers, although robust training-success predictors on the neural level remain to be determined
  Although the within-subject design, inclusion of a sham-control training and the pre-registration of the primary outcomes permitted a rigorous control for a number of potential confounds, the present findings still need to be considered in the context of some limitations
 First, to allow an evaluation of the training independent of menstrual-cycle or gender effects on ER and associated neural activity (4648), our proof-of-concept study focused on male participants
 The question of whether training success generalizes to female subjects and potential sex-differences therefore remains to be addressed
 For clinical practice it will be important to compare both training and functional outcome success using cost of longer delay times and higher dimensionality (68) such that learning with this signal may be more demanding, possibly limiting efficacy in patients with cognitive impairments
