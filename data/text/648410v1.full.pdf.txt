 A multicenter, UK, 16-week phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 12-weeks treatment with AZD4017 or placebo was conducted
 Women aged 18 to 55 years with active idiopathic were included
 Participants received 400mg twice daily of oral AZD4017 compared to matching placebo over -weeks
 The outcome measures were initial efficacy, safety and tolerability
 The primary clinical outcome was lumbar puncture opening pressure at 12 weeks analysed by headache and anthropological measures
 In vivo efficacy was evaluated in the central nervous system and systemically
 31 subjects (mean age 
2 (SD=
9) years and BMI 
2 (SD=

 At 12 weeks, lumbar puncture pressure was lower in the AZD4017 group (
7 cmH2O) compared with placebo (
3 cmH2O), but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (mean difference: -

 ;    Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a debilitating condition characterized by raised intracranial pressure (ICP), papilledema with risk of permanent visual loss,(Mollan et al, 2018b) and chronic headaches which reduce quality of life
(Mulla et al, 2015) IIH predominately affects obese women between the ages of 25-36 years with a distinct androgen excess signature recently identified
(Daniels et al, 2007; Markey et al, 2016; O'Reilly et al, 2019) Incidence is increasing in line with escalating worldwide obesity rates
(Mollan et al, 2018a)  Surgical treatment is recommended when vision rapidly declines,(Mollan et al, 2014; Mollan et al, 2018c) but the majority of patients (93%) are managed conservatively
(Hoffmann et al, 2018; Mollan et al, 2018a; Mollan et al, 2018b) Dietary interventions are an effective treatment,(Sinclair et al, 2010a) however, meaningful and sustained weight loss is difficult to achieve
(Colquitt et al, 2014; Manfield et al, 2017) Pharmacotherapy in IIH is limited,(Piper et al, 2015) with only two previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in IIH previously reported, both evaluating acetazolamide
(Ball et al, 2011; Committee et al, 2014) New We have previously demonstrated that the enzyme 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11-HSD1) is expressed and active in the choroid plexus (CP) to amplify cortisol availability and acts to regulate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production

(Sandeep et al, 2005) Selective inhibitors of 11-HSD1 have been developed as treatments for obesity, hepatic steatosis, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes
(Boyle, 2008; Stefan et al, 2014) Based on these data, 11-HSD1 could represent a therapeutic target for lowering CSF pressure
 AZD4017 is a highly selective, fully reversible, competitive 11-HSD1 inhibitor
 It has been tested over short time intervals in healthy males (9 days), and abdominally obese subjects (10 days), and found to be safe and tolerable
(AstraZeneca, 2000-[01 March 2017]-a, b, c, d, 2000-[01 March ]
) The ability of AZD4017 to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) is not established; however, the CP lies outside the BBB and consequently can be targeted directly following oral We hypothesised that inhibition of 11-HSD1 could be therapeutically beneficial in IIH
 To test this we conducted a multicenter phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT in IIH using the selective 11-HSD1 inhibitor AZD4017, aiming to assess therapeutic efficacy, safety and tolerability, and investigate in vivo systemic and central nervous system efficacy

 ;    We report the first phase 2 RCT assessing 11-HSD1 inhibitor AZD4017 for the treatment of IIH
 We have shown some possible clinical benefit for AZD4017, and that it was well tolerated and safe
  We found evidence for effective in vivo 11-HSD1 inhibition
  Our primary hypothesis stated that 11-HSD1 inhibition in IIH patients would reduce CSF secretion and lower ICP while being safe and tolerable following 12 weeks of treatment
 ICP was the primary clinical outcome measure, representing the hallmark of the disease driving clinical sequelae
 At 12 weeks, although ICP was lower in the AZD4017 group compared to placebo, the difference between groups was not statistically significant
  Exploratory analyses of the mean change within groups found a significant improvement in ICP in the AZD4017 group between baseline and 12 weeks, but not in the placebo group
 Previous trials have noted that ICP reduction below the cut off of 25 cmH2O is not universally required to translate into resolution of IIH clinical features
(Sinclair et al, 2010b) A minimal clinically important change in ICP in IIH has not been determined, and establishing one would be useful for future trials
   The visual field perimetric assessment is another clinically meaningful measure and has been selected as the primary outcome measures in previous IIH trials
 We found no difference between groups in PMD at 12 weeks, however, there was significant improvement over time in the AZD4017 arm but not in the placebo arm
 This may reflect the pragmatic recruitment of all degrees of PMD at enrolment whilst other trials have enrolled a selected cohort (e

(Mulla et al, 2015) We did not detect differences between the groups in any of the headache assessments at 12 weeks, although data from the patient completed HIT-6 favoured the AZD4017 group
 Evaluating the effect of AZD4017 on headache measures over a longer treatment duration would be of interest
 Previous trials showed that 11-HSD1 inhibition leads to adaptive changes in HPA stimulatory hormone ACTH and the adrenal androgen precursor DHEA
 Our data support these findings, but with no significant change in downstream effector hormones (cortisol and testosterone)
  In vivo evaluation of our patients demonstrated that AZD4017 was a highly effective systemic and hepatic 11-HSD1 inhibitor, in line with previous studies using11-HSD1 inhibitors in humans(Schwab et al, 2017),(Courtney et al, )
 Systemic efficacy may modify metabolic aspects of IIH with indirect benefits on ICP
(Hornby et al, 2018)  While AZD4017 effectively inhibited 11-HSD1 when applied to subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue explants, we were unable to prove inhibition in vivo, and propose that 11-HSD1 activity recovers over the assay period once removed from AZD4017, a reversible competitive Blood-brain-barrier AZD4017 penetrance was low, with levels in the CSF

 We have evaluated efficacy of other IIH drugs using rodent ICP monitoring models,(Botfield et al, 2017; Scotton et al, 2018) but AZD4017 is only effective in humans and primates, thus limiting our ability to evaluate its action in rodent models
 The trial duration was likely too short
 A duration of 12 weeks was chosen for evaluation of safety and tolerability and represented the longest duration of dosing to date with AZ
 This may not have been sufficient for meaningful evaluation of clinical outcomes with other IIH RCTs evaluating drugs over a 6 month period
(Committee et al, 2014) The enrolment criteria for the study were deliberately broad allowing inclusion of a spectrum of IIH patients with active disease and ensuring generalizability of results; however, this did not allow evaluation in disease subgroups such as those with mild visual loss vs
 those with severe irreversible visual loss
 Finally, the sample size (31 participants) is small which may have limited meaningful evaluation of clinical measures and the trial was not design to establish significant changes in the secondary This is the first phase II study evaluating the novel pharmacological therapy AZD4017 in IIH
