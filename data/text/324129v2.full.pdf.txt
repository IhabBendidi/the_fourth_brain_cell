 ;     Locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) is particularly difficult to treat given that it exhibits a poor response to chemotherapy and is by definition unresectable
 A large proportion of patients experience significant morbidity and mortality due to local progression
 As systemic therapy improves with the advent of gemcitabine/ abraxane1 and FOLFIRINOX2, the burden of local disease will only increase
 Standard radiation therapy doses have failed to improve survival, which is not unexpected given anatomical and technical limitations
 Although the LAP-07 trial3 failed to show an overall survival benefit to radiation at standard doses, it did show benefits in terms of local control and time off of chemotherapy
 At higher radiation doses, however, our institutional data suggests improved overall survival (
8 months vs 15 months)4 and recurrence-free survival (
2 months vs 
2 months), in addition to decreased acute grade 3+ gastrointestinal toxicity (1% vs 14%)5 even at higher doses (BED>70Gy) with  Given these initial retrospective data, we initiated a phase I/II adaptive dose escalation trial using image guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for LAPC maximum tolerated dose using SBRT
 In preparation for the activation of this protocol, we undertook a dosimetric feasibility study to determine a) whether all patients treated with IMRT could have also been planned with SBRT and b) the maximum feasible delivered biological effective dose (BED) using SBRT while maintaining standard organ at risk (OAR) constraints to gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa with daily imaging, motion certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

5Gy in 15 fractions) were randomly selected from our previously published cohort in order to obtain a fair distribution of patients
  All patients received 4 to 6 disease based on a multidisciplinary review of computed tomography (CT) images using located >5mm from GI mucosa (OARs) with no predefined size limit, while SD-SBRT patients had tumors <4cm in maximal dimension with no evidence of duodenal invasion DE-IMRT and DE-SBRT patients were immobilized using upper body vac-lock cradles
 All patients were simulated NPO for three hours, using intravenous (IV) contrast and inspiration breath hold (IBH) with 5-6 scans for reproducibility
 Typically two IBH CT scans were acquired without IV contrast followed by 3-4 IBH CT scans acquired after IV certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    contrast injection performed in intervals of approximately 30 s between scans beginning 30 seconds after IV contrast administration
 Simulation technique and example IBH CT validated by two separate physicians (LE and CT) with identical targets using commercial treatment planning software (Phillips Pinnacle version 
 )
  The IBH CT images were used to contour an integrated GTV (iGTV) and integrated OAR structures (iDuodenum, iStomach and iSmallBowel; Figure a)
 This is a similar concept to a movement of a target
 The iOAR structures were uniformly expanded by 5mm expansion to create a GI mucosa planning risk volume (GI_PRV)
 Example contours are For each DE-IMRT and SD-SBRT, we attempted to created a dose-escalated SBRT (DE-SBRT) plan with an SIB to 40 Gy (8Gy/fx) and 70Gy (14Gy/fx) in 5 fractions
  The PTV_40 was created by adding 3mm to the iGTV and subtracting the GI_PRV
 A PTV_70 was created from the iGTV with 3mm contraction in 3 dimensions
 DE-IMRT patients were re-planned for a 40Gy in 5 fractions SBRT plan and a 40Gy in 5 fraction plan with an increased simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) dose until the highest possible dose was reached (up to 70 Gy), while maintaining set OAR constraints (Table )
 The ten SD-SBRT patients were re-planned with a DE-IMRT plan and a DE-SBRT plan with an increased SIB

 This was not used in our study to simplify plan comparisons, but areas of increased dose were pushed posteriorly to Planning was performed in one of the IV contrast IBH CT scans without density override for the IV contrast
 40Gy was prescribed to the PTV_40 with a SIB technique prescribing 70Gy to the PTV_
 There was no minimum coverage requirement for the iGTV, but >95% coverage was requested for the PTVs
 OARs were prioritized during IMRT planning over target coverage
 Successful plans typically had between 7 and 12 coplanar beam angles
 VMAT was acceptable if available for treatment delivery with breathhold
 Example treatment plans are presented in Figure 
  Based on toxicities observed in previous SBRT trials and the associated constraints (Table 1), dose 40Gy)/ prescription target volume (PTV) and homogeneity index was calculated using both D95/D5 and Dmax/Dmin formulas
 Gradient index was calculated using 50% PIV / Descriptive statistics were generated for all targets and all OAR

 A minimum coverage percent of 60 percent was defined as acceptable for All DE-IMRT were treated in a Clinac 2100 EX (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a CT on rails (CTOR) (Smart Gantry, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL)
 SD-SBRT patients were treated in a Truebeam (Varian Medical System) or the Clinac 2100 EX
 For CTOR treatments, patients were initially set up under IBH using radiopaque skin marks placed on the planning final isocenter followed by CTOR under IBH
  In-house software (Court and Dong 2003, Med Phys 30:2750) was used to register the CTOR to the planning CT using a contour of the vertebral body located just posterior to the iGTV
  The final targets were then manually aligned using the implanted fiducial markers
  The auto registration software then provides the couch shifts relative to the radiopaque skin marks to align the patient to the treatment final isocenter
 Finally, a MV image pair is acquired to verify the bony alignment and treatment is delivered
 For the Truebeam treatments, patients were initially set up to the planning final isocenter then aligned to fiducials using a kilovoltage image pair with cone beam CT (CBCT) for verification
 Schema for standard treatment delivery using CTOR is given in Figure 
  Clinically acceptable DE-SBRT plans based on iGTV and PTV coverage and OAR constraints were generated for 100% of patients originally treated with DE-IMRT
 Acceptable DE-IMRT plans were also generated for 100% of patients originally planned certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 The following OAR constraints were achieved for 90% of generated  Dosimetrically, all patients treated with IMRT could also have been treated with SBRT, with similar (or improved) BED delivery
 Given this, it is worth investigating SBRT techniques for patient convenience and continuity of systemic therapy
 Based on the 90th percentile used in the above data, dose escalation with an SIB technique to 60Gy in 5 fractions is achievable while maintaining acceptable target coverage and standard OAR constraints
  We note that our study was enriched in patients with more favorable anatomy (uncinate and body tumors), but we believe that our approach and dose constraints would also apply to any patient that is eligible for pancreatic SBRT

 ;    Our SIB approach covered the GTV between 60% and 80% by the highest doses while still maintaining >98% PTV coverage by the 40Gy line
 Pancreatic tumors are particularly hypoxic at their core7, and delivering high doses to this hypoxic core may have a radiobiologic advantage despite not achieving full target coverage
 This concept is similar to acceptance of dose heterogeneity within the GTV in other forms of SBRT
 Past SBRT trials, even with three and one fraction regimens have shown that duodenum, small bowel and stomach constraints of V20<30cc, V35<1cc, and max dose<40Gy are safe and well tolerated (Table )
 Using the above planning technique, these same dose constraints are achievable in 90% of cases, which supports the idea that dose escalation for LAPC is feasible and should be investigated in clinical trials
  Our data provide a roadmap for other clinicians looking to achieve dose escalation up to 60Gy in 5 fractions for pancreatic cancer in the appropriate setting
