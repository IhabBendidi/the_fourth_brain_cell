 e
, electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) and Tobacco Heating Products (THPs), are rapidly growing in popularity
 The marketing of these products is regulated by specific rules in the European Union and in the US, which permit their legal are still under development
 Cytotoxicity studies are an important initial step in appraising the potential toxicity of ENDS
 The aim of the present study was to screen a battery of different in vitro cytotoxicity methods for the assessment of toxicity induced by ENDS
 We evaluated (HCS) assays and Real Time Cell Analysis (RTCA), to compare two e-cigs (Vype ePen 3 and Vype eStick Maxx) and two THPs (IQOS and GLO) with the 1R6F reference tobacco ciga-rette
 Human bronchial epithelial cells (H292) were exposed to 1R6F smoke (5 puffs by HCI regime), ePen vapor (10 puffs by modified HCI regime), eStick vapor (25 puffs by CRM81 regime), IQOS vapor (7 puffs by HCI regime) and GLO vapor (8 puffs by HCI regime) at air-liquid interface
 All tests showed reduced cell viability following 1R6F smoke exposure and slight or no reduction with ENDS at 24 hours compared to controls
 In addition, Annexin V and RTCA exhibited a further significant reduction in cell viability following 1R6F exposure compared with other assays
 Furthermore, Annexin V allowed to discriminate viable cells from those in early/late apoptosis
 Finally, RTCA and HCS being time-resolved analyses al-lowed also to determine the kinetic dependency parameter for toxicity of smoke/vapor chemi-cals on cell viability
 In conclusion, NRU assay may be considered a suitable test, especially when combined with a time-resolved test, for assessing the kinetic of cytotoxicity induced by  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 26,

 ;    Cytotoxicity assays have been widely used to assess the toxicological impact of tobacco smoke (Belushkin et al, )
 Indeed, regulatory authorities included in vitro toxicity tests in a battery of assays to detect all possible toxicity effects of tobacco products (Belushkin et al, 2014; CORESTA, )
 Consequently, these toxicity assays are routinely used as standard methods by tobacco industry for product assessments (Baker et al, 2004a, 2004b; Dempsey et al, )
 More recently marketing of alternative tobacco products, generally referred as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), including electronic cigarettes (e-cig) and tobacco heating products (THPs), increased the need to properly assess their potential toxic effects (Johnson et al, )
 Currently, alternative tobacco products are tested following the standard approach used for tobacco products, but a more specific approach for e-cig and THPs could improve their toxicity assessment (Iskandar et al, )
 However, the rapid evolution of these products, and their large variability, due to the lack of manufacturing standard, make it difficult to develop standard protocols for toxicity assessment (Davis et al, 2015; Iskandar et al, 2016; Kim et al, )
 Neutral red uptake (NRU) is the most used assay for cytotoxicity evaluation in the context of tobacco products testing (Belushkin et al, 2014), and it is also included in the first non-genotoxicity in vitro assay accepted for the regulatory evaluation of chemical compounds (European Commission, 2000; OECD/OCDE, 2004; Repetto et al, )
 The NRU cytotoxicity test is a cell survival/viability chemosensitivity test based on the ability of viable cells to incorporate and bind neutral red (NR), a weak supra-vital cationic dye that freely penetrates cell membranes by non-ionic diffusion and accumulates in lysosomes
 Alterations of biological membranes leading to lysosomal fragility and other changes caused by the action of the chemical mixture (e
 g
, cigarette smoke) can result in a decrease in the absorption and binding of NR
 This makes it possible to distinguish between viable, damaged  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 26, 
 ;    or dead cells
 The degree of inhibition of growth, related to the concentration of the test compound, provides an indication of cytotoxicity expressed as a reduction in NR absorption after chemical exposure, thus providing a sensitive signal of both cell integrity and growth inhibition (Putnam et al, 2002; Repetto et al, 2008; The National Toxicology Program 2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT, thiazolyl blue) is the most used among them
 The water-soluble MTT salts are incorporated by viable cells due to their net positive charge, and then reduced by dehydrogenases and other reducing agents contained in metabolically active cells (Berridge et al, 2005; Stockert et al, )
 The reduction of MTT leads to the formation of insoluble violet-blue formazan product, which are proportional to cell viability (Berridge et al, 2005; Johnson et al, )
 The use of the above-described methods has some drawbacks since they do not discriminate among apoptosis, necrosis or autophagy thus leading to a possible underestimation of toxicity
  Indeed, the induction of programmed cell death (i
 e
, apoptosis) and necrosis processes represent crucial steps in the evaluation of cytotoxicity
 In particular, though apoptosis is not an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, it is well known that cigarette smoke induces apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells (Comer et al, 2013; Imai et al, )
 Annexin V evaluation by cytofluorimetric analysis to assess apoptosis represents a useful tool to measure of cytotoxicity even though it with an overall overview of biological response and monitoring them continuously over time (Iskandar et al, )
 These new rapid methods, alongside with the classic cytotoxicity assay, could provide a deeper knowledge on toxicity of alternative tobacco products
 Two of  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 26, 
 ;    these new methods are the High content screening (HCS)-based multiparametric analysis and the Real-Time Cell-based Assay (RTCA) technology
 HCS analysis represents a useful tool in early toxicity testing because it allows to measure simultaneously numerous parameters stress and morphological parameters without the use of specific dyes (Mandavilli et al, )
 Instead RTCA, a real-time cellular biosensor, allows for uninterrupted, label free, and real time analysis of cells over the course of an experiment with the advantages of avoiding marks, violation to the cell, and overcoming the interference of the compounds in detection Since there is not a specific indication or protocol for toxicity evaluation of e-cig and THPs products on human bronchial epithelial cells, we evaluated a number of in vitro cytotoxicity assays (i
 e
, NRU assay, MTT assay, Annexin V apoptosis assay, NRU assay, HCS and RTCA technologies) by comparing two brands of e-cig (Vype ePen 3 and Vype eStick Maxx), two THPs (IQOS and GLO) with the 1R6F research cigarettes using human  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 26, 
 ;    1R6F reference cigarettes (Center for Tobacco Reference Products, University of Kentucky) were used for smoke exposure
 These cigarettes have been reported to produce 
8 mg TPM, 
1 mg tar and 
896 mg nicotine per cigarette smoked following HCI regime (Center for Tobacco Reference Products Kentucky University, )
  Cigarettes were conditioned at 221 C and 603 % of relative humidity for at least 48 hours according to ISO 3402:1999 guidelines
 LM1 smoking machine (Borgwaldt KC GmbH, Hamburg  Germany) was used to smoke 5 puffs of 1R6F cigarette following HCI regime which ensures a 55 ml, 2 s duration bell shape profile, puff every 30 s with filter vent blocked
 Vapor exposure was carried out using two electronic cigarettes, Vype ePen 3 and Vype eStick (British American Tobacco;   (Azzopardi et al, 2016) and two THPs, IQOS Duo (Philip Morris  Vype ePen3 is a closed-system e-cigarette with a cotton wick comprising a rechargeable 650 mAh battery and actuation button, and a disposable cartridge with integral mouthpiece
 The device has a single 6 W power setting
 Vype eStick is puff-activated cigarette-like product consisting of two modules, a rechargeable battery section and a replaceable liquid (e-liquid) containing cartridge (cartomizer) operating at 
7 V (Azzopardi et al, )
 IQOS Duo consists of three distinct components that perform different functions: (i) a tobacco stick containing a tobacco powder with the addition of water, glycerin, guar gum and cellulose fibers, (ii) a holder into which the tobacco stick is inserted and which heats the tobacco material by means of an electronically controlled heating blade from inside the tobacco stick, and (iii) a charger that is used to recharge the holder after one or two uses
 The temperature of the heating blade is carefully controlled and  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 26, 
 ;    the operating temperature does not exceed 350C (Bekki et al, 2017; Li et al, )
 GLO Pro includes two parts: an electronic handheld device with a heating chamber equipped with a rechargeable Li-ion battery (3000 mAh capacity), and a custom-made tobacco rod to be inserted into the heating chamber
 The electronic device has a heating module separately controlled by the inbuilt software, and thus, the tobacco rod is heated to less than 250C from the periphery
 This is significantly lower than the major pyrolysis and combustion temperature ranges seen in a lit cigarette (typically between 350C and 900C) but is sufficient to release nicotine, glycerol (added as the main aerosol agent) and volatile tobacco flavor compounds (Eaton et al, )
 Master Blend flavored variant containing 18 mg/mL nicotine was used for Vype ePen3, Toasted Tobacco flavored variant containing 18 mg/mL nicotine was used for Vype eStick Maxx, Heets Sienna Selection was used for IQOS duo, and Neo Sticks Ultramarine was used for GLO Pro
 Vapor exposure was performed using LM4E vaping machine (Borgwaldt KC GmbH, Hamburg  Germany)
 Vype ePen3 (button-activated e-cigarette) was vaped following a modified HCI regimen (55 mL puff volume, drawn over 2 s, once every 30 s with square shape profile) plus 1 s of pre-activation, for 10 puffs
 Vype eStick Maxx was vaped following CRM81 regimen (55 mL puff volume, drawn over 3 s, once every 30 s with square shape profile) for 25 puffs
 IQOS Duo and GLO Pro were vaped using HCI regime without blocking the filter vents, to avoid the device overheating, for 7 and 8 puffs respectively
 The ENDS product batteries were fully charged before use and a fresh e-liquid cartridge for e-cig were used
 The puff number for each product was established according to nicotine dose delivered from 1R6F causing the 50% of cell death (data not shown), in order to have the similar nicotine  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 26, 
 ;    cultured as described previously by Azzopardi et al 2015 ()
 Briefly, H292 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (10% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin) at 37 C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere
 Then, cells were seeded in 12 mm Transwells inserts (Corning Incorporated, NY, USA) at a density of 3x105 cells/ml sustained by 1 ml of RPMI medium in the basal compartment of each well and 
5 ml in the apical compartment of each Transwell insert, 48 hours prior to exposure
 Cell starvation was done 24 hours prior to exposure by replacing the basal and apical medium with 1 mL and 
5 mL respectively of UltraCULTURE containing 2 mM glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 g/mL streptomycin
 Next, when the 80% confluency was reached, the apical medium was removed from each insert and two inserts per test product were transitioned to the exposure chamber with 20 ml of DMEM-high glucose (DMEM-hg) in the basal compartment in order to perform the air-liquid interface (ALI) exposure (Fig
 )
 This exposure method is the most physiologically relevant for bronchial epithelial cell lines (e
 g
, H292) exposing them to all fractions and components of smoke/vapor (Azzopardi et al, )
 For each smoking/vaping regime, one exposure chamber was connected to the LM4E port without the device so as to expose H292 cells to laboratory air filtered by a Cambridge Filter Pad at the same regime (AIR control)
 Moreover, 2 negative controls, consisting of 1 seeded insert with media submerged (INC) and 1 seeded insert without apical media (ALI) in the incubator, and 1 positive control with 1 ml apical and 2 ml basal sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) at 350 M were included for each set of exposure
 After each exposure, the inserts were transferred from the chamber to a clean well plate, adding 1 mL and 
5 mL of supplemented UltraCULTURE respectively at the basal and apical side for 24 hours of recovery period
 The recovery period was not performed for Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) Assay in live and xCELLigence Real-Time Cell analysis

 After 24 h recovery period, UltraCULTURE medium was removed and exposed cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
 Then, cells were incubated with Neutral Red (NR) dye (
05 g/L in UltraCULTURE) for 3 h at 37 C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere
 Next, other two washes with PBS were done to remove unincorporated dye
 500 l of destain solution (50% ethanol, 49% distilled water, 1% glacial acetic acid; V:V:V) was added to each insert in order to elute incorporated NR from cells by incubation for 10 min at 300 rpm on a plate shaker
 NR extracts were transferred to a 96-well plate in triplicate, in aliquots of 100 l per well
 The optical density of NR extracts was read with a microplate spectrophotometer (Synergy HT, BioTek) at 540 nm using a reference filter of 630 nm
 A blank insert (without cells) was used to assess how much NR solution stains the Transwells NRU levels of treated cells were expressed as a percentage of air-exposed controls

 Tobacco smoke consists of a complex mixture of gaseous and particulate components as a result of the combustion of organic matter
 The cytotoxic effects are particularly relevant on bronchial epithelial cells which are directly exposed to smoke in human lungs
 Different approaches were used to test and quantify these effects (Li, 2016; Putnam et al, )
 The marketing of ENDS like THP and e-cig during the last decade, requires inclusion of new burning cigarettes and no-burning products (Belushkin et al, )
 These assays are important to inform the regulatory bodies about their safety profile
 It is therefore necessary to compare the cytotoxicity induced by ENDS with that induced by tobacco cigarettes and to evaluate the possible reduction of the damage triggered by these novel devices
 One of the most used methods to evaluate cytotoxicity induced by ENDS vapor vs cigarette smoke is NRU assay
  A low cost and easy test for indirect measurement of cell viability
 But this assay, as many other cell viability and toxicity tests, has its own limitations (The National  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 26, 
 ;    Toxicological Methods (NICEATM), )
 In fact, any chemical affecting lysosomes may alter the result of the cell count and viability
 This factor makes the system particularly sensitive to chemicals capable of specifically altering the lysosomal pH and cellular environment with consequent overestimation of the toxic effect
 Considering the acidifying capacity of cigarette smoke, the possibility of altering the result with a pH-sensitive dye cannot be excluded
 Previous reports showed no significant differences between NRU and MTT cytotoxicity evaluations with cigarette smoke and THP vapor (Davis et al, )
  However, different studies concluded that NRU assay was the most sensitive cytotoxicity assay for moderate (3-6 h) and longer (12, 18 and 24 h) exposure times to smoke condensate compared to other cytotoxicity assays such as LDH release, kenacid blue binding, MTT, XTT, acid phosphatase activity, sulforhodamine B binding and resazurin binding (Putnam et al, )
 Unfortunately, these studies, exposed bronchial epithelial cells to condensate smoking extract (CSE), and thus only to the water-soluble components of smoke/vapor, and therefore cannot be considered as reference studies in the toxicological assessment of cigarettes and ENDS
 However, they have raised an important technical issue regarding the gold standard for toxicological evaluations
 Therefore, we compared the standard NRU assay with the MTT assay (i), Annexin V Apoptosis Assay (ii), with an updated version of the NRU assay combined with HCS analysis (iii) and, finally, with a RTCA technology (iv) to evaluate the performance of these tests in the assessment of cigarette smoke and ENDS vapor induced cytotoxicity in a whole smoke/vapor ALI-exposed model of bronchial epithelial cells (H)
 Our results, independently from the test used, showed an overall reduced toxicity in bronchial epithelial cells exposed to ENDS vapor when compared to cigarette smoke exposure
 However, different cytotoxicity results were observed for each assay on the basis of the evaluated cytotoxic mechanism and the peculiarity of each test
 In particular, NRU and MTT results showed that 5 puffs of smoke from 1R6F cigarette were sufficient to adversely affect  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 26, 
 ;    the uptake of dye and the metabolism of H292 bronchial cells
 We also observed a slight significant difference of viable cells with NRU assay and MTT assay (Table A)
 The MTT assay detects a higher percentage of cells survived to the exposure to 1R6F cigarette smoke
 On the other hand, different results were obtained from NRU and MTT assays for H292 cells exposed to vapor of e-cig and THPs (Table A-A)
 Both, MTT and NRU assays did not show any difference between exposures to e-cigarettes and their AIR controls (Table A2, A)
 Similarly, no significant differences between exposures to THPs and AIR control were detected by MTT assay (Figure )
 Our results are consistent with previous studies showing similar results on reduced cytotoxicity of e-cig and THPs compared to cigarette smoke (Davis et al, 2019; Leigh et al, 2018; Sohal et al, )
 We also observed a significant reduction of H292 cell viability between exposures to THPs and their AIR controls by NRU assay (Figure 2), suggesting that this assay is more sensitive compared to MTT for the cytotoxicity The reduction of MTT leads to the formation of insoluble violet-blue formazan product, which are proportional to cell viability
 Therefore, the acidic pH of the medium can modify the absorption spectrum of the cationic formazan altering the outcome of this test and representing an important bias for the interpretation of the results, particularly when it comes to tobacco products known to modify the pH of the medium (Brunnemann & Hoffmann, 1974; Henningfield et al, )
  This aspect has to be considered when interpreting data from MTT assay on the effect of a complex chemical mixture, such as tobacco smoke and ENDS vapor, on cells, both to correctly interpret the result obtained and to evaluate a possible overestimation of viable cells
 The reduction of pH by cigarette smoke on the culture medium could explain the high viability detected by MTT assay compared to NRU assay with 1R6F cigarette smoke, differently from ENDS vapor exposure, particularly for e-cig  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 26, 
 ;    Our results obtained by Annexin V evaluation showed high reduction of viable cells after exposure to 1R6F [Annexin V-PE () and 7AAD ()] compared to NRU and MTT assays with a substantial percentage of cells in advanced apoptosis [Annexin V-PE (+) and 7AAD (+)]
 Comparing the percentage of viable cells obtained by the Annexin V apoptosis assay to that obtained by MTT assay, the result of viable cells by the latter assay is even higher
 MTT is mainly reduced by the coenzyme NAD(P)H and glycolytic enzymes of the endoplasmic reticulum (Berridge et al, )
 Since in cells undergoing early apoptosis coenzyme NAD(P)H and glycolytic enzymes remain intact and able to reduce MTT to formazan, the formation of this colored product in MTT assay could be viewed as a measure of the rate of glycolytic NAD(P)H production
 Hence, a decrease in the concentration of D-glucose, NADH or NADPH in the culture medium may be accompanied by a decrease in MTT-formazan production
 Another reason why the results of viable cells by MTT assay are higher may be due to test product different pH levels affecting the culture medium, to which the NRU assay does not seem to be sensitive
 Our results suggest that for each product the results obtained by Apoptosis Annexin V assay are quite similar in terms of viable cells obtained with the classical NRU assay (Figure 4 and 2) due to the integrity of cell membranes in the early phase of apoptosis
 Finally, effects of chemical mixture contained in smoke/vapor could result in changes in enzymatic activity that could influence the results of NRU and MTT assays (Winikoff et al, )
 Cytotoxicity analysis by all these assays have the limit to detect live/dead cells at a given time (24 hours), without the possibility of understanding how cells behave in a continuum
 Therefore, we also performed an NRU imaging assay, preparing a protocol on live imaging for NRU in lysosomes, then observing the morphological changes and the phenotypic fingerprinting, indicator of metabolically active cells over the time (from 0 to 48 hours), going therefore beyond the determination of cytotoxicity in classical tests

 ;    Finally, the RTCA data are produced and collected during the whole time of running protocol, and hence there is the possibility of assessing the effect of smoke/vapor on cells at any time of the post-exposure time (0 - 48 hours), generating proliferation profiles in one single experiment (Figure )
 By comparing of the results from this technique and the others we observed a strong deviation from the others at 24 hours, in particular for the 1R6F cigarette smoke and for THP vapor exposure
 Despite a good number of viable cells for e-cigs, there is a significant difference between the data obtained for the other products
 The fact that this method mainly detects the ability of cells to attach and proliferate suggest that cells are viable and metabolically active
 However, our results suggest that cells exhibit delayed replication as suggested by low cellular indexes following treatment with cigarette smoke and THP vapor, but not with treatment with e-cig vapor (Figure 6 and Table )
 This data needs to be further investigated to better understand the limitations or benefits of RTCA for the assessment of these products
 RTCA and HCS still have the advantage to generate a time-dependent growth/mortality profile in a single experimental run, differently from other assays
 This is a relevant point allowing to determine and derive the kinetic dependency parameter for effectiveness and potency of smoke/vapor in the cell metabolism
 However, these methods have some limitations related to the costs of the instruments and personnel training for non-routinary methodology
 Increased costs for performing such tests are also depending on those related for buying dedicated disposable parts for imaging and RTCA
 In conclusion, MTT assay applied to the assessment of the cytotoxicity induced by cigarette smoke and ENDS vapors could suffer from potential interference due to the intrinsic nature of these chemical mixtures
 Instead, NRU assay is a more appropriate test for assessing the cytotoxicity induced by these products
 However, it should be combined with a time-resolved  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February 26, 
 ;    test, particularly when studying new products and devices whose kinetics are unknown
 Furthermore, it would be advisable to deepen the results of the NRU assay with a flow cytometric test evaluating apoptosis and necrosis in order to increase toxicological sensitivity
