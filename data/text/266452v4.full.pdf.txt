FDAAA TrialsTracker: A live informatics tool to monitor compliance with FDA requirements to report clinical trial resultsA live informatics tool to monitor compliance with FDA requirements to reportIntroduction: Non-publication of clinical trials results is an ongoing issue
 In 2016 the USgovernment updated the results reporting requirements to ClinicalTrials
gov for trials coveredunder the FDA Amendments Act 
 We set out to develop and deliver an online tool whichpublicly monitors compliance with these reporting requirements, facilitates open public audit, andMethods: We conducted a review of the relevant legislation to extract the requirementson reporting results
 Specific areas of the statutes were operationalized in code based on the resultsof our policy review, publicly available data from ClinicalTrials
gov, and communications withClinicalTrials
gov staff
 We developed methods to identify trials required to report results, usingpublicly available registry data; to incorporate additional relevant information such as key datesand trial sponsors; and to determine when each trial became due
 This data was then used toResults: There were a number of administrative and technical hurdles to successful oper-ationalization of our tracker
 Decisions and assumptions related to overcoming these issues aredetailed along with clarifications directly from ClinicalTrials
 gov
 The FDAAA TrialsTracker wassuccessfully launched in February 2018 and provides users with an overview of results reportingDiscussion: Clinical trials continue to go unreported despite numerous guidelines, com-mitments, and legal frameworks intended to address this issue
 In the absence of formal sanctionsfrom the FDA and others, we argue tools such as ours - providing live data on trial reporting -can improve accountability and performance
 In addition, our service helps sponsors identifytheir own individual trials that have not yet reported results: we therefore offer positive practicalsupport for sponsors who wish to ensure that all their completed trials have reported

 If a trial thatmeets pACT criteria updates to include the new "FDA Regulated Drug/Device" fields, does itmake more sense to switch the assessment of these trials to use the ACT criteria than the pACTcriteria, assuming the above assumption holds true?

Yes, I understand this per my original message
