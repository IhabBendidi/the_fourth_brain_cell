 Wood2, Hong-Bo 2 Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA In order to exert their therapeutic effects, nanoparticles (NPs) often need to travel into the tissues composed of multilayered cells
 Accumulative evidence has revealed the central role of transcellular transport route (entry into one cell, exocytosis, and re-entry into another) in this process
 While NP endocytosis and subcellular transport have been intensively characterized, the exocytosis and re-entry steps are poorly understood, which becomes a barrier to improve NP delivery into complex tissues
 Here, we termed the exocytosis and re-entry steps together as intercellular exchange
 We developed a novel collagen-based 3D cellular assay to specifically monitor and quantify the intercellular exchange events of NPs and distinguish the contributions of several potential mechanisms
 Our results showed that NPs can be exocytosed freely or enclosed inside extracellular vesicles (EVs) for re-entry, while direct cell-cell contact is hardly involved
 EVs account for a significant fraction of NP intercellular exchange, and its importance in NP delivery was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo
 Intriguingly, while freely released NPs engage with the same cellular receptors for re-entry, EV-enclosed ones bypass this dependence
 These studies provide an easy and precise system to investigate the intercellular exchange stage of NP delivery, and shed the first light in the importance of EVs in NP transport (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Due to the tunable physicochemical characteristics and versatile cargo loading properties, nanoparticles (NPs) have great potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases
 One prerequisite for many in vivo applications of NPs is to travel efficiently in the tissue of multilayered cells, and eventually into target cells
 Therefore, understanding the cell biology, especially the transport pathways, is of particular significance to the success of nanomedicine
 Over the years, numerous efforts have been devoted to elucidate how NPs of various types enter the cell and travel inside
 However, fewer studies have focused on another fundamental question: how will these internalized NPs be released from one cell, and transferred to another?  Besides being a fundamental cellular process, this question is also of great relevance to NP translation into the clinics
 Since the first NP-formulated drug (Doxil) was approved in 19959, the rate of NP clinical translation has been limited
 A major challenge has been the poor delivery efficiency into solid organs or tissues composed of multilayered cells
 This problem is best exemplified in solid tumors in which studies have shown that only ~
7% (median) of systemically injected dosage of NPs eventually accumulate in the tumor tissue
 Traditionally, the central paradigm of NP transport into tumors was the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which considered passive diffusion through intercellular gaps as the primary route for extravasation
 Recently, a series of studies showed that the majority of NPs rather extravasate through an active transcellular transport pathway
 Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Sindhwani et al found that tumor endothelium is largely intact without gaps, and NPs mainly reside inside endothelial cells during extravasation
 Using a fixation-based method, the authors also inactivated the active transport process prior to NP administration and observed that this treatment eliminates the majority of NP extravasation and tumor accumulation
 Another line of evidence arises from the studies on a tumor-penetrating peptide, iRGD
 This peptide can actively penetrate across tumor vessels and deeply into the extravascular regions when covalently coupled to various cargo types, ranging from small molecules to NPs
 This process is also energy dependent, and the penetration distance is far beyond the capability of passive diffusion
 It was later shown that iRGD-coupled NPs also reside inside endothelial cells during extravasation
 Together, these results indicate that NPs need to first enter endothelial cells, and then be exported for entering subsequent cells
 This highlights the central role of the active (energy dependent) transcellular route in NP delivery and in vivo applications
 Theoretically, transcellular transport consists of four steps: entry into one cell, intracellular transport, cargo export or exocytosis, and the re-entry of released cargo into a second cell
 While the first two steps of NP transport have been well characterized, the latter two remain largely understudied,
 Here, we term the last two stages (cargo export and re-entry) as intercellular exchange
 Traditional studies on NP transcytosis cover exocytosis but not re-entry7, and so far, there is no assay specifically quantifying this process

 ;    was a need for assays that monitor and quantify the intercellular exchange events of NPs independent of interference from the first two steps of transcellular transport
 We previously developed one such assay, integrating cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) with a novel class of etchable NPs
 Our results showed that a significant number of NPs are transferred from one cell (donor) to another (recipient) in membrane-enclosed structures, which we hypothesized to be either secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) or through direct cell-cell contact
 Here, we adapted this assay into a collagen-based format in three dimensions (3D) to further elucidate the underlying mechanism
 The current format is easy to set up, better mimics the cell growth environment in vivo, and is capable of distinguishing several possible routes for intercellular exchange
 Our results here demonstrated that EVs, but not direct cell-cell contact, serve as the membrane-enclosed conduit for intercellular exchange of NPs
 The EV route accounted for a significant and varying fraction of intercellular exchange, and its importance was proven in vitro and in vivo
 Our study also unveiled differences for freely The intercellular exchange assay was established as below
 First, donor cells were incubated with CPP-functionalized NPs for internalization
 The primary donor cell types included human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and PC-3 (human prostate cancer cell line), as we aim to understand the cargo transfer from endothelium to other cell types, as well as the material exchange between cells beyond the vasculature
 The key to the success of our assay is etchable silver-based NPs (AgNPs)
 In etching, a chemical and nontoxic solution, etchant, is used to rapidly dissolve AgNPs and thus eliminate their fluorescence signals,
 Importantly, etchant cannot permeate lipid membranes, such as cell membranes
 Therefore, etching can remove extracellular and cell surface bound AgNPs, but those internalized remain intact
 By eliminating these noise signals caused by extracellular NPs, etching is particularly useful in improving the quality of cellular and in vivo imaging 
 To facilitate their entry into donor cells, we functionalized AgNPs with two CPPs
 Transactivating transcriptional activator (TAT) is the first and one of the most widely used CPPs to deliver NPs and macromolecules into cells
 RPARPAR is the prototype of a novel class of CPPs, CendR peptides, whose cellular receptor is neuropilin-1 (NRP1) 
 iRGD is a tumor-specific CendR peptide, and NRP1 binding is the basis for its vascular and tumor penetration property ,
 We previously showed that these peptides, while engaging with different cellular receptors, invoke a similar macropinocytosis-like process for cell entry,
 Besides assisting the NP uptake, these CPPs were also used to lead NPs from one cell to another16,27, and may help elucidate the function of ligand-receptor interactions during intercellular exchange
  After CPP-AgNP internalization, donor cells were etched to ensure that AgNPs reside only inside the cells
 Then, these cells were lifted up and mixed with another group of cells, termed recipient cells
 Recipient cells (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    are labeled in a different fluorescence color, so that we can distinguish these two cell types
 After incubation, the cell mixture was dissociated into single cells, and AgNPs in donor and recipient cells were detected and quantified by flow cytometry
 Due to etching, AgNPs in recipient cells can only arise from the exocytosis from donor and then re-entry into recipient cells, thus the intercellular exchange
 In all our studies, donor cells were incubated with CPP-AgNPs and etched in bulk, and then evenly aliquoted into different experimental groups
 This way, we ensure that the entry and subcellular transport status of AgNPs in donor cells are all the same, thus decoupling these two steps from the quantification of intercellular exchange
 Plus, this allows us to simplify the analysis, and directly define the intercellular exchange efficiency as the total AgNPs that can reach The first version of our assay simply cultured the donor/recipient cell mixture in ultra-low binding plates, which is vastly different from the physiological conditions of cell growth
 Here, we adapted it to a 3D format
 Our first approach was utilizing collagen microtissues28, in which we observed little NP transfer (Fig
 S1), and requires sophisticated fabrication procedures to generate
 Then, we encapsulated recipient cells in a collagen matrix on the bottom of the wells in the plate, and seeded CPP-NP-containing donor cells on top of the recipient-collagen layer (Fig
 A)
 PC-3 and PC3-GFP cells were first used as donor and recipient cells, respectively, and TAT-coated AgNPs (T-AgNPs) and RPARPAR-coated AgNPs (R-AgNPs) as the model CPP-NPs for assay optimization
 We observed ~9 % of recipient cells becoming positive for both T-AgNPs and R-AgNPs (Fig
 1B), and the intercellular exchange efficiency was defined accordingly (see Methods)
 Several parameters were further optimized to maximize the intercellular exchange, such as cell number, donor/recipient ratio, and incubation time (Fig
 S)
 The optimal condition is described in the Methods, and used throughout this study
 Interestingly, we observed little difference in the intercellular exchange efficiency when plating donor cells on top either as monolayer or when encapsulated in a separate collagen layer (Fig
 1C and D)
 For simplicity, we used the monolayer format for donor cells in the following experiments
  Extracellular vesicles, but not direct cell-cell contact, mediate the NP exchange between cells  Besides better mimicking the native growth environment, the 3D assay is of unique advantage to distinguish several possible routes for intercellular exchange
 We speculate three possible routes of intercellular exchange: CPP-NPs are exported as free agents (direct release), or are exocytosed into EVs, or are exchanged via direct contact between donor and recipient cells
 For the first route, CPP-NPs are directly exposed to surrounding environment, and will recognize and bind to recipient cells in the same way as donor cells
 Alternatively, CPP-NPs will be protected from etching by lipid membranes in the latter two routes
 Thus, constant etching of donor/recipient mixtures can distinguish the direct release from the other two routes, while it failed to distinguish between EV release and direct cell-cell contact (Fig
 A)
 To solve this problem, an extra collagen gap (no cells) was added between donor and recipient cells to prevent cell-cell contact

 ;    immune-histochemical and immunofluorescence staining on the 3D collagen matrix (Fig
 S3), and confirmed that no cells or cellular structures were seen in the gap region, thus no direct cell-cell contact
 Using etchant and this gap together, we were able to distinguish the contributions from all three routes for intercellular We first quantified the intercellular exchange efficiency of T-AgNPs and R-AgNPs in multiple donor/recipient pairs (Fig
 2 A-D and Fig
 S)
 Constant etching caused a significant reduction of both CPP-AgNPs that can travel from donor to recipient cells, while the reduction range depends on CPP and donor/recipient cell types
 This result suggests that a significant part of CPP-NPs is exported freely by donor cells
 The collagen gap between donor and recipient cells, however, exhibited little effect on the intercellular exchange of NPs, regardless of constant etching
 We made the same observation regardless of the type of CPPs and donor/recipient cells used
 This result indicates that direct cell-cell contact is not required for the etching-resistant intercellular exchange
 Therefore, EVs are the etching-resistant carriers of CPP-NPs from donor to recipient cells
 Based on our results, EVs account for ~30-50% of the total intercellular exchange for CPP-NPs
 We also changed the concentration of collagen in the gap, which showed little effect on the intercellular exchange (Fig
 E)
 AgNPs of different sizes were also used, which revealed a size dependence of intercellular exchange efficiency for T-AgNPs (Fig
 2F) but not for R-AgNPs (Fig
 S)
  EVs are a heterogenous group of secreted vesicles including exosomes and microvesicles 
 EVs have long been recognized as the conduit for intercellular communication and material exchange (e
 g
 nucleic acids, proteins),
 Here, we performed additional experiments to verify the notion that EVs mediate the intercellular exchange of NPs
 First, GW4869 is a compound that blocks ceramide-mediated inward budding of multivesicular bodies and thus prevents the release of EVs, especially exosomes
 After confirming that GW4689 induced no or little cytotoxicity (Fig
 S6), we used it to investigate the effect of inhibiting EV biogenesis on the intercellular exchange
 GW4869 treatment significantly lowered the intercellular exchange of T-AgNPs and R-AgNPs in a concentration dependent manner, and this result was observed with multiple donor/recipient pairs (Fig
 3A, 3B and Fig
 S)
 Besides silver nanoparticles, we found that the intercellular exchange of TAT-conjugated gold nanoparticles (T-AuNPs), which is not etchable, could also be decreased by Second, we isolated EVs secreted by donor cells after CPP-NP internalization and etching
 NP-carrying and NP-free EVs were separated by density gradient ultracentrifugation as previously described
 The AgNP content in these two EV populations was detected based on their fluorescence signal We confirmed that this method can distinguish NP-carrying and NP-free EVs (Fig
 C)
 Next, we set out to investigate whether these AgNPs are inside the EVs
 NP-carrying EVs were treated with etchant and Triton X-100 (TX100), individually (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    or collectively, followed by centrifugation in spin column 10,000 MWCO spin column
 The fluorescence signal of AgNPs was only seen in the top chamber for all conditions except those treated with both etchant and TX100 (Fig
 D)
 This result suggests that etchant alone cannot dissolve the AgNPs protected inside EVs, while TX100 alone, although removing lipids, cannot dissemble the NPs
 Only when treated with both reagents, AgNPs can be exposed to etchant and dissolved, which frees the coupled fluorescence dyes to flow through the column membrane to the bottom chamber
 Overall, these results support the notion that CPP-To confirm the molecular nature of vesicles carrying NPs, we performed western blotting to detect known EV markers
 CD63 and CD9, two common EV markers, were detected in NPs-carrying EVs on the similar level to that in NP-free EVs (Fig
 E)
 Last, we treated CPP-NP-containing donor cells with GW4869, and collected the EVs
 This result showed that GW4869 treatment indeed lowered the amount of total EVs (Fig
 3F) and the fraction of NP-carrying vesicles (Fig
 G)
 On the other hand, we found that the amount of freely released CPP-AgNPs was not affected by GW4869 treatment, indicating that GW4869 effect is specific to EV route (Fig
 H)
  Next, we evaluated the EV-mediated entry efficiency into recipient cells
 EVs from a variety of donor cell types were isolated and labeled with a lipophilic dye
 After normalization based on the protein content, they were incubated with recipient cells in both NP-free and NP-carrying forms
 Our results showed that loaded with NP or not, EVs enter the cells with similar efficiency (Fig
 A)
 We also isolated NP-free EVs from different types of parent cells and tested their cell entry efficiency in a variety of cell types
 The cell entry efficiency of EVs varied, which depends on both parent and recipient cell types (Fig
 B-D)
 Second, we verified the transport rate of EVs in the collagen matrix
 Both NP-free and NP-carrying EVs seemed to rapidly diffuse through the collagen and colocalized with PC3-GFP cells at the bottom of collagen within 30 minutes (Fig
 E)
 This result indicates that collagen gap and matrix allow efficient transport and exchange of EVs
  Lastly, the endocytosis of T-AgNPs and R-AgNPs into cells are mediated by the interaction with their receptors, heparin sulfate (HS) proteoglycans and neuropilin-1 (NRP1), respectively
 Here, we set out to test whether freely released CPP-NPs and NP-carrying EVs enter the recipient cells in the same manner
 Using soluble HS and NRP1-blocking antibody, we were able to reduce the intercellular exchange of T-AgNPs and R-AgNPs, respectively
 This was performed without etching, and the levels of reduction were very similar to that of etching treatment
 In the presence of constant etching, these cell entry inhibitors exhibited little effect (Fig
 4F and G)
 These results demonstrate that these inhibitors can effectively block the re-entry of freely released CPP-NPs into recipient cells, while NP-carrying EVs are resistant to them
 These data support the notion that while freely released CPP-NPs still rely on the same ligand-receptor interaction for cell entry, NP-carrying EVs (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    EV biogenesis is important for NP delivery into solid tumors in vivo Last, we set out to validate the importance of EV biogenesis in NP delivery in vivo
 Here, we used iRGD to functionalize AgNPs, as it was shown that iRGD can induce the vascular and tumor penetration of a variety of NPs, including AgNPs, in vivo,,
 To inhibit EV biogenesis, we intratumorally injected GW4869 into mice bearing 4T1 breast tumor
 The homing study by intravenous injection of iRGD-AgNPs showed that compared to control group, GW4869 treatment exhibited inhibitory effect on the accumulation of iRGD-AgNPs in the whole tumor tissue (Fig
 A)
 We quantified the amount of iRGD-AgNPs in peripheral and center regions of the tumor tissue (Fig
 5B and 5C), which showed that this inhibitory effect was more obvious in the center area of the tumor, which is poorly vascularized, than in highly vascularized peripheral area12 (Fig
 S)
 We also quantified the penetration distance of iRGD-AgNPs from the nearest blood vessel in the poorly vascularized region (Fig
 S10), and found that GW4869 treatment significantly decreased the penetration distance of iRGD-We also validated this observation with an orthotopic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumor model (Fig
 5E-5G and Fig
 S)
 Notably, GW4869 was injected intravenously in this study, to verify whether its effect remains after systemic administration
 A significant reduction of iRGD-AgNP accumulation was also seen in peripheral and center regions of the tumor tissue after GW4869 treatment, as well as the penetration distance from tumor vessels
 Together, these data suggest that EV biogenesis is important for extravasation, and more importantly, the deeper penetration of NPs into the extravascular regions through the transcellular route
  Here we provide a 3D assay to study a very important and yet poorly characterized part of transcellular transport for NPs, intercellular exchange
 Aided by CPPs and etching technology, this assay is easy to establish, better mimics the physiological environment for cells, and is able to distinguish different intercellular exchange routes
 Our results prove that a significant fraction of NPs are exported inside EVs, which carry NPs into recipient cells independent of the original cell-penetrating ligands on them
 Our study unveils a novel role Despite its importance, transcellular transport process is poorly characterized for NPs and other types of macromolecule payloads
 It consists of multiple interconnected steps, which is too complicated to investigate under in vivo conditions
 In vitro, the endocytic machineries in general, and the cell entry and intracellular transport of NPs, are much better understood than exocytosis and intercellular material exchange,,
 Therefore, there is great need to study the intercellular exchange, not only for NP applications but also for a better understanding of exocytosis and intercellular communication in general Years of studies on transcytosis have generated useful cellular assays, such as the transwell assay, to study this process

 ;    transcytosis concerns only one layer of cells, which is not the same with intercellular exchange
 Transwell assays may add an additional layer of cells as recipient, but this format measures the entire process from the entry into the first cell layer to re-entry into recipient cells
 And this type of assays is difficult to ensure no leakage in the intercellular gaps for NPs of various sizes and shapes
 To solely focus on the intercellular The key to our intercellular exchange 3D assay is etching
 After CPP-AgNP internalization, etching ensures that no extracellular or cell surface bound AgNPs exist
 In this way, all AgNPs in recipient cells can only come from the export from donor cells
 The etchant is a small molecule compound that can easily access all extracellular spaces, acts very rapidly (~seconds in vitro) and effectively, and is nontoxic to cells
 Therefore, constant etching can dissolve any freely released AgNPs from donor cells before they can reach the recipient
 Together, etching can help us ensure that we are observing the intercellular exchange events and help distinguish the direct release route from others
 Besides etching, our assay has other advantages
 Bulk processing of donor cell uptake helps eliminate the interference from the cell entry into donor cells and their subcellular transport status
 The collagen gap, meanwhile, is an easy and effective way to prevent direct cell-cell contact
 Together, these properties ensure that we are exclusively and precisely monitor and quantify the intercellular exchange events and enable us to differentiate different transfer routes
 Our results demonstrated that CPP-NPs are exported either freely or enclosed inside EVs, but not exchanged via direct cell-cell contact
 It is very difficult, if not possible, to distinguish these routes in vivo or with existing cellular assays
 Besides AgNPs, we also demonstrated that EVs are important for intercellular exchange of nonetchable NP type The use of CPPs, besides aiding in the cell entry of NPs, help elicit the impact of ligand-receptor interactions on intercellular exchange
 AgNPs are versatile in changing their physicochemical characteristics (e
 g
 sizes, shapes, surface charges), and have been shown to be coupled with a wide variety of cell-penetrating ligands beyond CPPs
 Our results showed that the intercellular exchange efficiency varies with CPP types and AgNP sizes
 Further investigations in this regard will elucidate the impact of various NP properties and formulations on their intercellular exchange efficiency
 This assay format can also be adapted into different matrix compositions and environmental conditions, which may better simulate the path-physiological situations of interest or quantify the impact of these factors on the intercellular exchange
 Finally, the procedure of this 3D assay is simple enough that we can envision to adapt it for high throughput screening
 Such screens may quickly identify genetic factors or chemical compounds that can up- or down-regulate the We have set up this assay to answer a fundamental cell biology question: how NPs are exported from one cell and transferred into another
 In the meantime, we tried to simulate the in vivo scenario
 NP extravasation has been the central focus for its delivery into solid tumors and likely other solid tissues

 ;    HUVEC, a widely used endothelial cell line, as the donor cells
 Plus, extravasation is only the first step for NP delivery, and it is of great scientific and therapeutic significance to understand the intercellular material exchange beyond the vasculatures
 Thus, a wide variety of cell types were also tested here, including tumor cells (PC-3 and 4T1), fibroblasts (3T3) and immune cells (THP-)
 A variation of intercellular exchange efficiency was seen with different cell types in our results, agreeing with previous reports that EV biogenesis and cell uptake are highly cell type specific
 More thorough investigations are needed to elicit the EVs have long been recognized as an important pathway for intercellular communications by exchanging various types of payloads between cells,,,
 Recently, EVs such as exosomes are actively being developed as the carriers for drug delivery
 However, its role in NP transport has received little attention, if any
 Here, our major conclusion is that EVs mediate a significant part of intercellular exchange of CPP-NPs
 We proved that CPP-NPs can be exported inside EVs, and EVs can deliver themselves and the enclosed NPs into another cell
 Using GW4869, we demonstrated that EV biogenesis is important for NP intercellular exchange in vitro, and tissue penetration in vivo
 The in vivo result is particularly intriguing
 To our best knowledge, this is the first evidence in live animals showcasing the importance of EVs in the NP delivery into solid tissues (e
 g
 tumors), and particularly the NP penetration beyond the vasculatures
 The accessibility to the extravascular and/or poorly vascularized regions is of much more significance to improve the therapeutic Lastly, we found that EV-enclosed NPs do not require coupled CPPs for cell entry after the initial uptake by donor cells
 It is reasonable to speculate that as NPs (as well as other cargo) are fully encapsulated and thus their specificity towards recipient cells likely depends on EVs themselves
 The cell uptake specificity of EVs mainly relies on their surface proteins and their interactions with the receptors on recipient cells, which are again highly variable and depend on the donor and recipient cell types, respectively,
 Our study supports this notion in that the cell entry efficiency of EVs varies with parent and recipient cell types, and NP-carrying EVs show no or little difference from NP-free ones
 Overall, our results call for more careful design of ligand-functionalized NPs when aiming at solid organs/tissues like tumors, and highlights the importance of EV biology (surface proteomics, transport dynamics and cell uptake specificity) in improving the tissue penetration (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
