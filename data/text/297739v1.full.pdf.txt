 ;    Background: No regenerative approach has thus far been shown to be effective in skeletal muscle injuries, despite high frequency and associated functional deficits
 We sought to address surgical trauma related muscle injuries using local intraoperative application of allogeneic standardized injury model, because of the high regenerative and immunomodulatory potency Methods: Our pilot phase I/IIa study was prospective, randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled
 Twenty patients undergoing hip arthroplasty via a direct lateral approach were injected with 
0108 or 
5108 PLX-PAD or a placebo into the gluteus medius muscle
  Results: We did not observe any relevant PLX-PAD-related adverse events at the 2-year follow-up
 Improved gluteus medius strength was noted as early as week 6 in the treatment-groups
 Surprisingly, until week 26 the low-dose outperformed the high-dose group and reached significantly improved strength compared to placebo, mirrored by an increase in muscle volume
 Histology indicated accelerated healing after cell therapy
 Biomarker studies revealed that low-dose treatment reduced the surgery-related immunological stress reaction more than high-dose
 Signs of late-onset immune reactivity after high-dose treatment corresponded to reduced Conclusion: Allogeneic PLX-PAD therapy improved strength and volume of injured skeletal muscle with a reasonable safety profile
 Outcomes could be positively correlated with the Funding: The study was funded by the Sponsor, Pluristem Therapeutics, the Israeli innovation authority and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research

 ;    Skeletal muscles are of utmost importance for movement, and they also play a critical role in joint stabilization and trophic support for underlying structures
 Impaired muscle functioning results in reduced strength, a reduced range of motion and joint instability, effects that are all associated with decreased quality of life, enhanced mortality, and socio-economic burden
 Even so, there are no therapeutic options for regenerating injured skeletal muscles
  This problem becomes evident when the muscular abductor apparatus is injured when exposing the hip during total hip arthroplasty (THA)
 (1, 2) Rupture or destruction of the hip abductors can result in limping and predispose the joint to dislocation after THA
 (3, 4) Any following revision substantially increases damage to the periarticular muscles
 (5) Here, we used this highly standardized surgical procedure to assess a novel therapeutic option for muscle Preclinical work by us and other groups has demonstrated that the local injection of autologous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) improves contraction strength after skeletal muscle injury
 (6-8) MSCs do not differentiate into muscle cells but instead act via their secretome
 (9) processes
 Therefore, the immunomodulatory effects of MSC-like cells and their secretion of trophic factors are key to tissue regeneration
 (10) However, immune monitoring in patients that enables characterization of these effects following MSC therapy remains scarce, profile and proliferation properties as MSCs derived from other sources (11) but differ in their reduced ability to differentiate to mesodermal lineages

 This improvement was accompanied by an increased GM volume (P=

 An enhanced contraction force was also noted on the contralateral, non-treated side in the 150M group vs
 the placebo group without increasing volume (Figure B)
 The placebo group exhibited a slight increase in muscle force and volume on both sides over 6 months
 In the high-dose treatment group, we observed an initial superior (treated side) or equivalent (contralateral side) muscle force compared with the low-dose and placebo group at 6 weeks, but with a decline at week 12 (Figure )
 Thereafter, the 300M group increased again but did not exceed the values of the 150M group until the 26th week; this group did not reach statistical significance compared with the placebo group (Figure )

 Interestingly, only high-dose patients developed significant signs of unspecific immune stimulation at week 6 corresponding to their poorer performance in terms of efficacy parameters after this time point

 ;    This study comprises data related to the first successful use of an allogeneic cell therapeutic approach in patients with skeletal muscle injury
 We followed up patients for 2 years after treatment, and we did not observe any serious product-related side effects
 The primary finding of our study was an improvement in muscle strength mirrored by an increase in muscle volume in the cell-therapy groups compared with the placebo group and an inferiority of the high-dose group versus the low-dose group
 Most striking was the concordance of the results gathered from the functional assessments and micro- and macro-morphological studies with the Research of the recent past developed the concept of the immune system as a central player in regenerative processes, triggered by tissue damage

 In our study, histological analysis showed an equal distribution of lymphocytes and macrophages in the muscle biopsies between the groups
 However, the biopsies were taken Of note was a reduced increase in muscle strength after the high-dose treatment between weeks 6 and 12 after an initial larger increase
 This finding could be related to a distinct pattern in biomarker studies
 Only in the high-dose group did we observe signs of late-onset immune activation in peripheral blood at week 6, which might explain the drop in efficacy in this specific dosage between weeks 6 and 
 While the peri-operative rise in IL-10 observed in the placebo group seems typical and is related to a systemic stress reaction triggering IL-10 secretion in the liver (21), the late IL-10 rise observed in the high-dose group (Figure 5E) appears to be instead a result of a counter-regulation to the ongoing inflammation by immune cells themselves

 ;    observation is in agreement with the enhanced frequency of spontaneously IFN-particularly with strong adjuvants, and are known as bystander activation
 (22) The mechanisms behind bystander activation are the release of danger signals in association with cytokines leading to unspecific intra-tissue activation of pre-activated NK- and T-effector cells
 The selected high dose (in the same volume as the low dose, meaning at higher cell concentrations) might have led to critical local conditions for the PLX-PAD cells applied and may be associated with an increased rate of dying PLX-PAD cells that would release danger signals
 Another observation was that low-dose PLX-PAD but fewer high-dose PLX-PAD almost composition and IL-10 release
 The acute stress response immediately after surgery or trauma frequently results in intestinal endotoxin translocation leading to inflammation and protein catabolism that predominantly affects skeletal muscles and results in weight loss and muscle wasting
 (23) The reduction of initial protein catabolism could therefore have contributed to strength and volume advantages after the low-dose treatment over time
 Paralleling the initial changes in functional parameters in the high-dose group, we observed a partial suppression of the initial stress response followed by an unspecific inflammatory reaction after the first postoperative week
 The latter may be reflected in the delayed decrease in muscle strength in Our data suggest that the beneficial effects of regeneration-supporting cells are partially compromised beyond an upper dose threshold
 In our preclinical studies using autologous MSCs, we observed a plateau effect in the dose-response relationship, which also indicates that a larger number of cells does not necessarily imply a better functional outcome

 ;    Another observation was the increase in muscle contraction force after low-dose treatment on the contralateral, non-treated side
 It remains unknown, if this effect was mediated by the secretory effects of PLX-PAD cells or an improvement in neurophysiological control due to the better performance of the treated side, or a combination of both
 The latter mechanism would be supported by the fact that the GM volume did not change on the non-treated side and that cross-educational effects are known to improve contralateral limb strength of the trained side by approximately 50% after unilateral training
 (24) The effect on the contralateral side is not as pronounced as on the treated side, voting for an additional local effect of the cells
 In contrast to myoblast transplantation studies (25-27), our data reveal that the effect of transplanted PLX-PAD cells is not based on differentiation but rather on trophic and immunomodulatory support of the endogenous regeneration
 This finding is consistent with recent studies on tendon healing demonstrating the decisive role of early trophic factor delivery to the site of injury
 (28) Although cells were not labeled in our patients to avoid possible alterations of their biologic potential, preclinical studies had shown that transplanted PLX-PAD cells had been cleared from the host muscle within a few weeks, which highlights the Procedural pain and soft tissue swelling are typical postoperative side effects of hip arthroplasty
 Analyzing their distribution in table S4, it can be seen that in the 150M group 5 patients showed procedural pain in comparison to 3 in the placebo and the high dose 300M group
 We cannot exclude pain as a symptom of the early immunological effect in the 150M group, but considering that only 2 more patients stated pain in the 150M group compared to the other groups and that the 300M group was identical to placebo, we would refrain from an interpretation in this direction
  Procedural swelling could be seen in only 1 more patient in the PLX-PAD groups compared to placebo, which does not allow an interpretation, in our opinion

 Even though a small number of patients has been enrolled, the consistent results in various endpoints makes us confident about the effects further supporting the strength of the data despite low number of patients
 Another weakness is the light sex bias with a skewed distribution between the groups, but even taking into account this bias as confounder, the support of muscle regeneration by PLX cells remains In an injury, which does not comprise the whole muscle, such as the direct lateral approach used as a model in this study, the prize for the high standardization level is the compensation of contraction force within 6 weeks (first time of measurement)
 Patients of the placebo stayed at this functional level despite the new hip joint and an intensive rehabilitation program, which would naturally lead to an increase in force in the trained musculature
 Patients treated with 150 million PLX-PAD showed an increase of contraction force and volumes of gluteus medius muscles compared to the placebo group
 This increase can either be related to an improved healing of the injured muscle part (which in our opinion is the most probable based on previous work with MSCs in preclinical models), or by a hypertrophy or even hyperplasia of the non-injured muscle
 Due to the restrictions of the human model a more exact differentiation was unfortunately not possible
 Since we naturally could not analyze the whole muscle tissue of the patients and had to rely on fine needle biopsies of one circumscribed region of the treated muscle, the data from this analysis has to be interpreted cautiously
 We did not observe an accumulation of immune cells in the treatment groups different from the placebo group and therefore did not find evidence for a compartment shift of the cells
 Since we were analyzing a region that has been treated and was located directly proximal to the injury zone, we would have expected to observe an immune cell infiltration related to the treatment in this area, but, of course, an infiltration in another muscle region not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    cannot be excluded
 Likewise, we cannot exclude that another region of the gluteus medius muscle or even another periarticular muscle would show changes in vessel formation and muscle fiber type changes after treatment, but we did not observe this in the biopsies
 As mentioned before we think that our immunological data may provide an explanation to  why low-dose outperformed high-dose cell therapy
 The central point seems to be the unspecific bystander activation of effector T cells that can migrate easily to inflamed tissue and induce an overwhelming local inflammation, which is not supportive of regeneration
 Unfortunately, we were not allowed to take early biopsies, which could confirm our hypothesis derived from our immunological data
 The week 12 biopsies did not reveal any differences in immune cell infiltration, which only shows that the immunological activation is resolved by endogenous regulation (e
 g
 IL-10) which is also reflected by the recovery of the temporary drop in muscle power increase in the high-dose group at week 
 Promoting skeletal muscle healing is one of the remaining unsolved challenges in orthopedic and trauma surgery; there is a lack of strategies that enable complete regeneration of structure In conclusion, our results demonstrate the safety of placental-expanded mesenchymal-like cells for the treatment of iatrogenic muscle injury in patients and provide preliminary results on the efficacy of this treatment
 Our biomarker studies suggest that immunomodulation has a significant impact on regeneration and mediates at least partly the mode of action

 IGFBP-3 belongs to a family of IGF binding proteins that enhance the half-life of IGF, and was specifically shown to support myoblast differentiation and to correlate with T cells represent the acquired arm of the immune system, and their activation and proliferation is an important part of the inflammatory process
 The effect of PLX-PAD on cell proliferation was assessed in vitro by co-culturing PLX-PAD cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells mitogen
 The results revealed a significant dose dependent decrease in PBMC proliferation (p PLX-PAD were aseptically filled in cryogenic bags at a concentration of 10-20x106 PLX cells/mL in a mixture containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 5% human albumin and plasmalyte and stored in gas phase liquid nitrogen at a temperature lower than -C

 We used a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) set including all treated participants
 All statistical analyses were performed using SAS (Version 
2; Cary, North Carolina, USA)
 We analyzed parameter changes from baseline (day 0) by applying a mixed model for repeated measures
 We analyzed changes in the micro-structural level from baseline until week 12 based on biopsy data using an ANCOVA model
 The statistical tests were two-tailed, and we adopted a The study was approved by the German regulatory authorities (Paul Ehrlich Institute, Vorlage-Nr
