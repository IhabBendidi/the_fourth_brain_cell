 Clinical studies suggest that fragmentation risk is dependent on clot composition
 This current study presents the first experimental characterization of the fracture properties of blood clots, in addition to the development of a predictive model for blood clot fragmentation
 A bespoke experimental test-rig and compact tension specimen fabrication has been developed to measure fracture toughness of thrombus material Fracture tests are performed on three physiologically relevant clot compositions: a high fibrin 5% H clot, a medium fibrin 20% H clot, a low-fibrin 40% H clot
 Fracture toughness is observed to significantly increase with increasing fibrin content, i
 e
 red blood cell-rich clots are more prone to tear during loading compared to the fibrin-rich clots
 Results also reveal that the mechanical behaviour of clot analogues is significantly different in compression and tension
 Finite element cohesive zone modelling of clot fracture experiments show that fibrin fibres become highly aligned in the direction perpendicular to crack propagation, providing a significant toughening mechanism

 ;    Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS), due to embolic occlusion of a cerebral artery, results in over 
5 million deaths each year []
 Intra-arterial Mechanical Thrombectomy (MT) is a minimally invasive procedure for treatment of AIS in which the obstructing thrombus is removed using a stent-retriever and/or an aspiration catheter
 Based on the recent clinical studies [2,3,1216,411] the proportion of patients experiencing successful procedural revascularization (TICI >=2b) ranged from 76% [17] to 
4% [18] after all procedures
 Although complete revascularization (TICI =3) is achieved in less than 61% of cases [19], and it often takes multiple attempts to remove the complete thrombus
 Many investigators attempt to improve interaction between thrombectomy devices and thrombus thrombectomy devices, distal embolism due to clot fragmentation remains a significant challenge for MT procedures
 In general, all endovascular MT techniques and devices carry a significant risk of thrombus fragmentation and subsequent distal emboli with associated adverse clinical outcomes Clinical data suggest that thrombus fragmentation and consequent distal emboli are related to thrombus composition
 From histological analysis of thrombi retrieved from 85 AIS patients, Kaesmacher et al  [20] found a higher fraction of RBC in patients with multiple embolizations resulting from periprocedural thrombus fragmentation
 Gengfan et al [24] found that higher thrombus density in nonenhanced computed tomography, associated with higher fraction of RBC, is an independent predictor for secondary embolism
 In contrast, Sporns et al concluded that secondary embolism is more probable for clot with lower RBC content []
 Moreover, per-pass analysis of AIS thrombi show that the composition of thrombus fragments retrieved with each pass of a device during MT are different, further supporting the dependence of clot fragmentation on Previous studies have investigated clot hyperelastic and viscoelastic behaviour using compression testing [2730] and tensile testing [,]
 However, no study to date has investigated the fracture properties of blood clots
 The characterisation of fracture toughness of blood clots has the potential to guide the design of improved next-generation MT devices and to inform clinical strategies

 ;    The objective of the current study is to provide the first characterization of composition-dependent fracture behaviour of blood clot
 A bespoke experimental procedure for fabrication and fracture testing of compact tension blood clot specimens is developed
 Based on histological studies of the composition of clots removed from stroke patients by MT [3539], tests are performed on three different clot analogue fracture specimen compositions, ranging from high red blood cell (RBC)/low-fibrin clots to low RBC/high-fibrin clots
 In addition to experimental fracture testing of blood clots, finite element cohesive zone fracture models are developed to simulate experimental tests and determine fracture strength and fracture toughness as a function of clot composition
 Furthermore, alignment of the network of fibrin fibres provides a toughening mechanism in blood clots
 This provides a mechanistic explanation for the observed dependence of clot fracture toughness on Developing a reliable test method that is suitable to test the broad range of clot types and compositions can be challenging due to the fragile nature of the clot material The issue is even more critical when the sample is under loading modes that lead to material stretching, such as fracture testing
 Such tests, in contrast to standard compression tests, require gripping of a fragile and slippery material Another issue for fracture testing of blood clots arises from the high ratio of toughness to strength of clot, resulting in the significant deformation prior to fracture initiation
 Finally, consistent fracture testing requires samples that have dimensions far larger than the dimensions of excised AIS clots
 Therefore, careful design considerations are required for test specimen fabrication and test-rig design
 In this section we outline the development of a novel and Thrombus material from human sources cannot be readily fabricated into a repeatable specimen geometry for mechanical and fracture testing
 Therefore, techniques have been developed to fabricate clinically relevant thrombus analogues in vivo []
 Clot analogue samples produced from ovine blood have been found to be histologically similar to human clots []

 ;    of a similar composition [41], and are commonly used for pre-clinical testing of thrombectomy The current study uses an established method to fabricate clot analogues using fresh ovine blood [,]
 Citrated  whole blood was used to form platelet-contracted blood clots within 5 hours of blood collection from the donor animals
 Three different clot analogues types were fabricated from blood mixtures with 5%, 20% and 40% haematocrit (H)
 After separation of platelet rich plasma and red blood cell fractions, blood clot mixtures of the desired haematocrit were created
 These mixtures were placed in a cylindrical container where the  blood mixtures were clotted by adding calcium chloride to reverse the citrate
  Finally, the clots were allowed to mature overnight to create flat, disc-shaped clots with a diameter of between 40 and 90mm and thickness of 6 to mm
 It has previously been established that a decrease in the RBC content of blood clots results in an increase Test samples were prepared the day after formation by cutting the clots into a rectangular shape with two holes for the purpose of gripping using bespoke stainless-steel punches, (Figure a)
 Firstly, a rectangular sharp punch was used to cut 25x24 mm specimens from the discs of clot (step )
 Another punch was used for making two holes in the rectangle specimen (step )
 A specific design was used for this punch such that it can be fitted on top of the rectangle punch,  thereby allowing the precise positioning of the two holes
 A bespoke constraining fixture was designed to fit on top of the clot sample, and to allow making notch of the exact size in the desired location in a repeatable way (step )
 A sharp razor blade of 250 m thickness is used to make a sharp crack in the specimen
 Notched specimen with the crack length of  as well as the unnotched specimens were prepared (n A bespoke test-rig was developed to perform fracture testing of the prepared samples
 A schematic of the designed fracture test rig and each component is shown in Figure c
 A specific design has been considered for top grip and the pin which connected the clot samples to the grip to minimize the variation of the hydrostatic force and surface tension force during the test
 This is a key consideration for this test and any other test which is performed in a fluid medium, especially for the material with relatively low level of force such as clot material and soft biological tissues
 The profile area of the top grip was minimised in order to reduce hydrostatic forces that result from submerging the component in a water bath
 A hollow bar was designed for the top pin, rather than a solid bar, to minimize the variation of the hydrostatic force during the test

 ;    checks reveal that changes in hydrostatic forces due to upwards movement of the top-gripping fixture are approximately two orders of magnitude lower than the force required to cause fracture  (Figure e)
 A finite element rig-design analysis is also performed to ensure that the strength of the top pin provides sufficient mechanical strength during the fracture test
 The results as shown in (Figure 1f) reveal that the maximum von-Mises stress in the pin (
187 MPa) is much lower than the yield strength of the pin (~210 MPa)
 A locking fixture is designed to facilitate insertion of the sample into the test rig without inducing pre-test sample damage (Figure c)
 Two locking plates were connected to the top and bottom grips, through the fabricated pins on the grips and prevented any relative movement of grips before test
 This design feature is crucial for successful testing of fragile blood clot compositions
 Moreover, a slider mechanism is designed for ease of attachment/detachment of the lower grip to the bottom of the water bath without damage to the test specimen
 Both bottom grip and its mate component were fabricated from polylactic acid (PLA) A schematic of the steps for putting the prepared test specimen into the designed test rig is shown in Figure g
 Stainless steel bars were placed through the holes of the sample and attached to top and bottom gripping components (step )
 Next, a locking fixture, including two steel locking plates and the pins fabricated on the griping components, was used to prevent the relative movement of the gripping components (step )
 This locking fixture allows confident handling and putting the prepared clot specimen into the test rig without tearing the clot before the test
 The prepared samples were then put into a customized experimental setup and fracture tests were performed to determine the mechanical and fracture behaviour of the clot analogue samples
 The bottom gripping component slides into an engineered mate component which is glued to the bottom of the water bath (step )
 The top gripping fixture is attached to the mechanical uniaxial Zwick test machine (Zwick Z
5, Ulm Germany) (step )
 The locking plates are then detached from the gripping components (step 5) and the top grip is moved upwards at a velocity of 10 mm/min and the resultant reaction force is measured throughout the fracture test using a 10 N Zwick load cell (step )
 All tests are carried out in fully hydrated conditions by fully submerging the test specimen and test-rig in a water bath filled with phosphate- buffered saline solution at room temperature (~20 oC)

 (g) Schematic representation of steps for putting the prepared test specimens into the The choice of specimen dimensions for fracture testing is constrained by the requirement that the initial crack length must be sufficiently large to ensure that crack propagation occurs before the tensile strength is reached in the material []
 Moreover, the length of the remaining ligament (=W- a) has to be large enough to avoid excessive inelastic deformation in the ligament
 There is also a size limit on the thickness of the specimen (t) in relation to the establishment of plane strain or plane stress conditions
 More discussion on the specimen thickness is provided in Appendix A
  Consequently, large specimens are required for materials with high toughness to strength ratios
 This presents a considerable challenge for fracture testing of biological material/soft tissue specimens, where high toughness occurs due to the fibrous nature of the material, yet fabrication of suitably large specimens may not be possible due to the geometric constraints inherent in the natural anatomy of the material In the current study, we overcome this challenge by using clot analogue materials (rather than excised clots) fabricate large clot analogue samples in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of fracture testing []
 The so-called critical distance 2 ), has been used for estimation of the crack length, where  is fracture toughness,  is material stiffness, and  is ultimate strength []
 The crack length  should be in the same order of magnitude as  (a larger value of crack length is preferred) to make sure that the crack reaches to the propagation condition before the stress in the specimen reach to the ultimate Other dimensions of the clot specimen have been chosen based on the length of crack as shown in Figure b
 It should be noted that the fracture toughness () of blood clots has not been reported previously
 Therefore we approximate the value of  for blood clot before the test, based on the value of fracture toughness for soft tissues []

 ;    after finishing fracture tests and we found the crack length to be large enough for all three compositions used in this study
 Moreover, the clot shows non-linear material behaviour with non-constant stiffness [,]
 Therefore an approximate values of  = 140,130, 100 , which are the values of clot stiffness at 75% strain in unconfined compression test, have been used for 5% H, 20% H, and 40% H clots, respectively
 In addition, the value of  = 
2  has been taken from Furthermore, we performed a second validity check for the measured fracture toughness
 The condition  Fmax/FQ < 
1 should be maintained for a valid fracture test, where Fmax is the ratio of the maximum load that the specimen was able to sustain during the test []
 A summary of the validity checks we have done for our fracture test are presented in Table 1 for each clot composition
 Table 1: Validity checks for the fracture test of 5% H, 20% H, and 40% H platelet-contracted clot Given the aforementioned size limitations the chosen dimensions for the clot specimen are presented in Table 2 to make sure that the sample is as large as required but also as small as possible
 It should be noted that the same dimensions are used for all three compositions, with the exception the specimen thickness dimension, t
 However, for all cases, the thickness is large enough to ensure plain strain condition behind the crack tip
 More details on the effect of specimen thickness are Table 2: Dimensions of the compact tension clot specimen for fracture test (Figure d)

 ;    Fracture toughness which describes the ability of a material to resist the propagation of pre-existing cracks is defined by a parameter   which is the energy needed for crack propagation
 The critical strain energy release rate at fracture initiation point,  , is calculated form experimental data of fracture test based on the established method for fracture toughness calculation of materials []
 The method requires determination of the energy derived from integration of the load versus load-point displacement curve in fracture test, while making a correction for the energy which does not contribute to the creation of new surfaces, such as friction losses  due to the relative motion of pins and clot
 This correction is performed by performing test with an unnotched specimen of the same clot type and subtracting the corresponding energy from that of the notched specimen test (Figure )
 First, the value of a force FQ is found using the 5% secant method as demonstrated in Figure a
 The area under force-displacement curve up to the point of FQ is then calculated which is the energy 
 Corrected energy U is then calculated as  = 1 2, where 2 is the area under force-displacement curve of the unnotched specimen test up to the point with force FQ
 The value of   where the energy-calibration factor  is a geometry function depends on the crack length to width ratio (a/w)

 ;    In order to further characterise the non-fracture biomechanical behaviour of the clot analogue materials, unconfined compression testing is performed using a protocol recently developed by Johnson et al []
 In summary, test specimens were prepared by cutting the clots into cylindrical-shaped samples with an approximate diameter of 10 mm, and an approximate height of 5 mm
 The testing was performed using a Zwick uniaxial tensile machine (Zwick Z
5, Ulm Germany) with a customised aluminium compression platen
 The clot specimens were loaded to a compressive nominal strain of 80% at a constant axial strain-rate magnitude of 10% per second
 In order to obtain detailed insights from the fracture tests described above, finite element simulations are performed in which crack initiation and propagation are predicted using a cohesive zone model
 The clot material is modelled as an anisotropic hyperplastic fibrous soft tissue using the a recently proposed formulation [49]  This formulation has been shown to accurately predict the isochoric and volumetric behaviour of blood clots over a wide range of clot compositions while facilitating control of unphysical auxetic behaviour []

 Stress-strain relationships are readily derived from The constitutive parameters for each clot composition are obtained using an inverse finite element parameter identification scheme and least-square optimization algorithm based on the fracture and compression test data
 These calibrated material parameters are used for all computational In 1968, Rice introduced an energetically motivated generalized crack driving force referred to as the  J-integral []
 The crack will grow upon reaching the J-integral to a critical value JC
 Here, J-integrals for each of the three tested clot compositions are calculated by using the virtual crack extension method in Abaqus (2018, Dassault Syst`emes Simulia Corp
 )
 The computed value of J-integral during the fracture test is then compared to the critical value of the strain energy release rate (GIC=Jc) obtained from the fracture experiment

 The pins were modelled as rigid surfaces and a frictionless contact between the pins and the clot specimen has been considered
  The results of fracture and compression tests for 5%H, 20%H, and 40%H platelet-contracted clot analogues are presented in Figure 
 In general, it is observed that the clot with higher fibrin content are stiffer than the clot with lower fibrin content, both in compression and compact tension test of un-notched specimens
 The force-displacement curves of the compact tension fracture test (Figure 3c) exhibit an initial non-linear stiffening followed by stable crack propagation with an approximately constant force
 The steady-state force is significantly higher with increasing fibrin content (decreasing haematocrit)

 The 40% H clot has the lowest initial stiffness, compared to the 20% H and 5% H clots (Figure e,f)
 It is also observed that the crack propagation starts at a higher value of applied deformation (u) for the fibrin-rich clots compared to the RBC-rich clots (Figure g)
 The applied displacement at the final fracture point () is also higher for 5% H clots compared to the 20% H and 40% H clots
 However, the difference in  for 20% H and 40% H clots is not statistically significant (Figure 3i), whereas a statistically significant difference is observed between all clot compositions in terms of the force at fracture initiation ((/))

 ;    tension test data and the best-fit parameters are presented in Table 
 The ability of the calibrated constitutive law to predict the mechanical behaviour of different clot types is also demonstrated in Figure 5 where a good agreement between experimental data and model predictions is observed for all clot types
 Importantly, if the clot is modelled as an isotropic hyperelastic material a reasonable fit can be obtained for unconfined compression experiments but not for compact tension experiments
 However, when an anisotropic component (equation (5)) is incorporated to represent the fibrin network, a reasonable fit can be computed for both unconfined compression experiments and compact tension experiments
 This highlights the significant contribution of fibrin alignment and stretching when blood clots are subjected to tensile loading
 The anisotropic fibrin component is included in all subsequent simulations in this paper
 Furthermore, in appendix B, we have shown that an Ogden hyperelastic model with asymmetric behaviour is not able to capture the experimental results of the unconfined compression test and compact tension test at the same time

 The 5% H clot has the greatest fracture initiation displacement (ufi), followed by the 20% H clot, with the 40% H clot This computational prediction is in agreement with the experimental observations in Figure g

 ;    (,peak) is higher behind the crack-tip compared to points farther from the crack (Figure d)
 The results in Figure 6 can explain the toughness enhancement in blood clots
 It is noted that the fibres are isotropically distributed at the undeformed reference configuration, and they become aligned as the material deforms and stretches in front of the crack tip
 For further investigation on the contribution of fibrin fibres into the fracture resistance of blood clot, we consider two different models: an anisotropic constitutive model which incorporate the contribution of fibrin fibres (model I) and a non-fibrous isotropic model (model II)
 The hyperelastic parameters of Table 3 are used for model I and the parameters of model II are identified such that both models have the same stress-strain behaviour in uniaxial tension (Figure e)
 The results as demonstrated in Figure 6e reveal the key role of fibrin fibres in  fracture resistance of blood clots
 Notably, much more deformation is required to reach GIC when the contribution of the fibres are considered (mode I), compared to the model II which does not incorporate the contribution of the fibres
 Also, the difference between model I and model II are higher for the 5% H clot with high amount of fibrin compared to the 40%  H clot with lower fibrin content

 The results of which are highly relevant for assessment of clot fragmentation in thrombectomy, a major risk during endovascular treatment of AIS
 A bespoke experimental test-rig and compact tension specimen fabrication has been developed to measure fracture toughness of thrombus material Fracture tests have been performed on three physiologically relevant clot compositions: a high fibrin 5% H clot, a medium fibrin 20% H clot, a low-fibrin 40% H clot
 Fracture toughness is observed to significantly increase with increasing fibrin content, i
 e
 RBC-rich clots are more prone to tear during loading compared to the fibrin-rich clots
 This observation is consistent with the published clinical data which report high RBC-content clots in patients with multiple  Finite element cohesive zone simulations of fracture tests are performed to further investigate the toughening mechanism associated with the clots fibrin network
 Simulations reveal that, with increasing applied displacement, fibrin fibres behind the crack tip reoriented toward the tension direction, becoming highly aligned perpendicular to the crack direction
 This significantly increases the computed J-integral at the point-of fracture initiation
 Furthermore, our investigation reveals that the anisotropic hyperelastic contribution of the fibrin network must be incorporated into a computational model in order to accurately simulate experimental behaviour in both tension and compression
 In contrast, an isotropic hyperelastic formulation does not capture both compressive and tensile behaviour
 This insight into the material model is an advance on our previous isotropic models [27,28], which were proposed based on only considering compression experiments
 Also, the CZM modelling and J-integral analysis have only been used for a limited number of studies of biological soft tissues [52,53], and have not been used for blood clots before
 The developed computational model provides a suitable basis for pre-clinical assessment of the stent-retriever In the current study, we have investigated the influence of clot composition (fibrin and RBC) on the fracture toughness of platelet-contracted clot analogues for three compositions
 There are many other compositions/contractility levels that should be considered in future studies
 Moreover, the influence of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) on fracture toughness of clot should be considered in future experiments
 Using rtPA as an early reperfusion therapy for AIS is recommended by American Heart Association and American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) to reduce or prevent brain infarction

 ;    The critical strain energy release rate (GIC) of an specimen depends on the thickness of the specimen []
 What is referred to as the fracture toughness is the value of the critical strain energy release rate for the specimen which is thick enough to ensure the establishment of plane strain condition at the crack tip
 To investigate the influence of specimen thickness on the fracture test results, we performed a series of CZM simulations for clot of different thickness
 The results, as shown in Figure A1, reveal  that the thickness of the tested samples (Table 2) are high enough for a valid fracture Figure A1: Influence of specimen thickness on the fracture test results for a 5% H clot analogues
