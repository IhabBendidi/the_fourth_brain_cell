 ;    Excessive  aggressive  behavior  is  highly  prevalent  in  patients  with  Autism  SpectrumDisorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disabilities (ID)
 It presents a major obstacle to patient care andtreatment
 Additionally, it often presents as severe self-injurious behavior that may culminate withthe need for chronic restraining of patients, substantially reducing quality of life,
 The primarytreatment for excessive aggressive behavior involves the use of behavioral therapy and medicationsthat act mainly on dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems,
 When patients fail to respond toconventional behavioral and medical treatments, high dose mono- or polypharmacy strategies areindicated
 Although these therapies are successful in most patients, there is a significant subset ofindividuals (approximately 30%) who do not adequately respond to treatment and are consideredStructures  related  to  the  control  of  aggressive  behavior  include  the  prefrontal  cortex,amygdala,  hypothalamus  and  midbrain  periaqueductal  gray
  It  is  believed  that  aggressiveindividuals have alterations in these structures
 Prior research suggests that higher limbic systemactivity alters perception of provocative stimuli, and reduces top-down control of the prefrontalcortex, minimizing the ability to suppress aggressive behavior
 Lesion studies performed in the late18th and  early  19th centuries  have  shown  that  the  removal  of  the  temporal  lobes  or  selectiveamygdala ablation resulted in marked reduction of aggressive behavior in humans911 and nonhumanprimates,
 Imaging studies have been largely controversial and/or inconclusive in asserting anassociation between amygdala volume14 or activity15 and behavioral disorders (including aggressivebehavior)
 For  example,  veterans  with  aggressive  behavior  disorders  have  been  shown  todemonstrate  a  more  intense  amygdala  response  to  external  stimuli  as  well  as  an  attenuatedamygdala-prefrontal  cortex  connectivity,
  In  contrast,  studies  in  criminal  psychopaths  havecertified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 Summary of GOrilla and GEAS gene enrichment analysisStereotactic surgery led to a remarkable reduction in aggressive behavior and improvementsin  quality  of  life  in  patients  with  medically-refractory  aggressive  behavior
  To assess  potentialtherapeutic mechanisms for the procedure, MRI images acquired before and after the surgery wereanalyzed using DBM, and FA and MD maps computed
  While the DBM technique uses imageregistration to calculate local deformation fields at a voxel level for the detection of morphologicalvariations25,  FA and MD values  are  indicative  of  local  microstructural  characteristics  primarilyrelated to white matter

 ;    as fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination, while MD shows the degree of displacement ofWe found  that  morphological  changes  associated  with  reduction  in  aggressive  behaviorcould be grouped into two clusters: Cluster 1 includes areas associated with aggressive behaviorsuch as the DLPFC, NAcc, BNST, Insula, periaqueductal gray (PAG), and dorsal raphe nucleus(DRN)
 Cluster 2 regions includes areas related to somatosensation and pain perception, such assomatosensory  cortex,  thalamus,  and  anterior  Cingulate  Cortex
  The  correlation  of  volumetricchanges with DWI measures suggests that the volume change following surgery is related to localmicrostructural  changes
  Though  the  exact  mechanism  driving  these  distinct  changes  remainsunexplained (e
 g
 increase/decrease of number of glial cells, hypo- or hypertrophy of neurons), it isinteresting to note the clusters change in opposite directions
 Areas of cluster 1 receive alert signalsfrom the presumably hyperactive amygdala8 and decrease in volume once the amygdala stimulationceases
 Whereas, activity in the regions of cluster 2 are suppressed when the amygdala is highlyactivated and increase in volume post-surgery
 The distinct pattern of local changes throughout thesomatosensory/pain network is particularly intriguing in this group and may explain the reduction inself-aggressive behavior  observed after  surgery (OAS self-injury subscale change:  p01:  4 to  ;p02:1 to 0; p03: 4 to 0; p04: 4 to )
 It is known that the amygdala has a central role in processingnociceptive27 stimuli and that patients with self-injurious behavior have altered pain perceptior
Thus, amygdala ablation could affect this neurocircuitry, restoring normal activity in areas related tothe process of nociceptive stimuli resulting in reduction of self-injury behavior
The correlation found between aggressive behavior and agitation supports the theory thatexcessive aggressive behavior occurs when the amygdala is hyper-activated and more responsive toenvironmental stimuli
 In fact, after surgery, patients were able to return to a special needs schoolthat  they  were  previously  forced  to  withdraw  from  when  their  condition  had  progressivelyworsened
 There they are able to learn and improve skills, mainly related to daily life activitycertified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 ;    and  communication
  In  this  sense,  the  procedure  appears  to  leads  to  significant  behavioralimprovement which enables patients to function in a social construct that fosters further behavioralimprovement
  Although  permanent  side  effects  and  worsened  behavioral  problems  have  beenpreviously reported9,11,19, an important aspect of our study was that no noticeable side effects wereThe gene ontology analysis  found that Cluster 1 regions are related to steroid metabolicprocess,  response  to  Nitric  oxide  and  Amphetamine,  aminergic  neurotransmitter  transport,  andinterestingly, regulation of grooming behavior
 These all are closely related to the amygdala andaggressive behavior: Grooming behavior is similar to aggressive behaviors in the sense that it is aninnate social behavior influenced by the amygdala, which plays an important role in social bondingand  the  maintenance  of  species
  The  aminergic  neurotransmitter  system  (e
 g
  serotonin  anddopamine) as well as nitric oxide and amphetamine have all been implicated in the modulation ofaggressive  behavio5,30,31The  mechanism  for  this  effect,  however,  is  still  unknown
  Steroidmetabolism is  a  process  linked  to  aggressive  behavior  and  is  influenced  by  the  amygdala  viaextensive  bi-directional  projections  to  and  from  the  hypothalamus
  This  latter  structure  isresponsible for controlling hormonal production and secretion including precursors of the synthesisof  testosterone  and  cortisol
  These  two  hormones  are  part  of  internal  feedback  loops  of  theamygdala  resulting  in  the  expression  of  more  aggressive  actions  (consequence  of  testosteroneaugmentation) or increased fear responses (consequence of cortisol predominance)
 It is believedthat the ratio between those two hormones may be a biomarker for aggressive behavior
 In fact,this is reinforced by the correlation found between testosterone and the testosterone/cortisol ratioTo our knowledge, this is the first report of longitudinal neuroimaging analyses of patientstreated with bilateral amygdala radiofrequency ablation

 ;    structural alterations that accompany the behavioral changes
 We observed consistent characteristicchanges within our patients and we believe that this analysis better elucidates the whole humanneurocircuitry of aggressive behavior and provides new insights for future interventions
 All thechanges result in striking behavior alterations leading to easing of suffering and improvement inquality  of  life
  The  changes  essential  and  necessary  for  the  positive  outcome  are  yet  to  beelucidated
 Expounding these connections through future research could be instrumental in derivinga better understanding this complex neurocircuitry as well as its mechanism in modulating behavior
Our results, however, suggest an interesting starting point to investigate possible new targets forintervention
 For example, one could propose the use of non-invasive neuromodulatory techniques(e
 g
  Transcranial  Magnetic  Stimulation  (TMS),  Transcranial  direct  current  stimulation  (tDCS))delivered  to  somatosensory cortical  areas  or  DBS to  the  NAcc or  BNST,  for  the  treatment  ofpatients  with  excessive  aggressive  behavior
  Furthermore,  these  results  highlight  the  need  forstudies to ascertain the cause of morphological changes, identify the population of neurons beingaffected, and explore the impact of these changes on neurotransmitter systems, especially in theIn summary, our results provide novel evidence that bilateral amygdala ablation induces re-adaptation of the neurocircuitry that controls aggressive behavior, with a concomitant behavioralphenotype
 These morphological changes could be integral to the reduction of aggressive behaviorand increase in quality of life observed in our study population

 For the remaining analysis, amygdala lesion and area of the probeentry were excluded
 T1-weighted images were non-uniformity corrected and skull-stripped
 Tocapture changes in local brain morphology, we used DBM, a technique based on image registration
Image registration produces transformations that map every point in one image to its correspondingpoint in another image
 Thus, it allows for detection and quantification of anatomic differences
 Inthis  sense,  longitudinal  changes  were  evaluated  by  DBM  using  the  ANTs  toolkitlinear registration in a 2 level registration procedure where we first registered all images of thesame subject to one another to detect within subject changes occurring over time  the criticalIn a second registration, we registered the subject averages to one another to achieve voxelcorrespondence  to  compare  the  local  individual  changes  across  the  group  of  subjects
  Localvolumetric changes of each voxel within each image are captured in the Jacobian of the deformationfrom the image registration, and have been shown to be sensitive to anatomical changes within thebrain without requiring a priori  segmentation
  Especially within-subject longitudinal DBM hasbeen shown to be capable of detecting small local brain changes
