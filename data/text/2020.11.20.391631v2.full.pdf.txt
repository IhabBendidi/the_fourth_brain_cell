 ;    While mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are an appealing therapeutic option for a range of clinical 36 applications, their potential to induce clotting when used systemically remains a safety concern, 37 particularly in hypercoagulable conditions, such as in patients with severe COVID-19, trauma, or cancers
 38 Here, we tested a novel ex vivo approach aimed at improving the safety of MSC systemic administration 39 by use of a bioreactor
 In this device, MSCs are seeded on the outside of a hollow-fiber filter, 40 sequestering them behind a hemocompatible membrane, while still maintaining cross talk with blood 41 cells and circulating signaling molecules
 The potential for these bioreactor MSCs to induce clots in 42 coagulable plasma was compared against free MSCs, as a model of systemic administration, which 43 were directly injected into the circuit
 Our results showed that physical isolation of the MSCs via a 44 bioreactor extends the time necessary for clot formation to occur when compared to free MSCs
 45 Measurement of cell surface data indicates the presence of known clot inducing factors, namely tissue 46 factor and phosphatidylserine
 Results also showed that recovering cells and flushing the bioreactor 47 prior to use further prolonged clot formation time
 Further, application of this technology in two in vivo 48 models did not require additional heparin to maintain target ACT levels relative to the acellular device
 49 Taken together, the use of hollow fiber filters to house MSCs, if adopted clinically, could offer a novel 50 method to control systemic MSC exposure and prolong clot formation time
  51 Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are potent immunoregulators with strong preclinical data that 53 support their application in a wide range of clinical conditions [-]
 MSCs can provide therapeutic 54 benefit to patients suffering from systemic inflammation by effectively immunomodulating peripheral 55 blood cells to reduce inflammatory signaling and promote homeostasis
 Significant evidence of these 56 MSC derived effects have been shown in vitro, in animal models, and in clinical trials, including recently 57 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    under an emergency IND application or expanded access protocol with COVID-19 infected patients [5-58 ]
 However, it is known that under certain conditions MSCs may be pro-coagulable and promote 59 instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR), likely through the expression of known 60 coagulation factors on their cell surfaces and in the production of cellular microvesicles [-]
 Two 61 such factors, tissue factor and phosphatidylserine are known to be integral in physiological coagulation 62 [-]
 Phosphatidylserine is a major component of cell-based coagulation, enhancing coagulation 63 activity through the charge-based binding of coagulation factor zymogens and cofactors to increase 64 formation of the tenase and prothrombinase complexes [-]
 This binding effectively enhances clot 65 formation potential, exacerbating a response when a physiological trigger of coagulation, such as tissue 66 factor, is present [18, 21, ]
 When MSCs are introduced into systemic circulation they bring with them 67 the tissue factor expressed on their cell surface
 MSCs sourced from different donors and locations 68 (bone marrow, BM-MSCs, adipose-derived, AD-MSCs, umbilical cord, UC-MSCs) vary in tissue factor 69 expression, with higher levels of tissue factor correlating with quicker clot formation and IBMR
 BM-70 MSCs, the most commonly used, have been widely shown to have the least tissue factor expression [16, 71 Reducing potential MSC driven clot formation has been a major focus for both academic and clinical 73 groups over the last decade
 Advances have been made to mitigate these risks including changing the 74 MSC mode of delivery away from systemic exposure via intravenous (IV) infusion towards localized 75 injection
 However, in some cases, systemic IV infusions could provide the highest therapeutic potential 76 Minimizing clot formation potential could improve therapeutic efficacy, and also increase safety of the 77 treatment in hypercoagulable patients such as patients with COVID-19 in the ICU [-]
 To that end, 78 increasingly rigorous release criteria during MSC clinical manufacturing are now being applied
 Cell 79 populations with low tissue factor are being selected and fresh or recovered MSCs with lower surface 80 phosphatidylserine exposure are preferred [17, ]

 ;    evaluated, including shifting delivery of the MSCs from intravenous to intramuscular administration, 82 emphasizing higher cell viability, or even using gene modification to promote cell survival [-]
  83 We propose an alternative approach which would minimize direct exposure of the MSCs to blood and 84 contain MSCs in one location
 We utilized a recently described perfusion platform that incorporates a 85 hollow-fiber filter into a fluid circuit to compartmentalize the MSCs, while still allowing exchange of 86 signaling molecules from perfusate to cells, and vice-versa []
 MSCs within this platform were shown 87 to effectively retain their immunomodulatory capacity and alter perfused lymphocyte proliferation, 88 activation, and cytokine production in an MSC dose and duration exposure dependent manner, despite 89 Benchtop coagulation assays, including microfluidic setups, are becoming increasingly translationally 91 relevant[]
 Here, we used a MSC bioreactor platform to assay whether limiting the direct exposure of 92 fresh frozen pooled plasma from healthy patients to MSCs, and therefore the available tissue factor and 93 phosphatidylserine of the MSCs, would affect clot formation time (CFT) in a modified plasma-based clot 94 formation assay [34, ]
 Plasma was perfused through bioreactors seeded with MSCs as well as through 95 circuits in which cells were directly injected into the perfused plasma to make comparative CFT 96 measurements
 We were able to show that bioreactor use significantly prolonged CFT relative to direct 97 injection of the MSCs
 Flushing of concentrated soluble factors from bioreactors further contributed to 98 prolonged CFTs
 Lastly, the previously proposed clinical solution for MSC driven clot formation, 99 anticoagulation with heparin [36-39], was shown to be effective in both perfusion setups
 These results 100 suggest this new modality for systemic MSC delivery may offer a safer alternative to intravenous MSC 101 injection
 The clinically scaled ex vivo engineered MSC delivery is currently undergoing testing in a Phase 102 I/II trial in acute kidney injury (AKI) and COVID-19 associated AKI

 Each direct injection subgroup was 117 processed individually and subgroups were never combined
 The fresh thawed direct injection subgroup 118 was placed into plasma after counting and directly injected for perfusion (Figure )
 The recovered direct 119 injection subgroup allowed for 24 hours of recovery on a cell culture dish, followed by dissociation with 120 TryPLE, counting via Trypan Blue exclusion, and placing into plasma prior to direct injection

 This  hold time intends to mimic the time between device manufacture and 136 Following hold, select MRs were subjected to flushing
 Prior to connection to the perfusion circuit sterile 138 saline (

 Plasma was 151 frozen within 30 minutes of collection at -70 from a pool of >50 donors per lot
 This plasma still 152 contains many essential factors for clot initiation, including prothrombin which can be activated with the 153 addition of calcium via CaCl2 to form firm clots over time

 ;    Clot formation time measurements incorporated the sum of two time periods
 The first period initiates 172 when plasma has been recalcified through the addition of CaCl2 and continues through perfusion until 173 transfer of the samples into microwells for analysis on the spectrophotometer
 This value is immediately 174 recorded by the operator
 The second time period occurs when the spectrophotometric readings begin 175 and continues for 45 minutes
  At the completion of the study the elapsed time in the first period is 176 added to the time required to obtain the  maximal spectrophotometric value, as determined using the 177 clot formation time formula
 Combined, these measurements capture the clot formation time

01 mg/kg, IM) pre-195 surgery, PM the day of surgery and AM the day after surgery, and cefazolin (22 mg/kg, IV/IM) pre-196 surgery, then daily for two additional days post-surgery
 After a 2 day wash out period, animals were 197 dosed according to their group assignment with 6 animals assigned to either a 0M, 250M, or 750M MSC 198 dose group
 Heparin was administered throughout treatment with all animals first receiving a bolus of 199 heparin at 150 U/kg and then a continuous infusion of 25 U/kg every hour
 All animals underwent a 24-200 hour perfusion (+/- 1 hour), with the exception of animal 1003 (Group 1, Control) which was stopped 201 after 22 hours due to low blood flow rate through the catheter

 ;    We developed an approach in which we could test human plasma compatibility of allogeneic MSCs 219 across multiple extents of cell exposure
 Cryopreserved MSCs could either be injected into the plasma 220 directly after thaw (Fig
 1A), cultured for 24 hours after recovery and then directly injected into plasma 221 (Fig
 1B), or seeded into hollow-fiber microreactors with a semi-permeable membrane, allowed to 222 attach, and held for up to 24 hours before being subjected to perfusion (Fig
 C)
 These ranges of 223 administration broadly represent many of the systemic administration options available today and allow 224 the comparison of varying degrees of MSC to plasma exposure and the effects of MSC culture 225 After perfusion, plasma was collected from the circuit via the syringe port and placed into microwells for 227 spectrophotometric reading over time
 The point at which a clot was formed was determined by using 228 the resultant spectrophotometric readout and formula (Fig
 1D, E) to calculate the  maximal value, a 229 point previously determined to designate clot formation [34, ]
 Higher values for clot formation times 230 Consistent with previous work [12], our fresh-frozen pooled plasma-based (FFPP) clot formation assay 234 showed that the presence of MSCs accelerated clot formation under flow conditions relative to acellular 235 controls (Figure )

 ;    individual donor 24 hours after collection instead of FFPP did not result in significantly different clotting 237 times between cellular and acellular groups, likely as it wasnt frozen directly after being pulled (Figure 238 S)
 Spectrophotometric measurements of optical density at 405 nm captured fibrin clot formation as it 239 occurred within the microwell via increases in measured OD over time (Figure A)
 Results from our 240 assays showed that the direct injection (DI) of freshly thawed MSCs into the plasma flow circuit 241 significantly hastened the onset of clot formation when compared to circuits using bioreactor housed 242 MSCs
 Both the 1M BM-MSC and 3M BM-MSC direct injection groups induced clot formation during the 243 initial perfusion, prior to spectrophotometric reading
 All other groups completed perfusion and 244 spectrophotometric reading (Figure B)
 These findings were consistent across 3 separate MSC donors 245 Furthermore, MSC dose played a role in clot formation
 Increases in the number of cells administered 247 were significantly associated with shorter CFTs across both administration routes
 However, when 248 comparing similarly seeded MRs to direct injection with the same number of cells, CFT was significantly 249 slower in the groups where MSCs were housed in the bioreactor (Figure B)
  250 Immobilizing MSCs in the bioreactor allows for cell recovery post-thaw, a process proposed to reduce 253 the surface exposure of pro-coagulation factors []
 In order to investigate the effect of recovering 254 MSCs on clot formation, two known pro-coagulant factors- tissue factor and phosphatidylserine - were 255 measured prior to perfusion
 Flow cytometric analysis of the surface markers on both the freshly thawed 256 and MSCs allowed to recover for 24 hours in culture, showed that cell recovery had significantly lowered 257 the levels of phosphatidylserine and tissue factor (Figure A)

 ;    We next asked whether recovering MSCs post thaw had an effect on clot formation
 CFTs were 259 compared between freshly thawed cells (unwashed or washed) and cells recovered for 24 hours
 Both 260 unwashed and washed freshly thawed conditions quickly clotted at similar times during perfusion 261 suggesting that washing to remove debris and cryopreservative did not affect clot time
 However, CFT 262 was significantly prolonged by allowing for 24 hours of recovery in culture prior to injection (Figure B)
  263 As levels of MSC surface markers appeared to be correlated with clot initiation, we next asked whether 264 limiting the direct interaction of MSC surface markers and plasma could reduce the rate of clot 265 formation
 Interestingly, recovery of MSCs within a microreactor did not significantly affect measured 266 CFTs relative to fully recovered MSCs (Figure B)
 MSCs that were thawed, seeded into MRs, and 267 immediately perfused, clotted at the same time as MSCs that were seeded and allowed to recover for 24 268 hours
 These results suggest that though recovery of cells post thaw significantly reduces MSC induced 269 clotting, housing them in an adherent state on the outside of a hollow fiber seems to further, and more 270 significantly, reduce their clotting potential even without any recovery period
      271 While seeding MSCs on the hollow fiber membrane resulted in prolonged CFT, cellular contribution was 274 still observed as all cellular microreactor circuits clotted in a dose dependent manner (Figure B)
 While 275 in the 24-hour hold period post-attachment, it is likely that MSC derived factors accumulate within the 276 microreactor and may contribute towards clotting
 To directly assay this, we integrated a saline flush of 277 the microreactor into our protocol
 After the 24-hour hold and just prior to perfusion, MRs were flushed 278 with 3X column volume (
5 mL) of saline
 Samples from the microreactor were collected pre-and post-279 flush and subjected to flow cytometric analysis for measurement of tissue factor and 280 phosphatidylserine
 Pre-flush samples showed higher levels of phosphatidylserine and tissue factor in 281 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    the cellular group as expected
 Post-flush samples showed clear reductions in both factors, 282 demonstrating that soluble factors can be effectively flushed out of the hollow fiber filter (Figure A)
 283 Flushing the microreactors significantly prolonged CFT in higher doses (3M), while in lower doses (1M) 284 significance could not be reached
 (Figure B)
 These data indicate that soluble factors (e
 g
 285 phosphotidylserine) are present in the extracapillary space of the bioreactor and can accumulate to 286 Despite significantly reducing the clotting potential of MSCs, bioreactors loaded with the cells at higher 290 doses (3M) still induced earlier clotting when compared to acellular or low-dose (1M) cell bioreactors
 291 Plasma spiked with heparin was used to investigate the potential efficacy of administered 292 anticoagulation in preventing clot formation within the circuitry
 Administration of 
5 U/mL of heparin 293 across all groups was able to completely prevent clot formation, even in the presence of positive control 294 The bioreactor setup can be scaled up with larger filters to allow for perfusion in large animal models
 299 Previous work in in vivo models showed that heparin administration could effectively reduce 300 procoagulant activity of MSCs []
 To reduce the number of animals used, here we compared only 301 between bioreactor groups, no direct injection animal studies were conducted
 We first tested feasibility 302 of perfusion of the device in vivo in a healthy canine model
 Animals were all heparinized to assure 303 safety as extracorporeal treatments (even without cells) have intrinsic clotting potential Dogs were 304 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    grouped into cohorts based on the number of MSCs loaded into a scaled up bioreactor, with doses of 0 305 million, 250 million, and 750 million (n=6 dogs per group) and perfused for 24 hours
 No clotting was 306 Next, we asked the question of whether clotting in vivo would be observed under an pathological 308 conditions, such as acute organ failure, where systemic inflammation may perturb the coagulation 309 pathways
 For this purpose a porcine animal model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was used 310 (Figure 6 A)
 AMI was induced, animals were re-perfused/stabilized for 1 hour and then connected to 311 the bioreactor perfusion circuit for 12 hours
 All animals were perfused without events for 12 hours, 312 with each group showing cardiac injury biomarker induction (Figure 6 B) and similar infarct size (Figure 6 313 C)
 Heparin was administered throughout the perfusion process to maintain a minimum activated 314 clotting time (ACT) of at least 300 seconds (as mandated by IACUC), with neither group requiring 315 significantly more heparin than the other (Figure 6 D, E)
 These data support the use of MSC bioreactors 316 without additional heparin requirements beyond what is used in acellular extracorporeal treatments
  317 In the absence of clear clinical benefit of early allogeneic MSC human trials to meet their therapeutic 320 endpoints, there has been a major focus in recent years to improve the reliability and consistency of the 321 therapeutic cells delivered []
 Improvements in manufacturing processes, more stringent release 322 testing and biobanking has provided a reproducibility to the cell production that has contributed to a 323 clinically approved therapy [8, 28, -]
 However, many cellular concerns still exist, including handling 324 at point of care, thawing, route of delivery, hemocompatibility, and dosing
 Our studies here focused on 325 comparing the potential risks of one of those concerns, MSC induced coagulation, between direct 326 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Most commonly, allogeneic MSCs are delivered for therapeutic effect through systemic administration 328 (intravenous or intra-arterial) accounting for about half of all published studies []
 Systemic 329 introduction has been described as the least invasive, most reproducible, and provides the MSCs the 330 most direct access to modulate systemic inflammation []
 However, this route of administration may 331 increase risks to certain hypercoagulable patients given that MSCs are known to express coagulation 332 factors both on their cell surface and on the exosomes and vesicles they secrete, namely tissue factor 333 and phosphatidylserine [16, 41, ]
 Further, systemically introduced MSCs can rapidly get trapped in 334 the lungs or be cleared, reducing their potential efficacy []
 Because of these concerns, where possible 335 and concordant with the mechanism of action (MoA), alternatives to systemic administration are 336 increasingly utilized, including intramuscular infusions, topical, direct tissue injections, and intracoronary 337 delivery
 While useful for localized applications including tissue regeneration, these routes of delivery 338 are not used to treat systemic applications such as GvHD, and present limitations of their own in terms 339 Here, in concert with the previously mentioned improvements with cellular production, we assayed the 341 value of incorporating an experimental setup which confines MSCs behind the membrane of a hollow-342 fiber filter
  Given that much of the MSCs ability to induce clot formation arises from its cell surface 343 markers and secreted vesicles, we considered that the confinement of the cells and their procoagulant 344 expressing surface markers in one extraluminal location may reduce the rate at which clot formation 345 occurs
 We used an existing bioreactor platform known to retain MSC immunomodulatory capacity in 346 combination with modifications to an existing clot formation assay to assess cellular effect on CFT in this 347 immobilized state relative to direct injection [32, 34, ]
 Through this platform we perfused citrated, 348 platelet poor fresh-frozen pooled plasma
 This plasma contains many essential factors for clot initiation, 349 including prothrombin which can be activated with the addition of calcium via CaCl2 to form firm clots 350 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Immediately after CaCl2 addition, this coagulable (but still liquid) plasma is perfused through the hollow-352 fiber filter platform
  As expected, direct injection of MSCs into the coagulable plasma perfusion circuit 353 led to rapid clot formation in a dose-dependent manner
 Interestingly, perfusion of coagulable plasma 354 through bioreactors seeded with MSCs resulted in clotting at rates significantly slower than their 355 comparable direct injection groups, suggesting that free, circulating MSCs increase thrombosis risk more 356 than bioreactor immobilized MSCs
  Like the direct injection group, the MSC dose seeded in the 357 bioreactor was predictive of CFT with higher doses inducing quicker clots, likely through the increased 358 production of pro-coagulable MSC factors
 It is also important to note that the presence of a filter 359 (acellular microreactor) in the circuit induced clotting faster than a circuit without a microreactor 360 supporting the idea that high surface area biomaterials increase factor adsorption and may contribute 361 to expedited clotting []
  Alternative approaches such as heparin coating the hollow fiber filters prior 362 to MSC seeding may reduce surface adsorption and adhesion, lowering this inherent clot induction 363 Historically, failed MSCs trials have been in part attributed to poor cell processing, including delivery of 365 dead and/or coagulable cells [40, 43, 52, ]
 In this study, washing of cells post thaw did not affect CFT 366 significantly
 However, recovery of cells for 24 hours post thaw did reduce clot formation potential This 367 was shown to correlate with surface marker expression of tissue factor and phosphatidylserine
 Both 368 decreased following recovery, correlating with a slower clot formation time relative to MSCs directly 369 injected into the circuit post thaw
 Recovery culture of cryopreserved MSCs within a microreactor did 370 not have a significant impact on CFT relative to freshly thawed cells within microreactors, suggesting 371 that the MSC confinement by the hollow fiber membrane may actually be playing a role in prolonging 372 CFT
 While MSCs located behind the membrane are still able to exchange their immunomodulatory 373 secreted factors with perfusing solutions, they may be sharing less of their cell surface area and may aid 374 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    in confining their cellular debris to the extracapillary space of the microreactor
 Future studies with 375 more restrictive filter sizes may even further limit MSC exposure and further prolong CFT
  376 Having shown that cell presence shortens clot formation time we sought to use the platform to mitigate 377 that effect as much as possible
 Since our microreactor is composed of hollow fibers, exchange does 378 happen through the 
2 m pores on the fibers in the microreactor
 During hold, MSCs continue to 379 produce materials and some of this accumulated material could be contributing to clot formation
 To 380 assess this, we developed a flush protocol and measured steep drops in known coagulation markers
 381 Consequently, flushing resulted in slower CFTs at higher MSC doses
  Future studies will assay whether 382 flushing also affects immunomodulatory potential relative to unflushed reactors []
 383 Despite the microreactors measured effect of prolonging CFT, it did not completely abrogate the cellular 384 contribution to shortened CFT
 In clinical setting anticoagulation protocols will likely be integrated to 385 ensure designated perfusion times are met
 Our in vitro experiments and in vivo canine studies showed 386 that heparin administration could effectively prevent any cellular induced clot formation during 387 perfusion
 However, many of the patients suffering from systemic inflammation, including those with 388 COVID-19, present with hypercoagulable plasma that will require anticoagulation prior to MSC 389 administration
 Our pig model represented a more physiologically relevant condition in which inflamed 390 animals were perfused with a device scaled for human use
 Under these acute injury conditions, no 391 clotting was observed in animals perfused with devices loaded with 750M MSCs and for 12 hours
 The 392 lack of additional heparin requirement suggests that patients set to undergo MSC-bioreactor perfusion 393 may not need more heparin than a sham control undergoing the same procedure
 Future studies 394 comparing direct infusion of MSCs to bioreactor housed MSCs would be useful to evaluate both for 395 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Given the slower CFT in the microreactor groups relative to the direct injection groups, it is possible that 397 a lower dose of heparin could be administered to the microreactor groups
 Future dose testing will be 398 required to verify this
 Such a finding would be clinically relevant, as reduction in the amount of heparin 399 required to be delivered to critically ill patients may help prevent unintended health consequences
 400 Further, patients which are medically restricted from systemic heparin administration for risk of internal 401 bleeding could potentially be anticoagulated regionally with citrate
 Citrate could be introduced and 402 equilibrated within the MSC bioreactor circuit, allowing MSC factors to be released but without exposing 403 In the unfortunate circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in MSC based therapies has 405 increased markedly
 Case reports, first from China and then worldwide, showed promising 406 improvements in patient health following intravenous MSC infusion, even in severely ill patients [10, 55, 407 ]
 While larger studies are now needed to more completely support these findings, it is clear that 408 intravenous infusion of MSCs for systemic inflammatory conditions such as COVID-19 infection or GvHD 409 continues to have therapeutic potential Remestemcel-L, an ex-vivo culture-expanded adult human MSC 410 suspension for intravenous infusion, which has received positive recommendations from the FDA for 411 steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease in pediatric patients based on an open-label study 412 compared to historical controls []
 The novel delivery approach described here could potentially 413 reduce risk of clot formation from IV administered MSCs, making treatment potentially safer and more 414 We conclude that immobilization of MSCs in a hollow fiber filter contributes to a reduced clot initiation 417 potential relative to directly injected MSCs
 Further removal of cellular byproducts through saline 418 flushing of the bioreactor further reduces the MSC based clot formation potential Additional heparin 419 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
