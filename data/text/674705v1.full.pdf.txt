  20 This was a multicenter, open label, not comparative study performed in Italy and Romania
 21 Female subjects over 18-years-old affected by recurrent BV were included
 The latest 22 episode was diagnosed by Amsel criteria 6-9 days before the start of the study and treated 23 with vaginal metronidazole (gel 
75% mg for 5 days or ovules 500 mg for 7 days)
 The 24 recurrence was defined by at least 2 episodes in the previous 12 months
 Polybactum 25 vaginal ovules, day 1-4-7, were started within the 12th and the 24th hr after the end of 26 The first 41 patients enrolled were evaluated for an interim analysis 6 months after the 28 study started; 2 patients interrupted the trial, leaving 39 evaluable subjects

 The etiology 70 and pathogenesis of this disease are not completely understood, because of the various 71 BV-determining risk factors, , and the treatment is not always effective, resulting in high 72 recurrence rates
 After treatment, up to 58% of women might have a single recurrence or 73 more within 12 months
  Limited data is available regarding optimal management 74 Recurrence are relates to the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus 76 facilitating relapses
 Furthermore, the resistance of pathogens to multiple drugs is a 77 (relatively new) health problem that needs alternative treatments to be developed
 78 Recent studies have found that 90% of women with and 10% without BV have a complex 79 polymicrobial biofilm, which can be demonstrated by electron microscopy of vaginal 80 biopsies
 On women with this disease, the biofilm consists primarily of Gardnerella 81 vaginalis, sometimes including Atopobium vaginae ()
 With standard antibiotic regimens, 82 the bacterial load may decrease, but the biofilm may not be eliminated, thus setting the 83 stage for recurrence after treatment
 Slime produced by bacteria is a mechanism of 84 forming biofilm that shields and protects microbes against the effects of antibiotics

 154 Primary and secondary outcomes
 The primary outcome was the recurrence of BV 155 identified by Amsel criteria (10), determined at baseline and at final visit; a positive 156 diagnosis of BV required meeting three of the following four criteria: 157  proportion of clue cells 20% of total epithelial cells in the vaginal fluid; 159 BV was excluded if only two or less criteria were found at baseline
 On the other hand, the 162 patient was evaluated as a treatment failure when at least two criteria were met at the final 163 visit
 The primary outcome was measured at baseline and the final visit for all patients
 164 The secondary outcomes were the following: vaginal Lactobacillus microbiota assessed by 165 an optical microscopy at  baseline and at the final visit to evaluate the vaginal microflora 166 return rate to normality (11) after Polybactum treatment; signs and symptoms of BV 167 (vaginal discharge, burning, erythema, dyspareunia)

 Grade of erythema was 173 evaluated using the analogic 5-point scale: 0 = no symptoms; 1 = slight; 2 = moderate; 3 = 174 marked; 4 = very marked
 Dyspareunia was evaluated by a dichotomic scale: 0 = absent; 1 175 = present
 All secondary outcomes were measured at baseline and the final visit 176 considering value change from baseline
 Secondary outcome also included the patient 177 assessing the efficacy at the last visit using the 4-point scale: 1 = very good improvement; 178 2 = good improvement; 3 = moderate improvement and 4 = negligible improvement
 Safety 179 was evaluated collecting and analysing the adverse events during the study period and by 180 a global assessment of safety performed by any Investigator using an analogic 4-point 181 scale: 1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = fair and 4 = poor
 182 The study schedule included a visit at baseline (day 0), and a final visit (day 72 to day 183 )
 In addition, the Investigators planned to have 3 phone contacts with the patient: the 184 first at day 281 after the last day of last menses, and the following two after 281 day 185 apart
 On any phone contact the Investigator checked if the patient had any of the BV 186 symptoms and, in this case, performed an unscheduled visit to verify the BV recurrence 187 Sample size determination and statistical methods
 According to published data, the 189 mean recurrence rate of BV after a first episode is from 30 to 50% within 3 months after a 190 first efficacious medical therapy (12); in the present study patients were not allowed oral 191 or vaginal antibiotic therapy after metronidazole treatment for the 3 month study duration; 192 therefore it should be realistic to have a 40% as mean recurrence rates in this study as 193 well

 Treatment compliance rate (the total 222 number of administered ovules from the total number of given ovules) was 
01% for all 223 the patients enrolled, and 100% considering only the patients who completed the trial No 224 relevant findings were evidenced in the medical history and during the physical 225 examination
 All the patients completed an antibiotic treatment with metronidazole vaginal 226 formulation (ovules for 7 days) and no concomitant medication was recorded during the 227 One of the inclusion criteria stated that only subjects with two or more episodes of BV in 229 the last 12 months should enter the clinical trial As observed in Table 2, 26 subjects 230 (
41%) had 2 episodes of BV in the last 12 months, with 12 subjects (
27%) having 3 231 episodes of BV, and 3 subjects (
32%) with 4 episodes of BV
 232 In the analysis of the primary objective of the study, at the final visit (day 72 to day 84 from 233 baseline), 4 recurrences were identified
 Therefore, the recurrence rate of BV after 3 234 months of treatment with Polybactum was 
26% (4 cases in )
 A statistically 235 significant difference (p < 
001) was evidenced comparing this value with recurrence rate 236 data (40%) published in the medical literature ()
 To compare the actual recurrences 237 belonging to our data with those from medical literature, we carried out a time-to-event 238 analysis, also called Kaplan-Meier survival curves
 Data are censored (the event did not 239 occur during clinical trial period or subjects drop-out) or uncensored (the event occurred 240 during the clinical trial)
 As observed from Figure 2, after 1 month of treatment, the 241 probability of not having a BV recurrence is 
6%; the same probability, at the final visit 242 (after 3 months of treatment with Polybactum) is 
 %
 Therefore, we can conclude that 243 the true recurrence rate of BV after 3 months of treatment with Polybactum is significantly 244 The evaluation of Vaginal Lactobacillus microbiota by microscopy using phase contrast of 246 vaginal secretions was measured from lowest to highest concentration by the following 5-247 not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 For 26 out of 39 patients (
67%) the treatment had a 249 beneficial or neutral effect on the Lactobacillus concentration levels and only in 13 patients 250 (
33%) the concentration levels worsened (Figure )
 Chi-squared test evidenced that 251 the differences between these values were at the limit of statistical significance (p-value = 252 
 )
 However, analysing the 35 patients without recurrences only, a statistically 253 significant difference (Maxwell-Stuart asymptotic homogeneity test, p-value = 
022) was 254 evidenced in Lactobacillus concentration levels between baseline and final visit
 (Figure 4)  255 Throughout the study period, symptoms associated with BV (vaginal discharge, burning, 256 erythema and dyspareunia) were monitored and recorded by the Principal Investigators in 257 the CRFs and by subjects themselves in the Patients Diary
 The baseline and final data 258 are reported in Table 
 It could be emphasized that the patients with abnormal symptoms 259 at final visit are the four patients with recurrences and 1 additional patient with isolated 260 mild vaginal discharge
 These extremely positive results were confirmed by the global 261 assessments of efficacy performed at the end of the study by patients
 In fact, it was rated 262 as very good per patients assessments for 
18% of them, good for 
13%, moderate for 263 During the study, two adverse events have been reported
 The cases (mild local itching 265 and mild viral respiratory infection) were evaluated as not related to the tested medical 266 device, recovered after a few days and in both cases the Investigator ruled out the 267 suspicion of BV Recurrence
 After the symptoms, the patient who experienced itching 268 dropped out from the study for personal reasons, having completed only 1 cycle of 269 The Investigators global assessment of tolerability was excellent (38 out of 39 cases) for 271

 ;    According to literature data, given the high prevalence of BV, there is an urgent need to 274 develop products that effectively treat the condition and prevent its recurrence
 In our 275 study, the recurrence rate of BV after 3 months of treatment with Polybactum was 276 
26%, significantly lower than the 40% presented in the medical literature
 It is 277 consented that BV involves the presence of a dense, structured and polymicrobial biofilm, 278 primarily constituted by Gardnerella vaginalis clusters, strongly adhered to the vaginal 279 Since the bacteria within biofilms are not effectively eliminated by the immune system or 281 fully destroyed by antibiotics, biofilm-related infections tend to persist and thus, 282 unsurprisingly, BV tends to have a high rate of relapse and recurrence ()
 283 Although the biofilm was shown to contain high concentrations of a variety of bacterial 284 groups, Gardnerella vaginalis was the predominant constituent and it is now accepted that 285 biofilms in BV are strongly associated with Gardnerella vaginalis ()
 It was shown that 286 Gardnerella vaginalis was able to adhere to and displace precoated protective lactobacilli 287 from the vaginal epithelial cells, while other BV-associated anaerobes, such as Atopobium 288 vaginae and Prevotella, were less virulent ()
 Consequently, the current paradigm is that 289 the establishment of a Gardnerella vaginalis biofilm is a required event for initiation and 290 The new product tested in our study contains polycarbophil, 
04% lauryl glucoside, 292 glycerides; all constituents that have important effects on the main mechanism involved in 293 the pathogenesis of BV
 In fact, lauryl glucoside has a specific bacteriostatic action which 294 inhibits Gardnerella vaginalis growth
 It was proven that Gardnerella vaginalis growth is 295 reduced for 48 hrs by the contact with Polybactum (already at 24 hrs) ()
 The growth of 296 inhibitory activity of the new vaginal product was also demonstrated against Streptococcus 297 (a safe film forming agent well known for its lack of toxicity) and lauryl glucoside, a non-299 not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 The 300 combination of these factors gives the product the unique characteristics of a 301 mucoadhesive property impairing the formation of the biofilm produced by Gardnerella 302 vaginalis
 Finally, an acidifying effect was observed on the vaginal pH which favors the 303 growth of lactobacillus microbiota maintaining a hostile environment for the polymicrobial 304 flora involved in BV to recolonize the vagina
 Therefore, vaginal biofilms play a key role not 305 only in BV pathogenesis, but also in its treatment failure and recurrence
 Most proposed 306 non-antibiotic therapies for BV are vaginal or oral probiotics, with the aim to restore the 307 normal vaginal microbiota
 Several trials evaluated the use of combined metronidazole 308 and/or clindamycin therapy and vaginal probiotics to prevent BV recurrence, but large, 309 randomized, placebo-controlled trials with standardized outcomes are needed to confirm 310 Our study focused on demonstrating that the use of Polybactum in the treatment of BV 312 not only reduces the rate of relapses, but it also improves the microbiological parameters
 313 In fact, for 26 out of 35 patients without recurrences (
28%), the clinical trial had a 314 beneficial or neutral effect on the Lactobacillus concentration levels
 From a clinical point 315 of view, since metronidazole (the most commonly prescribed antibiotic to treat BV) causes 316 only transient suppression of the Gardnerella vaginalis populations in the vagina (19), the 317 combined therapy with this antibiotic plus Polybactum can successfully reduce the 318 anaerobic bacterial pathogens responsible for BV, delaying or preventing the relapse of 319 vaginal infection, thus preventing the administration of antibiotics in repetitive courses
 320 Our study has certain limitations, such as the lack of a placebo treatment arm and only a 321 3-month follow-up after the end of metronidazole treatment
 This last problem will be 322 corrected by the amendment already submitted to the EC to allow a follow up period of 12 323 not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
