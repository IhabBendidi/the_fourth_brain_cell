 46 Here, we report the effect of the CCI on surrogate scores of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 47 Methods: This was a non-randomized longitudinal study, including adults with T2D who were 49 self-enrolled to the CCI (n=262) or to receive usual care (UC, n=87) during one year
 A NAFLD 50 liver fat score [N-LFS] > -
640 defined the presence of fatty liver
 A NAFLD fibrosis score 51 [NFS] of > 
675 identified subjects with advanced fibrosis
 Changes in N-LFS and NFS at one 52 Results: At baseline, NAFLD was present in 95% of patients in the CCI and 90% of patients in 54 the UC
 At one year, weight loss of  5% was achieved in 79% of patients in the CCI vs
 19% of 55 patients in UC (P<
 )
 N-LFS mean score was reduced in the CCI group (-

 ;    Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an important cause of chronic liver disease 87 (CLD), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver transplant worldwide, and is associated with 88 increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and malignancies[-]
 NAFLD 89 is highly prevalent (~70%) among patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes (TD)[]
 T2D is 90 usually associated with the more aggressive form of NAFLD, including non-alcoholic 91 steatohepatitis (NASH, indicating significant hepatocellular injury) and advanced fibrosis[6] and 92 is linked with high risk for all-cause and liver-related mortality[-]
 Currently, there are no 93 approved pharmacological interventions for NASH
 Weight loss via lifestyle changes including 94 dietary modification and exercise is the first-line intervention used in treating and improving 95 NAFLD/NASH[11, ]
 However, the majority of patients do not achieve or sustain targeted 96 weight loss goals[11, ]
 Previous studies show a close relationship between the degree of 97 weight reduction and improvements in most of the NASH-related features, including steatosis, 98 inflammation, fibrosis, insulin resistance and elevated liver enzymes, irrespective of the type of 99 diet consumed[-]
 However, there is an intense debate about what types of diet are most 100 effective for treating NASH and, to date, the optimal degree of energy restriction and 101 macronutrient composition of dietary interventions in subjects with NASH and T2D are not well 102 Low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) and ketogenic diets have demonstrated a superior 104 weight loss effect to low-fat, high-carbohydrate (LFHC) diets in adults with overweight and 105 obesity[23-26] and short-term interventions with very low-carbohydrate diets are associated with 106 improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic control[27, ]

 ;    LCHF and ketogenic diets improve appetite control, satiety and/or reduce daily food intake 108 helping to limit dietary energy consumption while maintaining patient-perceived vigor[]
 In 109 patients with NAFLD, the beneficial effects of LCHF diets on liver enzymes and intrahepatic 110 lipid content (IHLC) have been explored with contradictory results
 Among studies with varied 111 carbohydrate intakes, some reported a significant reduction of aminotransferases[16, 30-32], 112 while others did not report significant changes in these enzymes[17, 33, ]
 A recent meta-113 analysis of pooled data from 10 clinical trials reported that low carbohydrate diet (LCD) in 114 patients with NAFLD led to a significant reduction in IHLC[]
  115 continuous care intervention (CCI) with carbohydrate restriction-induced ketosis and behavior 117 change support significantly reduced HbA1c level and medication usage in patients with 118 TD[]
 The effectiveness of the CCI relies in maintaining a carbohydrate-restricted diet, and 119 monitoring compliance with the dietary regimen by assessing the patients nutritional ketosis by 120 blood tests during the year
 We also demonstrated that one year of the CCI was effective in 121 aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were reduced by 29%, 20% and 13%, 123 all P<
01, respectively
 These findings not only highlight the beneficial effect of the CCI on 124 diabetes management, but also in ameliorating the liver-related injury
 These changes were not 125 reported in the usual care (UC) patients receiving standard diabetes care treatment
 Therefore, in 126 the current post-hoc analysis, we assessed one-year within- and between-group (CCI vs
 usual 127 care; UC) differences in non-invasive liver markers of steatosis (NAFLD liver fat score) and 128 fibrosis (NAFLD fibrosis score) in the full study sample (CCI and UC cohorts)

 Briefly, this was a non-randomized and open-label controlled longitudinal study, 140 including patients 21 to 65 years of age with a diagnosis of T2D and a BMI > 25 kg/m
 Further, 141 patients were excluded if they had significant alcohol intake (average consumption of three or 142 more alcohol-containing beverages daily or consumption of more than 14 standard drinks per 143 week), presence of any other cause of liver disease or secondary causes of NAFLD and 144  Patients were not involved in the design and implementation of the study

 An N-LFS cutoff of > -
640 predicts liver fat (> 
56 % of hepatocytes) with a 163 sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 71% [38, ]
 NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) is a widely 164 validated biomarker for identifying patients at different risks of fibrosis severity
 NFS is derived 165 from age, BMI, hyperglycemia, the AST/ALT ratio, platelet and albumin
 The NFS threshold of 166 < -
455 can reliably exclude patients with advanced fibrosis (negative predictive value  92%) 167 and >

 According to Klines 180 (2011) guidelines [44], seven outcomes (i
 e
, N-LFS, ALT, AST, fasting insulin, triglycerides, c-181 reactive protein, beta hydroxybutyrate) were positively skewed
 We explored two approaches to 182 handling the skewed variables: natural log-transformations and removing the top 1% of values
 183 For N-LFS which includes both positive and negative values, a modulus log-transformation[45] 184 was performed instead of a natural log-transformation
 For every variable except triglycerides, 185 both approaches resulted in new skew and kurtosis values falling within the acceptable range
 186 We conducted sensitivity analyses related to our first aim to compare the two approaches
 The 187 results did not differ between the two approaches, and to make interpretation feasible, we report 188 results from the approach of removing the top 1% of values for the LMM analyses
 For 189 triglycerides, analyses were performed on the log-transformed variable; p-values reported are 190 based on analyses with the transformed variable but the means and standard errors reported were 191 computed from the original variable without any adjustments
 For both ANCOVA and 192 correlation analyses, the natural or modulus log-transformed variables were used to determine 193 The first aim of the study was to examine (1) within-group changes in the study outcomes 195 from baseline to 1 year, and (2) between-group differences (CCI vs

 We also conducted analyses assessing changes in N-207 LFS, NFS, albumin, and platelets on the full study sample because results were not previously 208 reported
  In addition, we examined changes in the proportions of participants meeting clinically-209 relevant cut-offs for N-LFS, NFS, and ALT
 Within-group changes in the proportions from 210 baseline to 1 year were assessed using McNemars test
 Between-group differences in 211 proportions were assessed using Chi-Square test
 For this set of analyses, multiple imputation (20 212 imputations) was used to replace missing values from baseline and 1 year with a set of plausible 213 The second study aim was to explore relationships between (1) changes in weight loss 215 and HbA1c categories and its associations with ALT and metabolic parameters improvements 216 and (2) changes in ALT and metabolic variables

 The proportion of patients losing weight was lower in the UC 321 group with only 17 UC participants (
5%) achieving >5% weight loss and only 4 (6%) with 322 >10% weight loss (Supplementary Figure )
 In the CCI group, there was a trend toward 323 greater mean percentage weight loss (WL) by higher baseline BMI classification, especially in 324 patients losing more than 5% or 10% of body weight (Supplementary Table )
 As shown in 325 Table 3, there were relationship trends between the degree of 1-year of WL (%) and changes in 326 liver, metabolic and non-invasive markers of steatosis and fibrosis among CCI participants
 At 1 327 year, the CCI patients who achieved WL  10% showed the greatest reductions in N-LFS 328 (P<
001) and NFS (P<
001), whereas no statistically significant differences were found 329 between patients with WL from 5%-10% versus <%
 Similarly, patients who achieved WL  330 10% also showed decreases in HbA1c (P<
001) and triglycerides (P<
001) from baseline to 1 331 year
 The one-year probability of suspected fatty liver (N-LFS >-
64) was lower (66%) among 332 patients with WL  10% compared to the other WL groups (<5% [85%] and 5%-10% [%])

 In the full CCI group, 141 (70%) of 201 patients with HbA1c 345 reductions of  
5% at 1 year had normal ALT levels (Figure A)
 Among CCI patients with 346 abnormal ALT levels at baseline, 77 (65%) of 119 patients with a reduction of  
5% in HbA1c 347 showed normalization of ALT levels (Figure B)
 One-year reduction of

4 fold (95% CI: 
 -
3) after controlling for 349 baseline levels of HbA1c, BMI, ALT, diabetes duration, insulin use and weight loss (%) at 1 350 year
 Given that weight reductions ( 5%) can be associated with changes in HbA1c level, we 351 sought to explore whether a reduction of  
5% in HbA1c was still associated with ALT 352 normalization, independent of weight loss ( 5%) (Figures C-D)

5% in 353 HbA1c was associated with higher rates of ALT normalization, regardless of whether or not 5% 354 Adverse events during this trial were previously reported[]

 397 The findings of the current analysis show that one year of a digitally-supported CCI 400 reduced risk of fatty liver and advanced liver fibrosis in overweight and obese adults with TD
 401 Improvements were concurrent with improved glycemic status, reduction in cardiovascular risk 402 factors and decreased use of medications for diabetes and hypertension[,]
 The beneficial 403 effects extended to patients with increased levels of aminotransferase, thus indicating that remote 404 care medically-supervised ketosis is also effective in patients at risk of liver disease progression
 405 The influence of carbohydrate restriction and nutritional ketosis on liver histology of patients 406 with biopsy-proven NASH remains largely unexplored in the context of a well-designed RCT
 A 407 pilot study including five patients with biopsy-proven NASH showed that 6-months of KD (less 408 than 20 grams per day of carbohydrate) induced significant WL (mean of 13 kg) and four of five 409 patients reduced liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis []
 The current study provides evidence 410 that a remote-care medically-supervised KD can improve NASH and even fibrosis
 A recent 411 meta-analysis of ten studies reported the effects of LCD on liver function tests in patients with 412 NAFLD, and concluded that LCD reduced IHLC, but did not improve liver enzymes[35], 413 although heterogeneity among NAFLD populations and interventions were observed across the 414 Among CCI participants, correlations were also found between the improvements in 416 HbA1c and ALT changes, even after controlling for WL and changes in insulin use
 Among 417 subjects with abnormal ALT levels at baseline, a reduction of  
5% in HbA1c was associated 418 with increased rates of ALT normalization
 This finding suggests that liver enzyme 419 improvements may be related to improvements in glycemic control and insulin concentration in 420 addition to weight loss

 ;    advantages of different diets for the treatment of NAFLD[15, 32, 48], and the impact of dietary 422 macronutrient composition remains largely unknown
 Three studies have shown that low-423 carbohydrate and low-fat diets reduced liver fat, transaminases and insulin resistance to similar 424 degrees[15, 21, 48], whereas another study reported that a moderate hypocaloric low-425 carbohydrate diet in insulin resistant patients improved ALT levels more than a hypocaloric low-426 fat diet, despite equal weight loss[]
 Among patients with T2D, a moderate-carbohydrate 427 modified Mediterranean diet (35% carbohydrates, 45% high monounsaturated fat) showed 428 greater ALT reductions than two other higher carbohydrate hypocaloric diets including the 2003 429 Our results also demonstrated that non-invasive risk scores for fatty liver and fibrosis 431 were improved in patients who underwent CCI as compared to the UC control, and greater 432 reductions were observed in patients with the largest reductions in body weight ( %)
  Our 433 results are consistent with previous studies reporting that LCD reduce intrahepatic lipid 434 accumulation[15, 16, 21, 32, ]
 Likewise, 1-year liver fibrosis as assessed by NFS improved in 435 the CCI group, and the proportion of patients with low likelihood of fibrosis increased from 18% 436 to 33% at 1 year of intervention
 Similar to previous studies addressing the impact of weight loss 437 on NASH-related fibrosis[13, 50], we showed a relationship between the degree of weight loss 438 LCD or KD have been proposed to more effectively reduce all features of the metabolic 440 syndrome, which is present in approximately 80% of NAFLD patients, compared to low-fat diets 441 [51, 52]; however, the physiological mechanisms are not fully established[-]
 In line with 442 our findings, Holland et al[56] showed that irrespective of physical exercise, rats fed a ketogenic 443 formulation had lower liver triglycerides and lower activation of the pro-inflammatory NF-kB 444 not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Likewise, a recent human study 445 using a two-week isocaloric carbohydrate restricted diet, not only demonstrated a drastic 446 reduction of hepatic steatosis, but a shift in lipid metabolism pathway from de-novo lipogenesis 447 to -oxidation and increased BHB production[]
 This shift in the lipid homeostasis following a 448 short-term ketogenic diet occurred in conjunction with a shift in gut microbia towards increased 449 folate production as well as decreased expression of key serum inflammatory markers[]
   450 Strengths and weaknesses of this clinical trial have been previously described[]
 Some 451 strengths of this study include a large cohort of patients with T2D and high suspicion of NAFLD, 452 an intervention with one-year of digitally-supported continuous care including monitored 453 adherence to nutritional ketosis, and a control group of patients with T2D provided usual care 454 with standard nutritional recommendations[]
 Relative to prior outpatient interventions, the 455 current study is unusual in the degree of health coach and physician support, the degree of 456 prescribed carbohydrate restriction and the use of BHB as a blood biomarker of dietary 457 adherence
 These attributes may contribute to superior outcomes observed in the intervention 458 group when compared to UC patients
 The multi-component approach used in the intervention, 459 not only encouraged the patient to adapt carbohydrate restriction through continuous monitoring 460 of nutritional ketosis but also provided behavioral support through interaction with their health 461 Some weaknesses of this study include the absence of imaging- or biopsy-proven 463 NAFLD or NASH diagnosis and lack of random allocation to assign patients to intervention and 464 control groups

 ;    In conclusion, one year of a digitally-supported continuous care intervention including 467 individualized nutritional ketosis led to significant improvement in non-invasive markers of liver 468 fat and fibrosis together with sustained weight loss in overweight and obese type 2 diabetes 469 patients
 A relationship was observed between the degree of weight loss and improvements in 470 liver- and non-liver-related outcomes with greater benefits in patients losing more than 10% of 471 body weight
 A reduction of  
5% in HbA1c was independently associated with ALT 472 normalization even after controlling for weight loss
 Medical interventions incorporating 473 ketogenic diets appear effective for improving NAFLD, and therefore, may be an effective 474 approach for reversing the natural history of NAFLD progression, although further studies are 475 needed to confirm potential beneficial effect in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH
