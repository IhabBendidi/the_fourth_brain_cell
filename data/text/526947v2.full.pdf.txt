 ;     Selected patients with large vessel occlusions (LVO) can benefit from thrombectomy up to 24 hours after onset
 Identifying patients who might benefit from late intervention after transfer from community hospitals to thrombectomy-capable centers would be valuable
 We searched for presentation biomarkers to identify such patients
  Frequent MR imaging over 2 days of 38 untreated LVO patients revealed logarithmic growth of the ischemic infarct core
  In 24 patients with terminal internal carotid artery or the proximal middle cerebral artery occlusions we found that an infarct core growth rate (IGR) <
1 ml/hr and initial infarct core volumes (ICV) <
9 ml had accuracies >89% for identifying patients who would still have a core of <50ml 24 hours after stroke onset, a core size that should predict favorable outcomes with thrombectomy
 Published reports indicate that up to half of all LVO stroke patients have an IGR<
1 ml/hr
 Other potentially useful biomarkers include the NIHSS and the perfusion measurements MTT and Tmax
  We conclude that many LVO patients have a stroke physiology that is favorable for late intervention, and that there are biomarkers that can accurately identify them at early time not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;     Patients who suffer strokes caused by large vessel occlusions of the anterior circulation (LVOs, viz
, terminal internal cerebral artery or middle cerebral artery M1/M2 occlusions) typically will have severe neurological deficits and poor outcomes if not treated
 1 While they comprise approximately a third of all ischemic strokes, they cause most deaths and poor outcomes
 Clinical trials have shown that LVO-stroke patients may be effectively treated with thrombectomy within 6-8 hours
2-8  More recently, the DAWN9and DEFUSE-310 trials have proven that thrombectomy may be successful up to 24 hours post ictus in carefully selected LVO patients
 The widening of the thrombectomy time window presents new opportunities to treat LVO stroke patients; the challenge in community hospitals is to identify patients who will benefit from thrombectomy despite late arrivals or delays due to transfer to intervention-capable centers
 We analyzed our cohort of LVO patients who underwent frequent MR imaging over 2 days to identify biomarkers on the admission scan that accurately identify patients likely to have  Our aim was to identify patient biomarkers measured at first hospital arrival that would predict that the infarct core at 24 hours after stroke onset would be no larger than ml
  The time and core size targets are conservative
  Most patients in countries in North America, Europe and Japan are well within a 24-hour drive from a thrombectomy-capable center
  The ischemic core target volume of 50ml was based on the data from the prospective thrombectomy clinical trials that used core volumes of less 50ml 6,9 as inclusion criteria, as well as the observation from the HERMES collaboration11 that revealed that patients with final infarcts of <50ml after thrombectomy had an ~80% probability of living independently at 3 months even when they not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Ischemic core volume growth rates in patients with ICA, M1 & M2 occlusions Table 2 displays the average ischemic lesion growth in LVO patients grouped by initial ICV
 The highest average growth occurred during the initial period between stroke onset and the time of the first imaging
 In all groups, the second period (~5-12 hours) the average growth of the core was less than 10% of the initial period
  The lesion growth during the other periods was also much lower than the initial period for all groups
 Infarct core growth is nonlinear: linear regression resulted in a poor correlation coefficient between lesion volumes and time (R<
6); conversely, correlation coefficients were high (R
96) between lesion volumes and the natural logarithm of time, suggesting logarithmic growth of the ischemic core over 2 days

 ;    Other researchers, most notably the Pittsburgh group 12, have emphasized the importance of slow progressors and their management
 Here we adopt a practical definition of slow progressors as patients with an infarct core of appropriate size to be amenable to successful thrombectomy up to 1 day after onset
 We used a target ischemic core size of <50ml at the time of the 1-day scan to identify these patients
 This conservative core target of 50ml was based on the data from the prospective clinical trials that used core volumes of less than 50ml 6,9 as inclusion criteria, as well as the observation from the HERMES collaboration11 that patients with final infarcts of <50ml after thrombectomy had an ~80% probability of living independently at 3 months Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to find the best biomarkers of treatable slow progressors in the 24 patients with ICA and M1 occlusions
  We compared key characteristics of our patient group with the control cohorts from the DEFUSE3 and DAWN thrombectomy clinical trials and is shown in Table

 ROC Analyses of Baseline Variables To Predict Ischemic Core of  Patients with potentially severe strokes caused by an occlusion of a major cerebral artery but with a favorable physiology have small infarct cores that grow slowly and are likely to be excellent candidates for thrombectomy despite significant time delays
  This finding comes from a cohort of LVO patients who were part of a clinical trial that assessed the value of normobaric oxygen (NBO)
 While NBO was not shown to be effective 13, the study design included multiple MRI scans over a short time and resulted in the unique observations described here
  Using a target ischemic core volume of 50 ml at 24 hours, we found that that the best biomarkers of such a favorable physiology are an infarct core growth rate of <
1 ml/hr or an initial infarct core We chose 50 ml target volume after considering a report from the HERMES collaboration (that combined data from 7 thrombectomy trials) that indicated a 50 ml final infarct volume after thrombectomy results in a high probability of excellent long-term outcomes despite not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    the severity of presenting symptoms
 11 Our targets are not meant to be prescriptive
  Other target volumes may be better
  For example, ROC analysis of a 70 ml target revealed 90%/100% sensitivity/specificity for an IGR <
2 ml
  Suitable volumes may be even larger if there is less eloquence of the tissue at risk, and investigations of larger target volumes in patients with lower NIHSS may also be very useful
   The assessment at 24 hours is also somewhat arbitrary, and was only used because that is the outer time limit of the successful trials published to date
 It is very likely that there will be patients that will benefit from treatment beyond 24 hours
 The reliable identification of LVO slow progressors could greatly expand the use of thrombectomy, and more widely apply the lessons from the recent DAWN 9 and DEFUSE-310 thrombectomy trials that treated patients up to 24 hours after onset
 The substantial number of slow progressors is largely explained by collateral physiology that typically produces logarithmic growth of the ischemic core as documented in this study
 In animal stroke models, the ischemic core also grows in a logarithmic fashion
 14 Documentation of this type of growth in patients has lacked empirical validation
   Wheeler et al 15 suggested logarithmic infarct growth rates in LVO patients using only 2 imaging data points: baseline and 1-week core volumes
  Because 4 imaging studies were performed over 2 days, we are able to validate logarithmic-type growth, and explain on our prior observation of apparent ischemic core stability in LVO patients
16 We found that most of the core growth occurred within the first 6 hours, with less than 10% further growth over remainder of the first day
  Comparison of line fits of core volume with respect to Our findings beg the question of what proportion of all LVO stroke patients are slow progressors
 A review of published studies of patients with LVO that included IGR measurements suggests that a large proportion have growth rates below 
1 ml/hr and are slow not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    progressors as we have defined them here (Table )
 Taken together, the published evidence from nearly 700 LVO patients suggest that up to half of LVO patients are slow progressors
 If this is confirmed, the targeted thrombectomy of slow progressors has the potential to substantially reduce the deaths, severe disabilities and costs due to stroke
 Table 
 Studies of large vessel occlusion stroke patients with published initial infarct growth The very high variability of lesion growth in LVO patients is best explained by differences in the collateral circulation
 17-20 Slow progressors must have robust collateral circulations that persist for long periods
  An important consideration is whether slow progressor LVO patients will still need thrombectomy after a long delay or will spontaneous recanalization make the procedure unnecessary
  We found that only 13% of slow progressors with ICA or M1 occlusions had favorable functional outcomes at 3 months, similar to the control cohorts in the DAWN and DEFUSE-3 thrombectomy clinical trials
   Not undergoing thrombectomy for such occlusions is clearly hazardous, even in slow progressors, because the arterial occlusion may persist for a long period and the advantageous collateral physiology may diminish and ultimately There may be more practical but still effective alternatives to MRI for the identification of LVO patients that are slow progressors

 ;    approaches, and there may be others
  This is important because patients may present at centers without an available MRI
  One alternative may be CT perfusion
  We found that the MR perfusion measurement MTT performed well, and it is likely that a CT perfusion MTT measurement would be similarly effective
 Additionally, while not tested in this study, perfusion CT estimates of the ischemic core may be effective
  A marker that does not rely on imaging is the NIHSS score of <16 in patients with ICA/M1 occlusions: about 90% of slow progressors would be identified, with a false positive rate would be 3 out of 
 A different NIHSS target might be chosen for a higher specificity, but with a lower sensitivity
  For example, an NIHSS 9 is 100% specific and 63% sensitive
   There are likely other effective imaging biomarkers that may derived from CT perfusion, CT angiography, and possibly even noncontrast CT data
   An important strength of this study is that it documented the natural history of ischemic core evolution, without confounders such as thrombolytic use or thrombectomy, which has rarely been done previously
20  A possible limitation is the relatively small number of patients that were studied
  However, the fact that each patient was scanned multiple times makes our findings robust
  A cross sectional study designed to reveal the findings described here would likely require several hundred patients
  There is the potential confound of NBO therapy on the NBO-treated arm; however, there was no significant difference between the NBO and room air treated groups on any imaging variable that was measured including outcomes
 13  In any case, prospective studies are needed to determine the value of imaging biomarkers in making triage In conclusion, ischemic core initial growth rates of <
1 ml/hr and ischemic core volumes of <
9 ml are excellent biomarkers for selecting LVO patients that are likely to benefit from transfer to thrombectomy-capable stroke centers despite a substantial delay
