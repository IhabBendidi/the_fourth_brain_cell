 This study examined the effects of a 29 combined intervention of mindfulness meditation followed by aerobic walking exercise in chronic 30 low back pain (cLBP) patients
 We hypothesized that meditation before exercise would reduce 31 disability and pain by increasing mindfulness prior to physical activity
 Thirty-eight adults 32 completed either meditation and exercise treatment (MedExT) (n=18) or an audiobook control 33 condition (n=)
 Over a 4-week period, participants in the MedExT group performed 12-17 34 minutes of guided meditation followed by 30 minutes of moderate intensity walking exercise 5 35 days per week
 Measures of disability, pain, mindfulness and anxiety were taken at baseline 36 and post-intervention
 Ratings of pain were also assessed by participant self-report, before and 37 after each intervention session
 Following MedExT, participants showed significant improvement 38 in our primary outcome of disability compared to the control group (p<
 )
 From pre to post-39 intervention, MedExT also increased mindfulness (p<
05), but had no significant effect on 40 quantitative sensory testing on the low back
 Mean ratings of low back pain intensity and 41 unpleasantness significantly improved with MedExT from before the study to during 42 participation, respectively (intensity p<
05; unpleasantness p<
 )
 Overall, four weeks of 43 MedExT produced substantive changes in disability, mindfulness and measures of pain intensity 44 Keywords: exercise, mindfulness meditation, QST, chronic low back pain, integrative health 47 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;     Low back pain is the most common reported type of pain [16] and the second leading 49 cause of physician visits and disability among U
 S
 adults []
 Globally, 25% of adults report 50 having low back pain over any one month []
 Often due to non-specific causes and 51 complicated by comorbid symptoms [19], low back pain remains difficult to treat
 Current 52 treatments include NSAIDS, muscle relaxants, opioids, psychological therapy, physical therapy 53 chiropractic manipulation, injections and surgery [1, ]
 Chronic low back pain is further made 54 complex by the potential for comorbid anxiety disorders []
 In particular, musculoskeletal pain 55 is often associated with fear avoidance anxiety behavior and kinesiophobia []
 This 56 kinesiophobia or fear of movement can further exacerbate pain and subsequent disability
 57 Kinesiophobia may also reduce the potential benefit of physical treatments in patients by 58 increasing state anxiety before and during therapy
 In treating chronic pain, a major gap exists 59 in not only treating the physiological condition, but also addressing the interplay with 60 Due to the risk of adverse side effects, addiction and misuse, many pharmacological 62 approaches to treating low back pain, including opioid therapeutics, have not been found to be 63 superior to complementary treatment methods []
 There has been a significant push in the last 64 20 years to identify and understand complementary and integrative therapies to supplement 65 acupuncture, spinal manipulation and massage with many of these showing significant positive 69 effects []
 There has been considerable interest in programs that combine elements of 70 multiple therapies to treat chronic pain
 One of most well-established integrative programs that 71 involves elements of stress reduction, exercise, and meditation is the 8-week MBSR system, 72 which has been found to improve pain, depression and quality of life []

 In the current study, we examined a more feasible pilot program of introductory 75 mindfulness meditation that novice meditators could easily put into practice prior to aerobic 76 walking exercise
 Both meditation and exercise have been independently investigated in the 77 Exercise interventions have proven to have beneficial outcomes on pain severity, 79 physical disability, psychological function and health-related quality of life across various chronic 80 pain conditions []
 Mechanistically, aerobic exercise at a level of at least 70% of the maximum 81 aerobic capacity generates the production of endorphins and elicits other pain inhibitory 82 mechanisms driven by the central nervous system [6, ]
 In addition, aerobic exercise has 83 been shown to reduce fatigue and improve peak oxygen uptake, and physical fitness [17, ]
  84 Similar to exercise, studies incorporating mindfulness meditation have largely shown to 85 improve pain and depression symptoms, quality of life, well-being and increase mobility and 86 functioning [26, ]
 Mechanistically, meditation with mindfulness has been associated with 87 decreased levels of cortisol [28], increased signaling connections in the brain [49], improved 88 pain processing and emotional control [31], and altered amygdalar response to emotional stimuli 89 []
 As these therapies (exercise and meditation) independently improve disability and pain, the 90 Meditation and Exercise to Treat chronic low back trial (MedExT) tested the effects of a 4-week 91 intervention of a guided mindfulness meditation program combined with moderate intensity 92 walking exercise performed 5 days per week in chronic low back pain (cLBP) patients
 We 93 hypothesized that this intervention would improve disability (primary outcome), pain, anxiety and 94 increase mindfulness compared to control participants

 For at-home intervention sessions, subjects were encouraged to perform 176 intensity walking exercise on a treadmill
 Prior to the first exercise session, resting heart rate 179 and age was used to calculate a heart rate that corresponded to 50% heart rate reserve (HRR) 180 for each participant []
 We used the 50% HRR estimate as the target heart rate for moderately 181 intense exercise with a range of 40-60% HRR calculated for each participant

 meditation, exercise or both) a majority of participants stated 383 that Both components of the intervention were the most important

 ;     In the current study, we assessed the effect of a combined intervention of mindfulness 386 meditation followed by aerobic walking exercise in chronic low back pain
 The main findings of 387 this study indicate that meditation and exercise together were able to reduce disability, increase 388 mindfulness and decrease self-reported ratings of low back pain
 To our knowledge, this specific 389 therapy combination has not yet been tested in chronic low back pain patients
  390 While the present study took a unique approach to combined mindfulness and aerobic 391 exercise, there is a robust literature suggesting that such an approach could work
 First and 392 foremost, previous studies have tested MBSR [4, 12, 20, 38, 39, 47] and mindfulness meditation 393 [58] alone, as well as aerobic walking exercise programs [5, 10, 18, 24, 30, 32, 40, 50] in low 394 back pain patients
 Overall, these studies found improved disability, sleep quality, psychological 395 function, depression, affective pain perception, fitness, pain severity, and reduced need for pain 396 medications
 One important aspect of the mindfulness used in the present study was the 397 accessibility of the mindfulness
 Beyond the introductory 45-minute session with a clinical 398 psychologist, our participants were nave meditators
 Nonetheless, using only five short 399 recordings repeatedly, their mindfulness increased as assessed by the FMI
 Gains seen in this 400 study via the FMI compare to more intensive training exercises []
 Although the recordings 401 used here were curated for their emphasis on mindfulness, they were not specifically recorded 402 for this intervention
 We would hypothesize that the development of a mindfulness recording 403 that specifically prepared participants for the subsequent exercise could be even more 404 beneficial The benefits seen here with a brief meditation program are consistent with more 405 recent data showing that only 4 days of mindfulness-based mental training can reduce pain [55-406 ]
 Importantly, these previous studies were done in healthy participants with models of acute 407 nociception, while here we are showing gains in mindfulness in a chronic patient population
  408  In our previous work, we have elucidated that increasing the frequency component of 409 exercise dose to be the most likely to have a positive effect on chronic pain patients []

 ;    tested these predictions in a trial with multiple doses of moderate intensity treadmill walking 411 exercise in healthy subjects
 Treadmill walking exercise was chosen because it was easy to 412 implement, required little to no training and had more precision in controlling dosage
 In this 413 study, we found that the moderate dose, or 5x of 30 minutes/day of this exercise regimen in one 414 week proved to be the most optimal for reducing cutaneous pressure pain ratings []
 We 415 reasoned that this aerobic exercise intervention was a good starting dose for reducing pain 416 outcomes
 In addition, this prescription aligns with that of ACSMs recommendation for physical 417 activity for healthy individuals which is 150 MET minutes per week []
  418 Surprisingly, while MedExT participants rated lower disability along with lower on-going 419 pain and lower average pain compared to the start of trial, they failed to show any changes in 420 fear avoidance behavior or anxiety
 This result is in contrast to data generated from a similar 421 study that implemented combined mindfulness and exercise in the context of major depression 422 []
 That study found 8 weeks of 60-minute twice a week mental and physical training 423 significantly reduced depressive symptoms and ruminative thoughts
 It is possible that the lack 424 of a significant effect on fear and anxiety in the present study was driven by the lower starting 425 anxiety and fear levels in our cohort of participants
 We anticipate that the anxiolytic effects of 426 the combined intervention may only present itself in the context of higher baseline anxiety and 427 fear avoidance behavior or with longer duration studies (i
 e
 8 vs 4 weeks)
     428  During the trial, participants rated pain before and after each session
 Thus, we were 429 able to track their on-going pain before each intervention compared to baseline and evaluate the 430 potential for acute analgesic effects of the intervention itself
 Analysis of day to day pre-431 intervention ratings of on-going low back pain revealed significant effects of time and time x 432 respectively
 Acutely however, there were no significant changes comparing pre-intervention to 434 post-intervention on single days
 Taken together, these data are indicative of a time dependent 435 effect of the intervention with beneficial outcomes resulting from cumulative repeated treatment 436 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    sessions
 Interestingly, the data do not begin to show separation across time between the 437 groups until about day eight for pain intensity ratings and day ten for pain unpleasantness 438 ratings
 This suggests that for this specific intervention, sustained analgesic benefit can only be 439 achieved after 8-10 sessions or about two weeks of effort
   440 Our data show significant differences in qualitative ratings of low back pain, but no 441 significant effects with QST
 Interestingly, we do see trends for decreased ratings of pain 442 unpleasantness (p=
0338) in response to a noxious constant pressure stimulus applied to the 443 low back
 Although, subjects pressure pain threshold was unchanged from baseline, their 444 perception of that same pain declined
 These paradoxical effects are consistent with that of a 445 previous study that tested aerobic treadmill walking exercise on painful QST in healthy 446 participants []
 Similar effects have also been shown in sustained aerobic exercise, where 447 training induced increases in pain tolerance, but unaltered pressure pain threshold []
 448 Using daily Qualtrics survey monitoring and wrist-worn activity trackers, we were able to 449 estimate compliance from participants beyond self-report
 Results from a sub-analysis for fully 450 compliant patients only (MedExT; n=13, Control; n=20) shows significant improvements in 451 disability and an increase in mindfulness for MedExT subjects, which is consistent with our 452 analysis of the full data set (MedExT; n=18, Control; n=)
 Even the individuals who were 453 estimated to be noncompliant (n=5) still exercised at least 7 days
 Overall, this analysis 454 suggests that compliance was not a major confound of the reported results
   455 Results of our continued compliance survey given during the exit session shows 456 favorable outcomes for the combined meditation and exercise intervention
 In particular, the 457 finding that a majority of MedExT group participants found the most beneficial component of the 458 intervention was the combination of the exercise and meditation suggests the potential for 459 synergistic effects in this study
 The need for pharmacological pain treatments trended to 460 decrease for the MedExT group compared to control subjects, which suggests analgesic benefit 461 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    of a solely nonpharmacological source
 MedExT participants also indicated that they would be 462 likely to continue the combined intervention on their own to manage their back-pain symptoms
  463  Notable strengths to this study included a low risk of detection bias through blinding of 465 the outcome assessor for QST, and a lack of confounding demographic variables
 The average 466 age of study participants was 
6 years, which accurately represents the range of our inclusion 467 criteria (-)
 Additionally, after subtracting intervention walking steps, there was no statistical 468 difference in average steps per day between control and MedExT subjects
 The most significant 469 limitation to this study is the lack of all possible study arms
 Without exercise-only and 470 meditation-only groups, the hypothesis of synergy between the individual therapies cannot be 471 specifically tested
 This study had a higher risk of performance bias, due to lack of blinding of 472 participants, which is very difficult due to the nature of the interventions
 Also, the order of QST 473 assessment was not randomized, which could contribute to additional outcome bias
 These 474 tests were performed from least invasive to most invasive, to avoid increased sensitization
 475 Patients in this trial were mostly female (n=25) compared to male (n=13), however chronic low 476 back pain is reported to be more prevalent among women []
 According to our continued 477 compliance survey, the most prominently identified barriers to continuing this treatment after 478 conclusion of the trial included time and motivation to complete both interventions
 Notably, no 479 patients reported increased pain with both meditation and exercise
 Thus, while we cannot state 480 conclusively that there was synergy between the treatments, we can be confident that the 481 therapies are not overtly antagonist
 Other reported barriers included lack of access to a 482 treadmill or guided meditations
 Although, it is worth noting that access to additional meditations 483 were provided to interested patients following their completion of the trial  484  The results of this study demonstrate that a combined therapy approach of mindfulness 486 meditation followed by moderate intensity treadmill walking provides a significant benefit to 487 certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Patients in this treatment group also 488 report less need for pain medications, and favorability for the combined approach as opposed to 489 meditation or exercise therapy alone
 This is the first study testing this treatment combination in 490 chronic low back pain patients
 Because synergistic benefits could not be definitely determined 491 from this trial, future studies must be done to conclude the most efficacious combination of this 492 treatment regimen
  Nonetheless, we feel the potential for this combined approach to improve 493 outcomes in chronic low back pain is high
 As exercise and meditation (as practiced in this 494 study) are low cost, easy to implement, and carry few negative side-effects, we are optimistic 495 about the use of this or similar integrative therapy in the clinic

 Intervention and acute effects of MedExT intervention compared to control
 Data shown as mean +/- SEM with analgesic 691 responses being values lower than 0 on y-axes
 Intervention effects are shown in A-B comparing VAS measurement taken 692 immediately prior to each days session versus the baseline VAS measurement taken on intake day
 Statistically significant analgesic 693 effects were seen in the MedExT group for (A) VAS intensity (Time (***p=
0008), time x treatment (**p=
0012)) and (B) VAS 694 unpleasantness (Treatment (*p=
0330), time (**p=
0022), time x treatment (****p<
 ))
 Acute intervention effects shown in C-D 695 comparing VAS taken after each days intervention to the VAS taken immediately before the intervention
 No significant differences 696 were found for  (C) VAS intensity (n
