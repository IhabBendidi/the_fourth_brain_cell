 ;    human cardiomyocytes are used for in vitro cardiac safety testing
 hiPSC-CMs have been associated with a vast heterogeneity regarding single-cell morphology, beating behavior and Previously published hiPSC-CM studies revealed action potentials with nodal-, atrial- or ventricular-like morphology, although ion channel expression of singular hiPSC-CMs is not fully understood
 Other studies used single-cell RNA-sequencing, however, these studies did not extensively focus on expression patterns of cardiac ion channels or failed to detect ion channel transcripts
 Thus, the current study used a single-cell patch-clamp-RT-qPCR approach to get insights into single-cell electrophysiology (capacitance, action potential duration at 90% of repolarization, upstroke velocity, spontaneous beat rate, and sodium-driven fast inward SCN5A, KCNJ2, CACNA1D, and KCNH2), the combination of both within individual cells, and their correlations in single cardiomyocytes
 We used commercially available hiPSC-CMs (iCell cardiomyocytes, atrial and ventricular Pluricytes) and primary human adult atrial and differences between the cell groups and variation within the hiPSC-CMs groups as well as within primary ventricular cardiomyocytes
 Expression analysis on mRNA level showed no-clear-cut discrimination between primary cardiac subtypes and revealed both similarities and differences between all cell groups
 Higher expression of atrial-associated ion channels in primary atrial cardiomyocytes and atrial Pluricytes compared to their ventricular counterpart between the single-cell parameters was challenging, as the total data set is complex, particularly for parameters depending on multiple processes, like the spontaneous beat rate
 Yet, for example, expression of SCN5A correlated well with the fast inward current amplitude for all three hiPSC-CM groups
 To further enhance our understanding of the physiology and composition of the investigated hiPSC-CMs, we compared beating and non-beating cells and assessed distributions of single-cell data
 Investigating the single-cell phenotypes of hiPSC-CMs revealed a combination of attributes which may be interpreted as a mixture of traits of different adult cardiac cell types: (i) nodal-related pacemaking attributes are spontaneous generation of action potentials and high HCN4 expression; and (ii) non-nodal attributes: cells have a prominent INa-driven fast inward current, a fast upstroke velocity and a high expression of SCNA
 In conclusion, the combination of nodal- and non-nodal attributes in single hiPSC-(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    Primary human cardiomyocytes as well as human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are used as model systems in pharmacological and toxicological drug testing (Magdy, Schuldt, Wu, Bernstein, & Burridge, 2018; Nguyen et al, 2017; Pang et al, 2019; Yoshida & Yamanaka, )
 They are, for example, recommended in the context of the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative (Wallis et al, )
 For the assessment of potential acute, electrophysiological side effects of drug candidates, it is essential to know the electrophysiological characteristics and ion channel expression of a cardiomyocyte model
 For hiPSC-CMs, expression of cardiac ion channels was reported on a population level and single-cells were shown to display ionic currents (Barbuti, Benzoni, Campostrini, & DellEra, 2016; Karakikes, Ameen, Termglinchan, & Wu, 2015; Ma et al, )
 However, these studies used different subsets of cells for the investigation of bulk ion channel expression morphologies of individual cells
 Moreover, we recognized that some cells were contracting while others werent and that action potential durations varied immensely between different cells
 These first observations of obvious differences between individual cells prompted us to perform a systematic characterization of hiPSC-CMs on the single-cell level and to compare It is well established that cardiomyocytes from different regions of the heart (nodal, atrial and morphology (Kane & Terracciano, )
 Heterogeneity of hiPSC-CMs has been mainly assessed with two approaches
 On the one hand, single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed
 The majority of studies using this approach did not detect distinct transcriptomic cardiac subtype related clusters in hiPSC-CMs (Biendarra-Tiegs, Li, et al, 2019; Friedman et al, 2018; Schmid, Wohnhaas, Hildebrandt, Baum, & Rast, )
 In contrast, one single-cell RNA-sequencing study reported atrial and ventricular related gene expression (Churko et al, )
 On the other hand, a second approach used action potential morphology to classify hiPSC-CMs into nodal-, atrial-, and ventricular-like cells (Ma et al, 2011; Yonemizu et al, )
  In our opinion, action potential morphology alone is not sufficient to classify hiPSC-CMs into primary subtypes due to missing information about the underlying ionic currents and channels

 ;    using a single-cell patch-clamp-RT-qPCR technique
 For this purpose, we used three different Pluricytes) and compared them with primary adult human atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes
 We chose to focus on nine cardiac ion channel genes (HCN4, CACNA1G, CACNA1D, KCNA5, KCNJ4, SCN5A, KCNJ2, CACNA1C and KCNH2) because of their cardiac subtypes
 For the understanding of the present study, it is essential to know that the SCN5A gene (coding for the NaV
5 channel subunit and conducting INa) is associated with the fast inward current and the upstroke of the action potential in primary atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, while it shows no/low expression in primary nodal cells (Kane & Terracciano, 2017; Priest & McDermott, )
 In primary nodal cardiomyocytes, depolarization is mainly driven by HCN4 (conducting the If current), CACNA1G (coding for CaV
1 which conducts ICaT) and CACNA1D (coding for CaV
3 which conducts ICaL) and these ion channels are known to contribute to pacemaking in these cells (Baig et al, 2011; Bartos, Grandi, & Ripplinger, 2015; Mesirca, Torrente, & Mangoni, )
 While these three channels also show expression in atrial cells, no/low expression was detected in ventricular cardiomyocytes (Kane & Terracciano, )
 The absence of the IK1 current (KCNJ2 and KCNJ4, coding for Kir
1 and Kir
3, respectively) is also assumed to contribute to pacemaking in primary nodal cells (Goversen, van der Heyden, van Veen, & de Boer, 2018; Verkerk et al, )
 The expression of KCNA5 (coding for KV
5 which conducts IKur) is highly associated with primary atrial cardiomyocytes (Kane & Terracciano, 2017) and ICaL (CACNA1C coding for CaV
2) and IKr (KCNH2 coding for KV
1/HERG) are related to action potential duration (Rast, Kraushaar, Buckenmaier, Ittrich, & Guth, )
 First, we compared the electrophysiological and transcriptomic results within and between the groups on a population and a single-cell level
 Next, we assessed whether beating and non-beating cells within a hiPSC-CM group differ with respect to electrophysiology or ion channel expression
 In addition, we investigated whether distributions of single-cell parameters help to determine subpopulations or whether single-cell could be classified into primary cardiac subtypes (nodal, atrial, and ventricular)

 iCell cardiomyocytes originated from 5 different vials of the same lot, ventricular Pluricytes from 3 vials of the same lot and atrial Pluricytes from 2 vials of the same lot
  iCell cardiomyocytes were cultured as described previously (Schmid et al, )
 Briefly, the following steps were performed: After thawing, iCell cardiomyocytes (product number 01434, Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics, Madison, WI, USA) were centrifuged (180 x g for 5 min) and resuspended in Plating Medium (Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics, Madison, WI, USA)

 iCell cardiomyocytes were then exposed to 
25% trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, St

 Ventricular and atrial Pluricytes were exposed to TrypLE Express (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 10 min at C
 Afterwards, Maintenance Medium (Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics, Madison, WI, USA, for iCells) or Pluricyte Cardiomyocytes Medium (Ncardia, Gosselies, Charleroi, Belgium, for Pluricytes) was added to the cardiomyocytes, and pipetted up and down ten times, using a P1000 pipette (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany)
 Then, the cell suspension was transferred into a 50 mL-tube (Corning, New York, NY, USA) and diluted with Maintenance Medium or Pluricyte Cardiomyocyte Medium up to a minimum of 15 mL in total iCell cardiomyocyte suspensions were centrifuged at 180 x g for 5 min
 Pluricyte suspensions were centrifuged at 125 x g for 5 min
 Supernatant was aspirated and remaining cells were resuspended in an adequate volume of Maintenance Medium or Pluricyte Cardiomyocyte Medium to achieve a 1:4-1:6-splits (seeding volume: 200 L cell suspension per well)

 Single-cell suspensions were stored in proprietary storage solution at 4 C until use
 Primary ventricular cardiomyocytes were used 1 - 5 days after isolation and atrial cardiomyocytes were used 1- 4 days after isolation by trickling cell solution on laminin-coated (24 h at 4 C or 2 h at rt) glass All procedures were performed under ribonuclease (RNase)-free conditions to the largest extent feasible: Dedicated RNase-free workbench, equipment, and material was used, either bought labeled RNase-free or cleaned with RNaseZap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) or ElectroZap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) or treated with low-pressure USA), barrier tips (Eppendorf) and UltraPure DNase/RNase-free water (not DEPC treated, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were used

 ;    hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes was counted visually for 30 s
  Recordings were started were performed as fast as possible to avoid both diffusion of mRNA into the pipette and mRNA degradation
 To record the fast inward current, cells were clamped at a holding potential of -100 mV (to make sure sodium channels were not inactivated) followed by a voltage step to -30 mV for 100 ms
 Current and voltage signals were Bessel filtered at 10 kHz before being digitized at 20 kHz
 Rs was compensated to a level that safely allowed recording devoid of ringing throughout recordings (typically %)
 Inward current peak amplitudes were obtained by subtracting holding current at -100 mV from the inward peak current at -30 mV
 Action potential recordings were obtained by a gentle switch to current-clamp mode at a holding potential of -80 mV, i
 e
 the command current in current clamp mode is automatically set to the average value determined in voltage clamp mode for the holding potential To ensure comparability of action potentials the command current was adjusted to keep cells in a range of -76 mV to -84 when necessary
 Action potentials of hiPSC-CMs were triggered by injecting rectangular current pulses (500  1000 pA for 2-3 ms) every 3 s
 For recordings from primary cardiomyocytes, current pulses were 1000-4000 pA for 1-3 ms every 3 s
 Three replicate voltage clamp sweeps and three replicate current clamp sweeps per cell were used for analysis
 Current and action potential traces were exported to Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA, USA) for beat rate [bpm], inter-beat interval [ms] (calculation from counted beat rate, includes only beating cells, as inter-beat interval would be not defined for rate = 0 but we wanted to investigate the beating cells as a sub-group), fast inward current amplitude [nA], fast inward current density (current normalized to cell capacitance; [pA/pF]), upstroke velocity of action potential (AP) [V/s] and APD90 (AP duration at 90% repolarization, for calculation see APD90 = t [at V 90 % repolarisation] - t [at max

 For the subsequent single-cell RT-qPCR procedure see 
 
 One coverslip with cardiomyocytes was used for a maximum of 30 min
 In total, 72 iCells, 24 atrial Pluricytes, 29 ventricular Pluricytes, 40 primary atrial human cardiomyocytes and 90 primary ventricular human cardiomyocytes were collected
 It was not possible to determine every parameter for every single cell for technical reasons; Single-cell mRNA expression of nine cardiac ion channel genes (KCNJ2, KCNJ4, HCN4, Ambions Single Cell-to-CT kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in combination with the TaqMan gene expression assay technology (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used
 The TaqMan gene expression assays are listed in Table 
 The reagents contained in the kit
 Briefly, the following steps were performed: After having collected single cells (see 
4) in single nuclease-free 
2 mL PCR-tubes (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany, already containing 9 L Single Cell Lysis Solution and 1 L Single Cell DNase), samples were incubated at rt for 5 min
 Next, 1 L Single Cell Stop Solution was added and samples were incubated at rt for 2 minutes and subsequently frozen (-20 C) until further processing
 
5 L RT Master Mix was added to each sample and reverse transcription (25 C for 10 min, 42 C for 60 min, and 85 C for 5 min) on a thermal cycler was performed to synthesize cDNA
 Next, 11 L PreAmp reaction mix containing pooled 
2 x TaqMan Gene Expression Assays for all targets, was added to every sample and targeted preamplification was performed (95C for 10 min, 14 cycles of 95C for 15 s and 60C for 4 min, and finally 99C for 4 min)

 RT-qPCR (50 C for 2 min, 95 C 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 C for 5 s and 60 C for 1 min) of every target was performed in single reactions as technical duplicates using the Roche Lightcycler 480 (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
 A no-template-control (w/o cDNA) was included in all experiments as negative control
 CT values (inversely proportional to the number of mRNA molecules on the Detection of TNNT2 (structural cardiac gene) and GAPDH (potential house-keeping gene) was used to confirm the successful aspiration of a cell
 Thus, samples not showing expression of TNNT2 or GAPDH were excluded from analysis
 In case a CT value was given the tag detector call uncertain (often the case for very high CT-values) or in case of atypical amplification curves, this CT was replaced by the value of the technical replicate (if available and valid) or excluded from analysis (if the replicate was invalid as well)
 In case the Lightcycler 480 did not detect a signal, reactions were indicated with CT = 
 The highest CT value reported by the instrument for our experiments was CT = 35, tagged with the note Late Cp call (last five cycles) has higher uncertainty
 It was reported previously, that very high CT values may not be reliable and that the CT value corresponding to a single target cDNA molecule is usually -37 cycles for micro titer plates (Sthlberg, Rusnakova, Forootan, Anderova, & Kubista, )
 Therefore, we set all CT = 0 values to CT = 35 and defined a value of CT = 35 as negative result (no detectable expression)
 Accordingly, the percentage of positive cells was calculated for binary analysis
 For further quantitative, statistical analysis, CT values of CT = 35 were excluded
 A more accurate method would have been to determine a standard curve for every target gene and derive the slope (efficiency) and y intercept (detection limit)
 However, determining standard curves for single-cell experiments is challenging, as the calibrator sample should consist of the same complex biological matrix and be processed in exactly the same way as the experimental samples
 As we did not determine standard curves/efficiencies, we performed downstream analysis using CT values and did not calculate numbers of transcripts
 Moreover, we did not compare between different ion channels, as we cannot assure that calculated the mean CT and standard deviation (SD) for the positive cells as surrogate for the expression level
 Not surprisingly, for cells of different origins, we recognized that primary cardiomyocytes have overall lower CT values (higher expression levels) for every target gene investigated except HCN4 and CACNA1G than the three hiPSC-CM groups (see Table )

 However, individual normalization of single-cell data is generally not recommended by the manufacturer (FAQ Single Cell-to-CT qRT-PCR Kit, 2020) and in literature (Sthlberg et al, )
 Nevertheless, in order to compare expression between the five cell groups despite of their different expression levels, we normalized each individual CT value for a specific ion channel with respect to the mean CT value of GAPDH and TNNT2 of the whole cell group
 We calculated CT values for every cell and target gene by subtracting the averaged CT of TNNT2 and GAPDH for the whole cell group from the respective ion channel CT for each individual cell:  CTIonchannel = CTIonchannel - [(MeanCellgroup (CTTNNT2) + MeanCellgroup (CTGAPDH)) / 2] The five cell groups were compared regarding the percentage of positive cells and the mean Table 1: TaqMan gene expression assays used for experiments

 The velocity of action potential upstroke was significantly slower in atrial Pluricytes compared to every other cell slower than in ventricular Pluricytes
 Differences of the spontaneous beat rate were only investigated in hiPSC-CMs, as primary ventricular cardiomyocytes generally do not beat without external stimulation
 For a high percentage of single hiPSC-CMs, spontaneous beating was observed (iCell cardiomyocytes: 83 %, ventricular Pluricytes: 66 %, atrial Pluricytes: %)

 The mean expression levels (CT) for SCN5A were comparable between the groups
 Only between ventricular Pluricytes and ventricular primary cardiomyocytes a significant difference could be observed, indicating that the mean expression in ventricular Pluricytes was higher (lower CT value) than in ventricular primary cardiomyocytes (see Figure 4, Table )
 For CACNA1C, no significant difference between the two primary cardiomyocyte groups and between the three hiPSC-CM groups could be observed

 Besides the percentage of positive cells (% pos
 Cells) and the number of investigated cells (n), also CT values are listed
 Primary ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes showed an overall higher expression level (lower CT values for every target gene investigated except HCN4 and CACNA1G) than the three hiPSC-CM groups
 In order to compare expression between the five cell groups, despite their different sizes, we normalized each individual CT value for a specific ion channel with respect to the mean CT value of GAPDH and TNNT2 of the respective cell group
 The resulting normalized CT values (=CT) are listed in this table as well
 Standard deviations (SD) are identical for CT and CT values because the difference between the two values is a constant
 For details of analysis of single-cell RT-qPCR data, see In addition, ventricular Pluricytes showed a significantly higher mean CT than iCell cardiomyocytes

 Moreover, there is a significant difference between atrial Pluricytes (lower mean CT) and primary ventricular cardiomyocytes (higher mean CT)
 For KCNA5, 96% of the atrial Pluricytes and 100% of the primary atrial cardiomyocytes were positive with comparable mean CTs
 Both these cell groups show, compared to every other cell group, the significantly lowest mean CT value (highest expression)
 Interestingly, with 88% also a high The percentage of positive cells for KCNJ2 showed the same pattern for Pluricytes and primary cells: A higher percentage of ventricular Pluricytes and ventricular primary cardiomyocytes (93% and 97%, respectively) was positive for KCNJ2 than of their atrial counterpart (atrial Pluricytes: 31%, primary atrial cardiomyocytes: %)
 No significant difference was observed between the three hiPSC-CM groups for the mean CT of KCNJ

 However, there is also a subset of cells, which  when the spontaneous beating rate was to be counted immediately before patch clamping commenced  did not beat spontaneously
 We hence asked whether beating and non-beating cells within one hiPSC-CM group (iCell cardiomyocytes, ventricular Pluricytes and atrial Pluricytes) differed with regard to ion channel expression (HCN4, electrophysiology (capacitance, APD90, fast inward current amplitude and fast inward current density)
  Therefore, we compared the percentage of positive cells for each ion channel and evaluated the differences in CT values and electrophysiology parameters between beating and non-beating cells within one cell group
 As comparisons were done within each cell group, CT values (and not CT values) were used for pairwise statistical testing
 The results of this analysis are listed in Table

 ;    No statistically significant differences in CT values can be observed between beating and non-beating cells within one cell group, except for CACNA1D: In iCell cardiomyocytes, non-beating cells showed a significantly smaller CT value (higher expression) than their beating counterpart
 Percentage of positive cells is comparable between beating and non-beating cells of all three cell groups investigated for HCN4, KCNJ4, SCN5A and KCNH
 The percentage of CACNA1G- and CACNA1D- positive cells is higher in beating compared to non-beating iCell cardiomyocytes and atrial Pluricytes
 Moreover, in atrial Pluricytes, the percentage of positive cells for KCNJ2 and CACNA1C is slightly higher in beating cells
 In ventricular Pluricytes, the percentage of positive cells for KCNA5 is higher in non-beating cells
 Regarding capacitance and faster inward current amplitude and a longer APD
 In addition, ventricular Pluricytes show a higher fast inward current amplitude, density and upstroke velocity compared We constructed histograms to visualize the distribution of single-cell data (see Figure 5 and SuppFigure )
 Earlier publications claimed that 54% or 64% of iCell cardiomyocytes have ventricular-like action potentials, 22% or 18% have nodal-like action potentials, and 24% or 18% have atrial-like action potentials (according to Ma et al, 2011 or Yonemizu et al, 2019, due to the assumed sub-populations
 To test the hypothesis that histograms should reveal cardiac subpopulations, we first pooled our expression data (CT) of atrial and ventricular primary human cardiomyocytes and asked whether the histograms would allow the discrimination of the primary subtypes (Figure 5a and b)
 Figure 5 shows histograms for CT of KCNA
 It is known that KCNA5 (Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily A Member 5, KV
5, conducting IKur) is predominantly expressed in primary atrial cardiomyocytes as compared to their ventricular counterpart (Kane & Terracciano, )
 Figure 5a demonstrates that the two subpopulations can be recognized as long as data sets are separated (see Figure 5a: cardiomyocytes)
 However, when the two data sets are pooled (Figure 5b), differences between atrial and ventricular primary cardiomyocytes are too small to be resolved (for our number of investigated cells)
 Therefore, we do not anticipate that histograms of expression data from (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 For primary ventricular cardiomyocytes, capacitance correlates with the fast inward Correlating expression parameters (CT values) against each other revealed strong and highly significant, positive correlations for many parameter pairs
 This holds true for all five investigated cell groups  hiPSC-CMs as well as primary cardiomyocytes
 Representative correlations are shown in SuppFigure 2, for details see SuppTable 2 - SuppTable

3 Correlation of CT of SCN5A and fast inward current amplitude in A question of specific interest was whether expression and electrophysiological parameters correlated on a single-cell level, or, more general, whether the investigated transcriptomic phenotype can be related to the electrophysiological phenotype of individual cells

 ;    In the following section, the results for the different electrophysiological parameters together with ion channel expression results related to the respective parameter are discussed one after another
 Moreover, we discuss the comparison of beating and non-beating hiPSC-CMs and whether histograms of single-cell parameters allow conclusions on possible subpopulations or whether single-cell phenotypes of hiPSC-CMs could be categorized into primary cardiac subtypes (nodal, atrial, and ventricular)
 Finally, we give implications for use
 cardiomyocytes and primary adult atrial human cardiomyocytes were investigated using a single-cell patch-clamp-RT-qPCR technique
 As this method is technically challenging, it was not always possible to determine every parameter for every single cell
 Therefore, n may vary subsequent RT-qPCR analysis, it is important to work quickly to minimize RNA loss capacitance, APD90 and upstroke velocity of the action potential, spontaneous beat rate, inter-beat interval, fast inward current amplitude, and fast inward current density of single cells
 We showed in iCell cardiomyocytes that the fast inward current is mainly conducted by the cardiac sodium channel (NaV
5, SCN5A, see SuppFigure a)
 For the subsequent expression analysis, the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing would have had the advantage of obtaining the whole transcriptome of single cells
 However, in a previous study, we failed to detect ion channel transcripts using this method (Schmid et al, )
 As other studies demonstrated that single-cell RT-qPCR is sensitive enough to detect ion channel expression (Burridge et al, 2014; Liang et al, 2013), we chose to employ this approach
 With this method, we were able to detect ion channel transcripts but needed to limit (technical reasons: limited material in single cells) the transcripts of interest to nine important cardiac ion channel subunits (HCN4, CACNA1G, CACNA1D, KCNA5, KCNJ4, SCN5A, KCNJ2, CACNA1D and KCNH)
 These ion channels were selected due to their anticipated relation to the determined electrophysiological parameters and/or due to their anticipated cardiac subtype associated expression (see introduction)

 ;    Reliability and robustness of single-cell qPCR-data is indicated by highly similar CT values of technical duplicates (see SuppFigure 3d), demonstration of a high inter-plate reproducibility (see SuppFigure 3b) and reflection of cDNA dilutions in CT values (see SuppFigure d)
 Further technical details that strengthen the reliability of the single-cell RT-qPCR data are the application of sequence-specific taqman assays (which span introns whenever possible) and the reduction of risk for contamination by a one-tube-protocol without the need for mRNA-a non-template-negative control
 However, limitations that come along with this RT-qPCR approach are that we only assess expression of certain ion channel subunits on the transcriptomic level, which may not reflect functional ion currents and the complex and regulatory mechanisms, ion distributions, etc
 )
 The patch-clamp rig on the one hand enabled single-cell electrophysiology measurements and harvesting of single cells, on the other hand it needs to be kept in mind that singularizing of cardiomyocytes and the selection of single cells may influence results (Du, Hellen, Kane, & Terracciano, 2015; Kane, Du, Hellen, & Terracciano, )
 However, we observed a correlation between the mean single-cell RT-qPCR data and bulk-sequencing data of iCell cardiomyocytes (see SuppFigure c)
 In general, electrophysiological data are hard to compare between studies because of different protocols and experimental conditions
 The interpretation of the single-cell correlations was challenging because of the complex data set (18 x 18 parameters), and the risk of indirect correlations
 The aim of our study was to present a transcriptional and electrophysiological snapshot of widely used cardiomyocyte models at an age when the cells are commonly used for cardiac safety assessment of novel drugs
 Limitations that come along with this study design are that generated hiPSC-CM results are only valid for iCell and Pluricyte cardiomyocytes at the described age and cannot be transferred to hiPSC-CMs in general, as hiPSC-CMs seem to be highly variable depending on e
 g
 donor, culture conditions or age (Biendarra-Tiegs, Secreto, & Nelson, )
 Thus, to provide the most comprehensive comparison for the iCell cardiomyocyte data, we primarily refer to the Ma et al, 2011 publication which systematically investigated various cardiac ion channel and currents

 ;    Singularizing/isolation of single cells from heart tissue), did not turn out to be influential co-variables for the investigated parameters
 This is in line with a correlation between bulk data (cells were lysed after two weeks in culture) and mean single-cell RT-qPCR data (see When working with single cardiomyocytes, we visually observed an immense variation of cell sizes
 Moreover, we observed - in accordance with previous publications - that hiPSC-CMs are small (Karakikes et al, 2015), i
 e
 smaller than adult primary human cardiomyocytes
 In fact, the mean capacitance of iCell cardiomyocytes, ventricular Pluricytes and atrial Pluricytes was comparable ( 20-25 pF) and smaller than the mean capacitance of primary human ventricular cardiomyocytes ( 123 pF)
 This finding is in agreement with earlier reports (see collected data of human cardiomyocytes in (Polak & Fijorek, 2012) and data for hiPSC-CMs (Mann et al, )
 Ventricular Pluricytes showed a slightly higher capacitance than atrial Pluricytes
 This trend was also reported in other ventricular and atrial hiPSC-CMs (Cyganek et al, 2018; Pei et al, 2017; Zhang et al, )
 The high standard deviation reported in our study for all cell types is in accordance with the observed morphological heterogeneity in cell size
 Regarding single-cell correlations, many CT values of the investigated ion channel genes were found to inversely correlate with capacitance
 This suggests that the single-cell expression depends on cell size
 This trend is mainly seen in hiPSC-CMs
 A plausible explanation could be that hiPSC-CMs (which are rather round and flat) have an active membrane surface area (and therefore capacitance) that correlates with cell volume compared to primary cardiomyocytes which exhibit a considerable membrane surface area enlargement due to the T-tubular system
 The spontaneous firing of action potentials is a specific feature of pacemaker cardiomyocytes, like nodal cardiomyocytes from the sinoatrial (SA)/atrioventricular node
 A critical difference between hiPSC-CMs and human primary atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes is the spontaneous beating behavior of hiPSC-CMs
 For a high percentage of single hiPSC-CMs, spontaneous beating was observed

 ;    we observed a mean spontaneous beat rate (beating and non-beating cells were included in calculation of mean beat rate) of  20-44 bpm, with iCell cardiomyocytes showing a significantly higher beat rate than ventricular Pluricytes
 Our findings with single cells are comparable to those previously reported for hiPSC-CM monolayers: In multi-electrode array (MEA) experiments, iCell cardiomyocyte monolayers showed a spontaneous beat rate of 45 bpm and ventricular Pluricytes of 13 bpm  (Rast et al, )
 Moreover, atrial Pluricytes showed a significantly higher spontaneous beating frequency than ventricular Pluricytes, which is in line with findings from other atrial/ventricular hiPSC-CMs (Cyganek et al, 2018; Pei et al, )
 Notably, values of beating frequency change slightly when the mean beat rate/inter-beat interval is calculated only for the beating cells
 Taking this into consideration, ventricular Pluricytes still show the slowest beat rate/highest inter-beat interval One likely mechanism contributing to the automaticity of hiPSC-CMs and nodal cardiomyocytes is the substantial presence of the depolarizing funny pacemaker current (If) in combination with no/low levels of IK1, an inwardly rectifier potassium current which stabilizes resting membrane potential of adult human primary atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes (Goversen et al, 2018; Verkerk et al, )
 Therefore, we assessed the expression of ion channels that are responsible for If (HCN4, Hyperpolarization Activated Cyclic Nucleotide Gated Potassium Channel 4,) and IK1 (KCNJ2: Kir 
1, Potassium Channel, Inwardly Rectifying Subfamily J, Member 2 and KCNJ4: Kir 
3, Primary cardiomyocyte electrophysiology data show that If is substantially present in nodal cardiomyocytes, low in atrial cardiomyocytes and absent in ventricular cardiomyocytes, and HCN expression is high in nodal, medium in atrial cardiomyocytes and low/absent in human adult ventricular cardiomyocytes (see review by Kane & Terracciano, 2017 As HCN4 expression is linked to pacemaker physiology, it would be an obvious conclusion that HCN4 could be used as nodal marker, for example to select nodal-like hiPSC-CMs
 However, our results indicate that HCN4 expression on transcriptomic level is not specific for nodal cardiomyocytes
 Interestingly, we found that almost every single cardiomyocyte investigated is positive for HCN4, including human primary ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes
 In line with that, a previous publication (Yechikov et al, 2016) showed that HCN4 is expressed on protein level in 90-92% of the single hiPSC-CMs investigated: Although immunostaining of HCN4 disappeared with time in culture and downregulation of HCN
 Other publications report an If current in iCell cardiomyocytes (Ma et al, 2011) and in the majority of primary human ventricular cardiomyocytes  (Cerbai et al, )

 ;    differences are found between the five cell groups assessed in the current investigation, with human primary ventricular cardiomyocytes showing the highest mean CT (lowest expression), atrial Pluricytes (lowest mean CT/highest expression)
 In summary, CT values for primary human ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes were higher than for hiPSC-CMs, indicating a Besides HCN4, we investigated the expression of KCNJ2 (Kir 
1) and KCNJ4 (Kir
3), the ion channel subunits responsible for the conduction of the IK1 current
 Whether KCNJ2 is the predominant form in primary ventricular cardiomyocytes and KCNJ4 expression is higher in primary atrial cardiomyocytes (Bartos et al, 2015), or whether there are similar expression levels of KCNJ2 and KCNJ4 in atrium and ventricle (rdg et al, 2006) is reported inconsistently in literature
 We observed the following trends in our results: KCNJ2 shows a higher expression (regarding percentage of positive cells and CT) in primary ventricular cardiomyocytes than in primary atrial cardiomyocytes (significantly higher mean CT than primary ventricular cardiomyocytes, atrial and ventricular Pluricytes)
 This trend also holds true for Pluricytes: While mean CT is comparable between ventricular and atrial Pluricytes, the percentage of positive cells is higher (93%) in ventricular Pluricytes than in atrial Pluricytes (%)
 iCell cardiomyocytes show, compared to the other two hiPSC-CM groups, a similar CT value but the lowest percentage of positive cells
 KCNJ4 transcripts are detected at similar levels in a majority of primary ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes
 CT values are comparable between the cell groups investigated except for the iCell cardiomyocytes which show a significantly lower mean CT (higher expression, in line to the functional presence of IK1 in iCell cardiomyocytes (Ma et al, ))
 However, the percentage of positive cells in hiPSC-CMs is lower than in primary cardiomyocytes, with the lowest number of positive cells in atrial Pluricytes
 Our findings agree with a reported higher expression of KCNJ2 and KCNJ4 in ventricular hiPSC-CMs than in atrial hiPSC-CMs (Cyganek et al, )
 Although a missing/low IK1 is assumed to contribute to the automaticity in hiPSC-CMs, we could detect transcripts of KCNJ2 and KCNJ
 It is difficult to estimate the influence of the two parameters (percentage of positive cells and CT) on the total expression level, making it difficult to (regarding percentage of positive cells and CT) between ventricular Pluricytes and primary ventricular cardiomyocytes could lead, together with highest CT for HCN4 (when considering hiPSC-CMs) in ventricular Pluricytes, to a slower spontaneous beat rate compared to beat rates (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    of iCell cardiomyocytes and atrial Pluricytes
 This tendency is in accordance with the To gain further insight into the beating behavior of hiPSC-CMs, we focused on single-cell correlations regarding beat rate and on the comparison of beating and non-beating cells
 Despite the association of HCN4, KCNJ2, and KCNJ4 with beat rate and inter-beat interval, no correlation between these parameters could be established on the single-cell level; neither did we find differences between beating and non-beating cells regarding these three channels
 Notably, in a previous study, HCN4 expression on protein level was found to correlate with beating frequency following 40 days in culture and correlation became weaker following 60 days (Yechikov et al, )
 Still, for iCell cardiomyocytes, a correlation of beat rate with could be established
 In the heart, both channels show higher expression in nodal and atrial cells and have low/no expression in primary ventricular cardiomyocytes (Kane & Terracciano, )
 Moreover, both channels are assumed to be involved in nodal automaticity (Baig et al, 2011; Mesirca et al, )
 This indicates that for iCell cardiomyocytes, these cardiomyocytes, beat rate correlates inversely with the fast inward current amplitude (which correlates positively with CT of SCN5A and inversely with upstroke velocity), for ventricular Pluricytes beat rate correlates positively with upstroke velocity (which in turn correlates with the fast inward current amplitude and density) and for atrial Pluricytes, beat rate correlates significantly and inversely with the CT of SCN5A (which correlates inversely with the fast inward current amplitude)
 These correlations may indicate a role of the fast inward current (sodium current) for pacemaking in hiPSC-CMs
 In primary nodal cardiomyocytes of the central SA node, expression of SCN5A is low/absent (Chandler et al, 2009; Kane & Terracciano, 2017) and therefore INa cannot contribute to pacemaking in these cells
 In addition, we observed that beating ventricular Pluricytes have a significantly larger fast inward current amplitude and density and a steeper upstroke velocity (these trends are also seen in iCell cardiomyocytes)
 In line with these findings, a previous study reported a prominent INa current in single hESC-derived cardiomyocytes, the inhibition of spontaneous contractions by TTX and concluded that INa/NaV
5 has a prominent role in the generation of spontaneous action potentials in these cells (Satin et al, )
 Apart from that, comparing beating and non-beating cells within one cell group revealed only few differences in transcriptional and electrophysiological parameters
 While some differences do not show an obvious relation to pacemaking mechanisms or to nodal attributes, others would comply with the hypothesis that (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    beating hiPSC-CMs are more nodal-like because the spontaneous contractions are an obvious evidence for the cells ability to spontaneously generate action potentials (e
 g
, higher percentage of CACNA1D- and CACNA1G- positive iCell cardiomyocytes and atrial Pluricytes in beating compared to non-beating cells)
 Some correlations are at odds with this hypothesis (e
 g
, non-beating iCell cardiomyocytes show a significantly smaller CT of CACNA1D value (higher expression), a smaller capacitance and shorter APD90 than their beating counterpart)
  In summary, our investigation regarding beating behavior and pacemaking of hiPSC-CMs revealed a complex picture and interpretation of results is challenging
 On the one hand pacemaking per se is a complex process, presumably involving not only If and IK1 (e
 g
 the so-called calcium clock (Lakatta, Maltsev, & Vinogradova, ))
 On the other hand, investigation of beating behavior of hiPSC-CMs is complicated by the variable beating behavior of single hiPSC-CMs
 We even observed that hiPSC-CMs switched between beating and non-beating states
 Such behavior may indicate that pacemaking in hiPSC-CMs is a highly complex process that involves not only the expression of certain ion channel subunit transcripts but also metabolic and other mechanisms)
 It is important to note that the beat rate determined in the current study only reflects a snapshot of the beating behavior prior to patch clamp recordings
 If absence of automaticity was temporary, no transcriptional differences would be expected
 Moreover, we also found non-beating hiPSC-CMs generating spontaneous action potentials in our study
 The fact that non-beating cells can produce spontaneous action potentials is an indication that mechanical processes also needed to be considered
 A high percentage of hiPSC-CMs has the ability to spontaneously generate action potentials, which only becomes visible for those hiPSC-CMs in which an action potential is followed by a contraction
 In some cells and/or in certain periods an action potential may not lead to a contraction
 The fact that the contractile apparatus of hiPSC-CMs differs from that of primary adult human cardiomyocytes In addition to capacitance and spontaneous beat rate, we also determined the action potential duration of single cardiomyocytes
 We found that the mean APD90 of iCell cardiomyocytes (219 ms) and ventricular Pluricytes (271 ms) are comparable while the mean APD90 of atrial Pluricytes (40 ms) and primary ventricular cardiomyocytes (110 ms) were significantly shorter

 ;    were reported in previous studies (Cyganek et al, )
 When compared to published data of primary atrial cardiomyocytes (200/400 ms; (Kane & Terracciano, 2017)), the mean APD90 of atrial Pluricytes in our study is considered smaller
 Moreover, the mean APD90 for iCell cardiomyocytes and ventricular Pluricytes are in the range of previously reported hiPSC-CM APD90 data (123  548 ms; (Barbuti et al, )
 Nevertheless, also the mean APD90 of iCell cardiomyocytes reported in our study is shorter than the APD90 of iCell cardiomyocytes reported previously (Barbuti et al, 2016; Hortigon-Vinagre et al, )
 This trend continues in primary ventricular cardiomyocytes: The mean APD90 in our study (110 ms) is shorter than reviewed in the Kane et al publication (250/440 ms, see (Kane & Terracciano, ))
 Another publication also reported slightly shorter APDs for atrial (150 ms) and ventricular (172 ms) tissue (Goodrow et al, )
 In addition to the morphological heterogeneity of single hiPSC-CMs, we also observed a huge variation in action potential duration of single hiPSC-CMs (see Figure 1, Table )
 Interestingly, the standard deviation of APD90 was also high for primary ventricular cardiomyocytes
 While very long (>500 ms) action potentials were only recorded with iCell cardiomyocytes and ventricular Pluricytes, very short (<50 ms) action potentials were recorded for every cell type we investigated
 Overall, we found shorter mean action potential durations and higher variations compared to literature
 The relatively high percentage of very short action potentials (cells had a healthy visual appearance and no obviously shifted resting potential) lowered mean APD90 and increased heterogeneity
 There are many possible reasons for short action potentials
 One may be opening of KATP channels under metabolic stress / ATP decline (Faivre & Findlay, 1990; Findlay, Deroubaix, Guiraudou, & Coraboeuf, )
 Action potentials in the present study were measured right after opening the cell to avoid mRNA loss
 However, it is a common procedure in pharmacological experiments to allow the action potential to stabilize before initiation of recording
 Our  approach may have been too fast to allow ATP to diffuse from the pipette internal solution into the cell, to close KATP channels, and to level out inter-cell variability
 Such shortcoming of our approach may explain the discrepancy between our results and published data
 Other possible explanations for the observed heterogeneity may be the usage of singularized cells (it has been shown that density of cells can affect AP morphology and duration (Du et al, 2015)) and that we did not preselect cells to perform recordings
 Exploration of computational models of action potential may help to get mechanistic insight into ionic currents involved in very short action potentials
  Since duration of the action potential can be influenced with pharmacological modulation of L-type calcium (ICaL) and hERG (IKr) currents (Rast et al, 2016), we investigated whether APD90 differences between the cell types and the heterogeneity of single cells within one cell type (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    could be explained by different expression of CACNA1C (the gene for the L-type calcium current ICaL conducting subunit CaV
2) and/or KCNH2 (the gene for the IKr conducting subunit Kv
1, hERG)
 In agreement with published data  (Kane & Terracciano, 2017), we found almost every single cardiomyocyte to be positive for CACNA1C and KCNH
 Primary cardiomyocytes show higher CT values (lower expression) than hiPSC-CMs
 This agrees with levels for KCNH2 and CACNA1C  respectively, than the human heart (Kodama et al, )
  Moreover, it was reported that IKr was recorded in every iCell cardiomyocyte investigated (current densities close to values for primary cardiomyocytes) and that current densities of ICaL were larger than for primary human cardiomyocytes (Ma et al, )
 Despite the significant contribution of IKr and ICaL to APD90, correlation analysis didnt show a relationship between APD90 and CACNA1C or KCNH2 on the single-cell level
 This lack of correlation can be due to the complex regulation of ion channels
 For example, ICaL function is known to be regulated by calcium- and voltage-dependent inactivation (Lee, Marban, & Tsien, 1985) and protein kinase A (Pallien & Klussmann, 2020), indicating that regulation  of ion currents is a highly complex process which cannot be simplified by assessment of the transcription of ion channel subunits
 Moreover, the duration of an action potential is influenced by many other ionic currents and transcripts of just two ion channels may not be sufficient to explain this parameter
 Next, we investigated the upstroke velocity of the action potential, the fast inward current amplitude and its density
 A mean upstroke velocity of 310 V/s for primary ventricular cardiomyocytes is in line with reported data (200-300 V/s according to (Kane & Terracciano, 2017)), while our values for hiPSC-CMs (Ventricular Pluricytes (404 V/s), iCell cardiomyocytes (340 V/s) and atrial Pluricytes (208 V/s)) are higher than those reported previously (9-115 V/s according to (Barbuti et al, ))
 The fast inward current was detected in every cell we investigated
 Atrial Pluricytes (-
55 nA) and primary ventricular cardiomyocytes (-

 ;    external solutions and electrophysiological protocols
 Notably, our values are higher than in other reports (according to reviewed data in (Barbuti et al, 2016): 
2 -310 pA/pF), maybe due to our negative holding potential (-100 mV) and the physiological sodium concentration (137 mM)
 Taken this into consideration, we estimate that currents we recorded in the current study are rather under- than over-estimated (technical limitations due to the amplifier technology)
 Additionally, high standard deviation values occurred in our study can be due to performance of recordings without prior selection of cells
 In a previous study, a INa density of -
7 pA/pF was recorded in iCell cardiomyocytes, which may be underestimated due to measurements in small cells (mean capacitance of 
8 pF) and under reduced sodium concentration (Ma et al, )
  Moreover, a previous study also reports INa in  almost every hiPSC-CM (93%) (Malan, Friedrichs, Fleischmann, & Sasse, )
 In line with finding the fast inward current in every cell, every cell investigated was positive for SCNA5 (Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Alpha Subunit 5, NaV
5 conducting INa)
 The CT values were comparable between the cell groups except for one pair: Ventricular Pluricytes showed a significantly lower mean CT (higher expression) than primary ventricular cardiomyocytes
 In line with that, literature also reports high and comparable expression of SCN5A in atrium and ventricle (Kane & Terracciano, 2017; rdg et al, 2006) and another study showed comparable SCN5A expression between the human heart and iCell cardiomyocytes in bulk RT-qPCR experiments (Kodama et al, )
 The reliability of our findings is strengthened by the positive correlation of SCN5A with the fast inward current amplitude and by the inverse correlation of the fast inward current amplitude and density with the upstroke velocity of the action potential for all three hiPSC-CM groups
 Thus, in this case, ion channel subunit transcripts seem to translate to electrophysiological measurements
 In line with these findings, another study reported a TTX-dependent upstroke of the action potential in iCell The ion channel transcripts investigated using the single-cell RT-qPCR approach were chosen due to estimated functional relations to electrophysiological parameters and due to assumed differential expression in primary cardiac subtypes
 Different types of cardiomyocytes exist in the adult heart (nodal, atrial and ventricular cells), assuming different function, gene expression, morphology and electrophysiology
 Commonly accepted attributes of the prototypes that are of interest for us are depicted in figure 1 in (Kane & Terracciano, )

5, conducting IKur) shows high expression in atrial cardiomyocytes, but it is associated with low expression/absence in the other cardiac cell types (Kane & Terracciano, )
 Thus, we compared the expression of these three channels in human atrial primary cardiomyocytes and atrial Pluricytes demonstrated a higher percentage of and CACNA1D are smaller in the three hiPSC-CM groups, indicating a higher expression of these pacemaking-related ion channels (Baig et al, 2011; Mesirca et al, 2014) compared to the two primary cell groups
 In line with literature (Kane & Terracciano, 2017), KCNA5 shows highest expression in atrial primary cardiomyocytes and atrial Pluricytes, having significantly lower mean CT values than every other group and exhibiting a high percentage of positive cells
 However, KCNA5 is also expressed in a relatively high percentage of primary ventricular cardiomyocytes but with a higher mean CT, indicating a lower expression level as compared to atrial cardiomyocytes
 Other studies also reported the presence of KCNA5 in human ventricular tissue, but with a higher abundance in the atria (rdg et al, )
 Moreover, in accordance with our results, the abundance of KCNA5 on the protein level  but without functional current - was reported earlier for primary ventricular cardiomyocytes (Ravens & Cerbai, )
 Our results for CACNA1G, CACNA1D and KCNA5 in atrial and ventricular Pluricytes reflect a trend for chamber-specificity regarding certain ion channels and highlight While ventricular and atrial Pluricytes are thought to represent two different cardiomyocyte subtypes, iCell cardiomyocytes are claimed  to be a mixture of nodal-, atrial-, and ventricular-characterization of iCell cardiomyocytes showed that iCell cardiomyocytes display 54% - 64% ventricular-like action potentials, 18% - 22% nodal-like action potentials, and 18% - 24% atrial-like action potentials (Ma et al, 2011; Yonemizu et al, )

 ;    subpopulations in histograms of expression data
 However, this approach turned out not to be suitable, as it did not allow discrimination of subpopulations for pooled primary atrial and ventricular data
 An explanation could be that the number of cells needs to be increased in our experiments or that CT values of the investigated targets are not suitable to dissect cardiac subtypes
 Further work is needed to clarify this point
 Answering the question about the composition of hiPSC-CM populations is of particular interest, since it is still unclear whether Cardiomyocytes Users Guide
, 2017; Ma et al, 2011; Yonemizu et al, 2019), other studies indicated that single pluripotent stem cell derived-cardiomyocytes rather show multiple or even a broad spectrum of action potential phenotypes (Ben-Ari et al, 2016; Du et al, 2015; Gorospe et al, 2014; Kane et al, )
 From a transcriptomic point of view, our failure to dissect distinct hiPSC-CM subpopulations associated with subtypes in a previous single-cell RNA-As distributions of single-cell parameters did not allow conclusions on possible subpopulations in iCell cardiomyocytes, we next focused on the single-cell hiPSC-CM phenotypes (e
 g
, the combination of electrophysiological and transcriptomic attributes in single cells)
 A potential and simple outcome of this study could have been to find distinct single-cell phenotypes of the prototypical cardiac subtypes in the iCell cardiomyocyte culture
 According to common sense, we would have expected to find nodal-like hiPSC-CMs that beat spontaneously with relatively short action potential and slow upstroke velocity, without a fast inward current and no expression of SCN5A, KCNJ2 or KCNJ4 but being strongly positive for HCN4, CACNA1G and CACNAD
 Moreover, we would have expected to find atrial-like hiPSC-CMs without spontaneous beating, with longer action potential, faster upstroke velocity and a prominent fast inward current and strong expression of KCNA
 In addition, we also expected a prototypical ventricular-like hiPSC-CM to be present in the iCell cardiomyocyte culture with the following characteristics: no spontaneous beating, long action potential, a steep upstroke, prominent fast inward current, no expression of HCN4, CANCA1G and CACNA1D but positive for SCN5A, KCNH2 and KCNJ
 Yet, we could not identify these distinct cardiac-subtype related subpopulations, but we recognized a high percentage of cells with an interesting combination of the investigated parameters
 The majority of hiPSC-CMs of all three investigated groups (iCell cardiomyocytes, ventricular and atrial Pluricytes) was beating spontaneously (i
 e
 able to spontaneously generate action potentials) and was positive for HCN4 (at a higher mean (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    expression level compared to primary atrial or ventricular cardiomyocytes)
 The same cells also demonstrated a prominent fast inward current that is mainly driven by INa, (SuppFigure 3a) and steep action potential upstroke and were positive for SCNA
 While spontaneous generation of action potentials and a high HCN4 expression are clearly nodal-related pacemaking attributes, the presence of a prominent INa-driven fast inward current, fast upstroke velocity and a high expression of SCN5A are not nodal (but are clearly associated with attributes of adult atrial and ventricular primary cardiomyocytes (Kane & Terracciano, )
 A previous case report found a large inward current with characteristics of INa in two out of a total of three human SA node cells analyzed with recording conditions similar to the ones used in the current study (Verkerk, Wilders, van Borren, & Tan, )
  Considering that expression of SCNA/NaV
5 on the transcript/protein level is restricted to the peripheral SA node (Chandler et al, 2009), the two cells in this small sample showing INa-like current might rather have been isolated from the peripheral region of the SA node than from its central region
 Thus, an interpretation of the observed single-cell phenotype of a majority of hiPSC-CMs is that these cells combine In summary, our results with hiPSC-CMs not only agree with previously published literature, but the multi-parameter single-cell approach we employed helps us to further complement and strengthen our knowledge of hiPSC-CMs
 Our findings correlate well with the characterization of iCell cardiomyocytes model as reported by Ma et al, 2011: Spontaneous beating, upstroke
 In contrast to our interpretation, Ma et al concluded that iCell cardiomyocytes represent immature cells (which retained pacemaking properties) with nodal-, atrial- and ventricular-like action potentials
 The expression of HCN4 in hiPSC-CMs may be seen as immature feature (Spter et al, )
 Since we did not evaluate primary human embryonic cardiomyocytes and assessment of changes in hiPSC-CM characteristics over time is outside the scope of the current study, we cannot conclude on the developmental status of the cells we investigated
 Nevertheless, the question of whether hiPSC-CMs can either be seen as immature or neither resemble adult nor fetal primary cardiomyocytes remains to be resolved (e
 g
, differences in global gene expression has been reported between human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes/hiPSC-CMs and both, fetal and adult cardiomyocytes (Gupta et al, (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    The fact that the majority of hiPSC-CMs combine nodal and non-nodal attributes may lead to paced cells
 For example, it has been published that hiPSC-CMs show an interdependence of repolarization and spontaneous beat rate in MEA experiments (Rast et al, )
 One potential contributing factor to this phenomenon suggested by the authors of the study is that hiPSC-CMs may have mixed attributes of nodal and ventricular cardiomyocytes
 Our results support the hypothesis that the majority of hiPSC-CMs exhibit a mixed cardiac phenotype (combination of nodal and non-nodal attributes) as opposed to have distinct nodal and ventricular cells in the Despite very long action potentials being only recorded in hiPSC-CMs, both hiPSC-CMs heterogeneity may cause problems when using the cells for detection of drug-induced changes on action potential duration in a low-throughput assay (usually resulting in small sample sizes) like manual patch-clamp
 In this case, selection criteria (use of cells within a defined APD range) or increase of sample size using a higher throughput platform could help to reliably detect changes in action potential duration despite the high basal heterogeneity
   Effects of research substances on individual cardiac ionic currents are typically evaluated in heterologous expression systems
 To make an assessment in a more realistic physiological environment than in an immortalized cell line, hiPSC-CMs might also be of interest for the analysis of individual cardiac ion currents
 As every single hiPSC-CM investigated in this study showed a fast inward current and expression of SCN5A, they are considered a suitable model system for evaluation of effects on the NaV
5 target
 The strong expression of CACNA1C and KCNH2/hERG in almost every cell also indicates that iCell cardiomyocytes and Pluricytes can The situation is more difficult when the parameter of interest is likely to depend on the integration of multiple ionic currents, like the beat rate and APD
 When comparing such integrative parameters, the expression pattern of all relevant ion channels should be comparable, e
 g
 between hiPSC-CMs and primary cardiomyocytes
 While the distributions of SCN5A and KCNH2 seem indeed comparable, a clear shift to the left (higher expression) can be observed (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 ;    SuppFigure )
 This indicates that the spontaneous depolarization, which impacts the beat rate, upstroke of the action potential and therefore indirectly the action potential duration of some individual hiPSC-CMs might be driven by a combination of If (HCN4), different calcium currents (CACNA1C, CACNA1D, CACNA1G) and INa (SCNA)
 This combination would not be expected in primary central SA nodal, atrial or ventricular cells (Kane & Terracciano, )
 Therefore, drug-induced changes of integrative parameters, need to be interpreted with the caveat that a set of ion channels different from the expected physiological one might contribute to these parameters in the hiPSC-CM model system being used
 A previous case report even describes the presence of a non-cardiac ion channel current in individual batches of hiPSC-CMs (Horvth et al, )
 Thus, for the analysis of integrative parameters, primary cardiomyocytes At the beginning of the experiments for this study, our working hypothesis was that a binary presentation of single-cell expression data (Figure 3) would reveal clear, homogeneous and cardiomyocytes
 Such presentation should have allowed to derive conclusions on the patterns and both positive and negative cells were seen with every target except SCN5A and KCNH2 within one cell group
 This points out a certain level of heterogeneity within the five investigated cardiac cell groups, also within primary atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, maybe indicating that in addition to prototypical primary nodal, atrial, and ventricular cells, a broad spectrum of overlapping cardiac cell phenotypes can be found in the heart (Kane & Terracciano, )
 Moreover, although we expected subtype-specific expression of HCN4 (see section 
 
2) and KCNA5 (see section 
 
5), our single-cell data indicate that the discrimination of primary atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes in a binary transcriptomic analysis for these two ion channels is not as clear-cut as expected
 Taken together, the ion channel targets we assessed in the current study are not specific for a certain subtype in a (binary) transcriptomic fashion and therefore are not suitable as markers to identify a specific cardiac subtype in a hiPSC-CM culture (if it exists at all  see section 
 
 
 )
 However, the average expression on a population level (Table 3, Figure 4) shows a trend for KCNJ2 for atrial and ventricular Pluricytes when compared to their expression in primary atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes
 Such trend indicates the potential to derive more chamber-like (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
