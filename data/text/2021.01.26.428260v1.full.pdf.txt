 One sentence of summary: Deficiency of the transcription factor HNF1A biases islet endocrine cell fate towards a-cells, impairs intracellular calcium homeostasis and insulin exocytosis, alters the stoichiometry of insulin to C-peptide release, and leads to an accumulation of abnormal insulin Abstract: Mutations in HNF1A cause Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young type 3 (MODY3), the most prevalent form of monogenic diabetes
 We generated stem cell-derived pancreatic endocrine cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with induced hypomorphic mutations in HNFA
 Using these cells, we show that HNF1A orchestrates a transcriptional program required for distinct aspects of -cell fate and function
 During islet cell differentiation, HNF1A deficiency biases islet endocrine cells towards an a-cell fate associated with PAX4 down-regulation
 HNFA-deficient -cells display impaired basal and glucose stimulated-insulin secretion in association with a reduction in CACNA1A and intracellular calcium levels, and impaired insulin granule exocytosis in association with SYT13 down-regulation
 Knockout of PAX4, CACNA1A and SYT13 reproduce the relevant phenotypes
 Reduction of insulin secretion is associated with accumulation of enlarged secretory granules, and altered stoichiometry of secreted insulin to C-peptide
 In HNF1A deficient -cells, glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea drug used in the treatment of MODY3 patients, increases intracellular calcium to levels beyond those achieved by glucose, and restores C-peptide and insulin secretion to a normal stoichiometric ratio
 To study HNF1A deficiency in the context of a human disease model, we also generated stem cell-derived pancreatic endocrine cells from two MODY3 patients induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
 While insulin secretion defects are constitutive in cells with complete HNF1A loss of function, -cells heterozygous for hypomorphic HNF1A mutations are initially normal, but lose the ability to secrete insulin and acquire abnormal stoichiometric secretion ratios
 Importantly, the defects observed in these stem cell models are also seen in circulating proportions of insulin:C-peptide in nine MODY3 patients
  Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an autosomal dominant form of diabetes with onset typically before the age of 25 years accounting for 1-2% of diabetes incidence ()
 There are at least 11 (2) genetically distinct types of MODY, due to derangements in -cell development or function
 MODY3 is caused by mutations in the transcription factor HNF1A (3, 4) and accounts for 63% of diagnosed instances of MODY ()
 MODY3 patients have normal glucose tolerance during childhood and early adult life, but show progressive reduction of insulin secretion in response to glucose (-)
 Glycemia typically increases over time, resulting in the need for treatment with the insulin secretory sulfonylurea drugs
 Eventually, 30-40% of patients become HNF1A is a 631-amino acid transcription factor with three major domains: dimerization, DNA-binding, and transactivation
 Over 200 HNF1A diabetes-related mutations have been identified  in all major ethnic groups (10) and the DNA-binding domain has the highest frequency of mutation in MODY3 patients ()
 Understanding the role of HNF1A gene and the pathophysiology of MODY3 has been difficult because of the difficulty in studying human islets or mass with these mutations
 Mouse models of HNF1A deficiency do not accurately mimic patient phenotypes ()
  Stem cell-derived -cells provide a useful model system, and have been used to study -cell development in humans (12, 13) and to recapitulate disease phenotypes (14, )
 Differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to pancreatic endocrine cells can be achieved by a multistep protocol resulting in islet-like clusters containing all endocrine cell types (-)
 Transplanting these islet-like clusters into mice allows functional testing of stem cell-derived -cells (sc-cells) in vivo (19, )
 Here we show that human stem cell-based models of HNF1A deficiency shows islet developmental bias towards a-cells, altered insulin granule morphology and the stoichiometry of insulin:C-peptide secretion in vitro and in vivo
 We used these models to identify disordered calcium homeostasis and glucose-mediated exocytosis as key mechanisms accounting for the secretory defects observed
 This study was designed using two cell-based models: Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines null for HNF1A in Fig
 1-5 and Fig
 S1-S10; and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with MODY3 patient-specific mutations in Fig
 6 and Fig
 S-S
 Measurements of circulating hormones in nine MODY3 patients are presented in Fig

 Generation of isogenic cell lines with HNF1A mutations in hESCs and MODY3 iPSCs To elucidate the cellular functions of HNF1A, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate hESC lines (Mel1) harboring non-naturally occurring heterozygous and homozygous null mutations
 The Mel1 hESC line has a INSGFP/wt and GAPDHLuciferase/wt dual-reporter containing a GFP gene knockin in place of a coding INS locus, and a luciferase knockin in one GAPDH locus ()
 GFP expression under the control of the insulin promoter does not alter b-cell function in mice (22) and does not cause ER-stress in human scb-like-cells ()
 This marker enables imaging and isolation of viable INS-GFP+ cells in vitro and in vivo
 We designed short guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to introduce indel mutations in the DNA-binding domain (exon 3) of the HNF1A gene (Fig
 S2A and Table S1) because the DNA-binding domain has the highest frequency of mutation in MODY3 patients ()
 Transfection of hESC lines with Cas9-GFP and sgRNAs #12 or #14, followed by sorting for GFP (Fig
 S2B), achieved 
3 and 
4% indel efficiency for the sgRNAs as shown by surveyor assay (Fig
 SC)
 Gene editing was efficient, resulting in compound heterozygous knockouts and heterozygous mutations (Fig
 S2D) with no off-target mutations detected through targeted sequencing (Table S)
 Heterozygous (hESC HNF1A Het) and compound heterozygous-null mutant cell lines (hESC HNF1A KO1 and KO2) with different indels in exon 3 and premature protein termination were chosen for further studies (Fig
 SE)
 hESC HNF1A Het, KO1 and KO2 lines retained the HNF1A dimerization domain (truncated HNF1A), while hESC HNF1A KO3 line was mutated at the start codon, deleting the entire HNF1A protein (Fig
 SE)
 To understand the consequences of MODY3 patient-specific heterozygous mutations, we also generated iPSC lines from MODY3 patient fibroblasts containing heterozygous mutations in the DNA-binding domain (MODY3 iPSC Het: +/RQ)
 The R200Q variant has been previously associated with MODY3 (24); however, the precise effect of this missense mutation on HNF1A function is unknown, but very likely pathogenic ()
 Using CRISPR/Cas9, we corrected the R200Q mutation from MODY3 iPSC Het (Fig
 S2F) with an efficiency of 
9% (5 clones out of 63) to generate isogenic wildtype cells
 In addition to the hESC knockout lines, we also generated iPSCs compound heterozygous knockout lines with an efficiency of 
9% (27 clones out of 63) (Fig
 SD)
 An iPSC line with a deletion of the WT allele, but intact patients mutation (MODY3 iPSC: R200Q/-) was chosen for further studies (Fig
 SG)
 We also introduced the same R200Q mutation into both alleles in the hESC line (hESC Hom: R200Q/R200Q) (Fig
 S2H) with an efficiency of 
8% (5 clones out of 24) (Fig
 SI)
 All genetically manipulated cell lines (Fig
 S2J) resulted in modified versions of HNF1A protein (Fig
 S2K and S2L) and had a normal karyotype (Fig
 S2M and S2N) and no off-target mutations (Table S)
  To determine the functional consequences of HNF1A deficiency, the first part of this study will focus on the hESC model
 Stem cells were differentiated into the pancreatic lineage using a published differentiation protocol (20) (Fig
 SA)
 Differentiation of wildtype stem cells using this protocol consistently generated 82% PDX+/NKX
1+ cells at the pancreatic progenitor stage (day )
 At the endocrine stage (day 27), we obtained 45% PDX1+/CPEP+ cells with 60% of them co-expressing NKX
1 (scb-like cells), 30% GCG+ cells (sca-like cells) and 10% SST+ cells (sc-To determine the timing of HNF1A expression, we performed qPCR at different stages of differentiation
 Insulin mRNA was detected at the endocrine stage (day 20) (Fig
 S3C), whereas HNF1A mRNA is first detected at low levels at the primitive gut tube stage (day 5), increased at the pancreatic progenitor stage (day 11) and increased further at the endocrine stage (day 27) (Fig
 S3D), identifying the stages where lack of HNF1A could have developmental and/or functional consequences
 HNF1A knockout resulted in significant reduction of HNF1A transcript at the endocrine stage (Fig
 S3E); HNF1A protein was detected in hESC WT, but was absent in hESC Mutations in HNF1A did not affect hESC lines in generating definitive endoderm cells (SOX17+) at day 3 of differentiation or pancreatic progenitor cells (PDX+/NKX
1+) at day 11 of differentiation as determined by immunohistochemistry (Fig
 SG)
 At the endocrine stage of development (day 27), cell clusters or organoids were morphologically indistinguishable
 hESC lines became positive for INS-GFP fluorescence due to the INSGFP/wt reporter; there was no differences in GFP expression by genotype (Fig
 SH)
 HNF1A KO cells were capable of differentiation to all islet endocrine cell types, including PDX+/NKX
1+/SYP+/CPEP+ cells (scb-like cells), GCG+ cells (sca-like cells) and SST+ cells (sc-like cells) (Fig
 1A and S3I-S3K) indicating that HNF1A is not required to generate pancreatic endocrine cells
 No differences were found for PDX1 and NKX
1 in hESC HNF1A WT and HNF1A KO endocrine cells (day 27) by immunohistochemistry (Fig
 S3J and S3K) and flow cytometry (Fig
 SL)
 The ability of HNF1A KO cells to differentiate to all endocrine cell types enabled the comparison of transcriptional HNF1A deficiency impairs a network of genes required for calcium signaling, glucose-To determine the transcriptional consequences of HNF1A deficiency in sc-cells, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing was performed in INS-GFP sorted -like cells derived from hESC HNF1A KO and WT lines in vitro
 Volcano plot analysis of bulk RNA sequencing identified 30 up-regulated genes and 148 down-regulated genes, including HNF1A in hESC HNF1A KO -like cells (Fig
 1B and Table S)
 Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that hESC HNF1A KO -like cells segregated from hESC HNF1A WT -like cells based on their gene expression profile by principal component analysis (Fig
 1C), and volcano plot analysis (Fig
 1D) revealed previously undescribed HNF1A target genes involved in intracellular calcium signaling (CACNA1A, S100A6 secretion (RFX6, DPEP1, DPP4 and IAPP) (Fig
 1E) as commonly downregulated with bulk RNA sequencing from HNF1A KO sc-like cells
 Among the up-regulated genes in hESC HNF1A KO -like cells, we found genes involved in synaptic vesicle cycle (AP2A2, SH3KBP1 and HSPA1B) To understand the transcriptional consequences of HNF1A mutation in other endocrine cell types, we analyzed all single cells within the islet-like clusters, allowing the segregation of cell types according to single-cell gene expression
 In addition to HNF1A KO lines, an hESC line included
 Using clustering analysis from those cells, we grouped the cells into thirteen different cell type populations (Fig
 S4A and SB)
 To cluster different endocrine cells, we used the expression of endocrine cell markers such as SYP, INS, GCG and SST (Fig
 S4C) and pancreatic progenitor markers NKX
1, PDX1, MAFA and HNF1A (Fig
 S4D) from all cell lines
 This allowed the identification of insulin expressing cells (cluster 0) and glucagon expressing cells (cluster 2) (Fig
 F)
 From the population of insulin expressing cells (cluster 0), cells defined by high insulin and low glucagon expression were considered sc-like cells and were compared between Separation into populations according to these markers enabled us to identify differentially expressed genes in HNF1A mutant cells affecting specific endocrine cell types
 In sc-like cells, a total of 73 genes were differentially expressed between HNF1A WT, homozygous R200Q and KO lines (Fig
 1G and Table S)
 Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in sc-like cells insulin secretion and synaptic vesicle cycle (Fig
 SB)
 Furthermore, several MODY genes (RFX6, PAX4 and NEUROD1) were down-regulated (Fig
 G)
 These transcription factors are known to be important for the functional identity of adult pancreatic -cells (25, )
 We also identified LLGL2) in hESC HNF1A mutated -like cells (Fig
 1I and Table S5) (25, 27, )
 Among the up-regulated genes, we found genes involved in synaptic vesicle cycle (RAB3A and VAMP2) (Fig
 1G and Table S)
 RFX6, KCNH6, S100A6, A1CF, DPEP1 and DPP4 were the most consistently downregulated genes in hESC HNF1A mutated -like cells
 In addition to those genes, SYT13, CACNA1A and PAX4 were down-regulated in the sc-like-cell subpopulation (Fig
 H)
 Similar to our study, a recent case study of cadaveric human islets of a MODY3 patient (+/T260M) also found down-regulation of RFX6, CACNA1H, IAPP and TMEM37 in -cells, and down-regulation of CACNA1A, RFX6, PCBD1 and PPP1R1A in a-cells ()
 These genes are required for calcium To determine the molecular consequences of HNF1A deficiency in other endocrine cell types, we analyzed mono-hormonal sca-like cells (cluster 2a), characterized by high glucagon and low insulin expression (Fig
 S5C and SD)
 We identified up-regulated genes involved in glucagon signaling pathways (PKM, CALM1 and CALM2) and down-regulated genes involved in insulin (SYT7) and -cell dedifferentiation (GC) (30) (Fig
 S5E and SF)
 Furthermore, in bi-hormonal cells expressing both insulin and glucagon, PYY was down-regulated, while GCG was up-regulated (Fig
 S5G and S5H) in HNF1A mutated lines, indicating a transcriptional bias of endocrine cells A recent publication by Cardenas-Diaz et al (31) identifies LINC01139 as an HNF1A target implicated in -cell dedifferentiation and -cell respiration
 However, we found no significant difference in the expression of this long non-coding RNA between WT and HNF1A mutated (hESC Het, hESC Hom R200Q/R200Q, hESC KO or iPSC MODY3 Het +/460ins) -like (Fig
 S5I-5K) and a-like cells (hESC Hom R200Q/R200Q and hESC KO) (Fig
 SL)
 Similar results were reported in cadaveric human -cells from non-diabetic donors as compared to one MODY3 In summary, HNF1A orchestrates a network of genes promoting endocrine differentiation to -cells, and in differentiated -cells regulates genes involved in calcium signaling, hormone Downregulation of genes involved in adult -cell identity (PAX4 and RFX6) with transcriptional bias towards the a-cell fate in HNF1A KO cells point to a developmental role of HNFA
 Though both hESC HNF1A KO and WT cells gave rise to similar numbers of insulin positive cells (Fig
 S6A and S6B), immunostaining showed a variable increase in sca-like cell numbers from 30% to up to 70% in the hESC HNF1A KO line (Fig
 2A and SB)
 This was confirmed by a significant increase in GCG+/CPEP+ cell type ratio by immunohistochemistry (Fig
 2B) and glucagon content by ELISA (Fig
 C)
 Furthermore, quantification by flow cytometry consistently showed a significant increase in sca-like cells in three different hESC HNF1A KO lines as compared to hESC HNF1A WT lines (Fig
 S6C and SD)
 The absolute increase in sca-like cells in hESC HNF1A KO cells was driven by an increase in the number of bi-hormonal (56% in KO vs
 20% in WT) and mono-hormonal (7% vs
 1%) sca-like cells as shown by flow cytometry (Fig
 2D), immunohistochemistry (Fig
 S6E), and RNA sequencing (Fig
 SF)
 Transcriptional analysis by single-cell RNA sequencing of glucagon and insulin double hormone-positive cells showed an increase in glucagon gene expression and a decrease in insulin gene expression in hESC HNF1A KO cells compared to WT cells (Fig
 E)
 These findings are consistent with PAX4 repressing pancreatic glucagon gene expression (32), and indicate that HNF1A hypomorphism affects endocrine cell fate by increasing expression of the glucagon gene in pancreatic endocrine cells
 HNF1A deficiency did not affect the proportion of sc-like cell fate as shown by flow cytometry (Fig
 S6G and SH)
 No effects of HNF1A mutations on proliferation (Fig
 S6I) or survival (Fig
 S6J and S6K) of scb-like cells were observed by flow cytometry
 These results show that HNF1A In order to assess the developmental requirements of HNF1A in endocrine cells in vivo, we transplanted pancreatic islet-like clusters derived from hESC HNF1A WT and hESC HNF1A KO lines with GAPDHLuciferase/wt and INSGFP/wt dual-reporter ()
 Mice received ~180 clusters of stem cell-derived islet-like cells (Fig
 S7A) containing similar amount of CPEP/PDX1 positive cells across genotypes (Fig
 S7B and S7C); but with different amounts of bihormonal GCG/CPEP positive cells (Fig
 D)
 Cell Transplantation was done by injection into the ventral and medial muscle groups of the left quadriceps in NOD SCID gamma immunodeficient mice (NSG mice) (Fig
 F)
 The skeletal muscle was chosen for its dense vasculature and easy access for surgical procedures
 Skeletal muscle has been used for other endocrine transplants, including for rate ()
 Analysis of engraftment efficiency was evaluated by bioluminescence intensity (BLI) several weeks post-transplantation
 Mice with successful engraftment showed a two-fold increase in BLI 4 to 6 weeks post transplantation, while those with failed engraftment showed a decrease (Fig
 SD)
 Transplantation was successful in 79% (31/39) of mice, independent of HNF1A genotype (Fig
 SE)
 
5% (49/53) of mice transplanted with hESC lines remained teratoma-free (Fig
 SF)
 In those mice, the graft explant (30 weeks post-transplantation) (Fig
 S7G) was a vascularized tissue of about ~220 mg (Fig
 SH)
 According to luminescence intensity, there was a gradual increase in BLI from week 0 to 30 post-transplantation without significant differences by HNF1A genotype (Fig
 G)
 Grafts remained localized for up to 50 weeks post-transplantation, and in no case (0/39) was luminescence detected in an ectopic location
 These results show that skeletal muscle is a stable and suitable transplantation site for SC-derived islet-like cells
  of scb-mass as determined by GFP fluorescence did not differ by HNF1A genotype (Fig
 2H-2I and SI-SJ)
 The presence of exclusively mono-hormonal endocrine cells, including scb-cells (CPEP+/PDX+/NKX
1+), as well as glucagon- and somatostatin-positive cells were apparent in both hESC HNF1A WT and hESC HNF1A KO grafts (Fig
 J)
 No double hormone-positive cells were identified in cells of either genotype
 Consistent with the in vitro studies, the percentage of sca-cells in HNF1A KO compared to HNF1A WT islet-like structures were increased by 24% (Fig
 2K and S7K), leading to a significant increase in GCG+/CPEP+ cell type ratio (Fig
 2L); similar results as found in cadaveric human islets of a MODY3 donor (+/T260M) (29) (Fig
 K)
 Consistent with this observation, ex vivo analysis of isolated hESC HNF1A KO grafts showed an increase in glucagon protein content by ELISA (Fig
 2M and SL-SM)
 Glucagon secretion was higher in hESC HNF1A KO grafts when stimulated with glibenclamide, a second-generation sulfonylurea drug compared to hESC HNF1A WT grafts (Fig
 N)
 Similarly, elevated glucagon secretion upon KCl stimulation was detected in vitro from hESC HNF1A KO-derived endocrine cells (Fig
 SN)
 These results point not only to a gain of a-cell number, but also enhanced a-cell function due to HNF1A deficiency
 This is consistent with the up-regulation of genes (PKM, CALM1 and CALM2) involved in glucagon signaling pathways in sca-like cells
  To determine whether the downregulation of PAX4 seen in HNF1A mutant cells (Fig
 1H) could reproduce the bias towards the a-cells, we generated hESC PAX4 KO cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 (Fig
 SO)
 The PAX4 gene is an essential gene for differentiation of insulin-producing b-cells in the mammalian pancreas ()
 Knockout of PAX4 in rabbits induces a decreased in number of b-cells and increased number of a-cells (26), whereas overexpression of PAX4 reduces glucagon expression in differentiating hESCs ()
 Endocrine cells differentiated from an hESC PAX4 KO line were characterized by significant decrease in scb-like cells compared to hESC WT and HNF1A KO lines
 In the hESC PAX4 KO lines, sca-like cells were increased to levels similar to hESC HNF1A KO cells by immunohistochemistry (Fig
 2O) and flow cytometry (Fig
 SP)
 Therefore, in HNF1A KO lines, down-regulation of PAX4 and de-repression of glucagon gene are associated with the developmental bias towards a-cell fate
  In summary, HNF1A is not required for development of mono-hormonal endocrine cells (a-, b and -cells)
 But restriction of HNF1A activity increases the number and proportion of a-cells in association with PAX4 downregulation
 As HNF1A clearly regulates a network of genes, a role of To determine the consequences of HNF1A deficiency on -cell function, we measured glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
 hESC HNF1A KO scb-like cells had reduced basal insulin secretion (Fig
 S8A) and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion compared to WT scb-like cells and compared to human pancreatic islets in vitro (Fig
 A)
 These differences in hormone secretion between HNF1A mutant and HNF1A WT sc-like cells were not due to a reduction in insulin content (Fig
 SB)
 In contrast to glucose, treatment with the insulin secretagogues, tolbutamide or potassium chloride resulted in insulin secretion in hESC HNF1A KO cells comparable to hESC HNF1A WT b-like cells (Fig
 B)
 Thus, membrane depolarization enables recruitment of an insulin granule reservoir that is abnormally retained in HNF1A mutant b-cells and fails to be secreted in response to glucose
 The ability of sulfonylureas in releasing insulin from -cell granules is consistent with the clinical efficacy of sulfonylurea drugs in MODY
 These defects are likely intrinsic to the b-cell, and not due to paracrine effects of glucagon ()
 As calcium signaling is a mechanism for the release of insulin through granule exocytosis, we measured intracellular calcium levels in dispersed scb-like cells in vitro
 Both genotypes had glucose-stimulated calcium responses (Fig
 C)
 However, hESC HNF1A KO b-like cells had significantly lower calcium levels relative to hESC HNF1A WT scb-like cells as measured by Fura-2 fluorescence (Fig
 C)
 This was further supported by measurements of absolute intracellular calcium concentrations by Fura-2 fluorescence (Fig
 D)
 Among the HNF1A target genes, reduced expression of CACNA1A is potentially involved in reducing intracellular calcium levels, and SYT13 may be required for efficient exocytosis-mediated insulin secretion
 CACNA1A encodes a voltage-dependent calcium channel mediating the entry of calcium into excitable cells and is involved in calcium-dependent insulin secretion and type 2 diabetes ()
 Synaptotagmins are calcium sensors localized in the -cell insulin granules, and are required for vesicle fusion and glucose-stimulated insulin release (-)
 SYT13 is a member of the synaptotagmin family and is predicted to be involved in calcium-regulated exocytosis
 SYT13 is down-regulated in human T2D islets and silencing of SYT13 impairs insulin secretion in INS1-832/13 cells ()
 To determine whether down-regulation of CACNA1A and SYT13 seen in HNF1A mutant cells (Fig
 1H) secretion, we generated hESC CACNA1A KO and SYT13 KO cell lines using CRISPR/Cas
 Sanger sequencing revealed homozygous mutations resulting in frame shifts (Fig
 SC)
 Differentiation of hESC CACNA1A KO and hESC SYT13 KO generated INS-GFP organoids (Fig
 3E) comprised of ~51% PDX1/CPEP and ~16% GCG positive cells (Fig
 3F and S8D) with no differences compared to isogenic WT cells
 Dispersed hESC CACNA1A KO b-like cells (Fig
 S8E) had significantly reduced intracellular calcium levels compared to hESC WT cells (Fig
 3G and SF)
 The reduction of intracellular calcium in hESC CACNA1A KO was intermediate to hESC HNF1A KO cells, indicating that CACNA1A is not the only gene affecting intracellular calcium levels in hESC HNF1A KO cells
 Intracellular calcium levels in SYT13 KO where unchanged compared to WT cells (Fig
 3G and SF)
 Reduced basal and stimulated insulin secretion were observed in both hESC CACNA1A KO and hESC SYT13 KO scb-like cells at intermediate levels to HNF1A KO scb-like cells (Fig
 H)
 Treatment with tolbutamide or KCl stimulated insulin secretion in all KO lines comparable to the corresponding WT lines
 Impairments in insulin release due to reduced levels of these molecules can be overcome by elevating calcium beyond physiological levels using tolbutamide or KCl
 The milder phenotypes of cells deficient for single target genes compared to HNF1A KO cells suggests that the combined effects on several HNF1A To interrogate the function of hESC HNF1A KO b-cells in vivo, we monitored circulating human insulin and C-peptide concentrations in euglycemic mice transplanted with sc-islet-like clusters
 By 4 weeks post-transplantation, plasma human C-peptide concentrations were significantly lower in mice transplanted with hESC HNF1A KO b-cells compared to hESC HNF1A WT b-cells (Fig
 A)
 Circulating human C-peptide concentrations in mice transplanted with hESC HNF1A WT -cells increased over time, reaching human physiological levels (652146 pM) 24-30 weeks post-transplantation
 In mice transplanted with hESC HNF1A KO b-cells, plasma human C-peptide concentrations increased to a maximum of 352142 pM at 30 weeks post-transplantation (Fig
 A)
 In mice transplanted with hESC HNF1A WT b-cells, human insulin was detected as early as transplanted with hESC HNF1A KO b-cells had virtually undetectable plasma human insulin concentration for 30 weeks (Fig
 4B) despite high plasma human C-peptide levels (>300 pM)
 These differences in hormone secretion between HNF1A mutant and HNF1A WT sc-cells were not due to reduced sc-cell mass in vivo (Fig
 I)
 These findings in vivo led us to quantify the secretion ratio of those hormones in scb-cells in vitro
 For equivalent secretion of human C-peptide at basal glucose condition (Fig
 S8G), secretion of human insulin was significantly reduced in hESC HNF1A KO lines (Fig
 S8H), leading to decreased insulin:C-peptide secretion ratios in vitro (Fig
 SI)
 Thus, the absence of insulin in the plasma was not a limitation of the sensitivity of the assay but a defect in the stoichiometry of insulin to C-peptide in circulation
 While plasma of mice grafted with hESC HNF1A WT b-cells consistently showed an insulin:C-peptide molar ratio of 
 
11 from week 4 to 30 post-transplantation, mice grafted with hESC HNF1A KO -cells had an 18-fold lower ratio (Fig
 C)
 This decrease in circulating insulin:C-peptide ratio was reciprocal to a 3-fold increase in the insulin:C-peptide ratio of intracellular content from hESC HNF1A KO isolated grafts (Fig
 4D), demonstrating complementary imbalance of insulin to C-peptide
 The altered insulin:C-peptide ratio was not due to differences in insulin processing since insulin:proinsulin ratios in hESC HNF1A KO and hESC HNF1A WT grafts were identical in vivo (Fig
 4E) and in vitro (Fig
 S8J-S8L) and no differences were found in the transcript levels of processing genes (PC1/PC3) in RNA sequencing analysis (Table S-S)
 Impaired stoichiometry of circulating insulin to C-peptide was also observed in mice transplanted with two additional homozygous mutant hESC lines (Fig
 SM)
 Therefore, HNF1A deficiency not only impairs insulin secretion, but also the stoichiometry of circulating insulin to C-peptide ratios
  tolerance test (iPGTT) in transplanted mice
 During fasting and following an iPGTT, mice transplanted with hESC HNF1A WT -cells displayed normal human insulin and C-peptide secretion profiles (Fig
 F-H)
 In contrast, hESC HNF1A KO -cells were non-responsive to glucose: plasma human C-peptide was not decreased by fasting and did not increase after glucose injection with concentrations significantly lower than in mice transplanted with hESC HNF1A WT -cells (Fig
 G)
 Remarkably, circulating human insulin remained undetectable in animals engrafted with hESC HNF1A KO -cells despite high plasma levels of human C-peptide (Fig
 H)
 released in a constitutive manner independent of metabolic state, resulting in an altered ratio of In contrast to glucose, intra-peritoneal injection of the sulfonylurea drug, glibenclamide, in mice transplanted with hESC HNF1A KO -cells showed a significant increase in C-peptide 10 minutes after glibenclamide injection (Fig
 I)
 Surprisingly, human insulin concentrations in mice transplanted with hESC HNF1A KO -cells increased from undetectable levels to 1421 mU/L, reaching levels comparable to those in the control group (Fig
 J)
 Insulin:C-peptide ratios in plasma of animals transplanted with hESC HNF1A KO -cells were increased 10-fold by glibenclamide, equal to the ratios in mice transplanted with hESC HNF1A WT -cells (Fig
 K)
 Clearance of insulin from the circulation occurred with the same kinetics in mice grafted with hESC HNF1A WT and hESC HNF1A KO -cells 20 minutes after glibenclamide administration (Fig
 4K), excluding insulin stability or clearance in plasma as the cause for the low insulin levels in mice transplanted with HNF1A mutant sc-cells
 To further test whether the reduced insulin:C-peptide secretion ratios from hESC HNF1A KO -cells were due to secretory defects and not insulin stability or clearance, we isolated the hESC HNF1A KO grafts from mice and identified a significant decrease in insulin:C-peptide secretion ratios compared to HNF1A WT grafts ex vivo
 This ratio was restored after exposure of the grafts to glibenclamide (Fig
 L)
  Thus, membrane depolarization initiated by closure of the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels (target of glibenclamide) and high intracellular calcium levels allow the secretion of insulin To identify the basis of the insulin secretory defect in hESC HNF1A KO -cells we examined insulin granule morphology by electron microscopy from 30-week explants of normoglycemic mice
 hESC HNF1A WT grafts were comprised of sc-cells with a characteristic high-electron density core separated from limiting membranes by a halo (Fig
 5A and SA)
 These morphologies are consistent with electron microscopy of normal human -cells
 In contrast, hESC HNF1A KO islets-like were comprised of sc-cells where the majority (>90%) of the insulin granules were abnormally enlarged (Fig
 5A-5C) with a diffuse electron-light insulin core (Fig
 5D-5E and S9A), characteristic of immature secretory granules
 Enlarged insulin granules were further confirmed by immunogold staining for human C-peptide (Fig
 F)
 Similar results were observed in vitro, where hESC HNF1A mutated cells had increased insulin granule diameter with a diffuse light insulin core (Fig
 S9B and SC)
 For sca-cells, no differences in morphology, structure or granule size between HNF1A genotypes was seen (Fig
 SD)
 While these abnormal insulin granules are not secreted in response to glucose, they can be secreted in response to sulfonylureas
 These results show that HNF1A is required for normal insulin granule formation HNF1A deficient sc-cells are unable to maintain glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice To test the ability of hESC HNF1A KO -cells to maintain in vivo normoglycemia, endogenous murine -cells were ablated by the administration of streptozotocin (STZ) 22 weeks post-transplantation
 STZ is a drug that, by virtue of species-related difference in glucose transporters, specifically targets murine -cells without affecting human -cells ()
 We first confirmed that HNF1A deficiency did not increase sensitivity of human cells to STZ
 There was no change in cell death (Fig
 S10A) or C-peptide secretion (Fig
 S10B) when HNF1A WT or KO sc-like-cells were exposed to STZ in vitro
 In vivo, circulating plasma human C-peptide from mice transplanted with HNF1A WT or HNF1A KO cells was unchanged or increased post STZ treatment (Fig
 G)
 Mouse C-peptide was undetectable by ELISA (Fig
 S10C) and immunohistochemistry of the pancreas (Fig
 S10D) demonstrating successful and specific ablation of mouse -cells
 Mice transplanted with the hESC HNF1A WT -cells were normoglycemic (~100 mg/dl and HbA1C ~5%) for at least 10 weeks post STZ injection (Fig
 5H and S10E) and had normal human insulin and C-peptide secretion profiles during an iPGTT (Fig
 SF-SH)
 In contrast, mice transplanted with hESC HNF1A KO -cells did not increase human C-peptide secretion (Fig
 5G) after becoming severely diabetic (blood glucose >500 mg/dl) within one week following STZ injection (Fig
 H)
 Consistent with in vitro studies, hESC HNF1A KO -cells are unresponsive to blood glucose even at high levels, failing to maintain systemic glucose homeostasis in a mouse model of -cell HNF1A R200Q homozygous mutation is pathogenic and causes a developmental bias These studies demonstrate the molecular, cellular and functional consequences of complete HNF1A deficiency, a situation that does not occur clinically, but was created experimentally to amplify the effects of HNFIA functional hypomorphism in order to enable mechanistic studies
 MODY3 patients are heterozygous for the causal HNF1A alleles; to more directly characterize the isogenic mutation-corrected MODY3 iPSC lines (R200Q corrected: WT) and hESC HNF1A Het line into endocrine cells
 Heterozygous mutations in HNF1A did not affect the generation of definitive endoderm cells (SOX17+) at day 3 of differentiation or pancreatic progenitor cells (PDX+/NKX
1+) at day 11 of differentiation compared to WT lines as determined by immunohistochemistry (Fig
 SA)
 At the endocrine stage (day 27), cell clusters or organoids were morphologically indistinguishable and all heterozygous cell lines differentiated efficiently to all pancreatic endocrine cells (sca-, scb- and sc-like cells) and scb-like cells co-expressed PDX/NKX
1/HNF1A (Fig
 SB)
 HNF1A protein was detected in WT, MODY3 R200Q Het (+/R200Q) and MODY3 R200Q-corrected WT (+/+) iPSC-derived endocrine cells by western blot (Fig
 SC)
 In contrast to HNF1A truncated lines, the heterozygous point mutation R200Q of MODY3 iPSC line did not affect the total amount of HNF1A protein, suggesting that the mutant R200Q protein was produced (Fig
 SC)
 No significant differences were found in endocrine cell types (sca-, scb- and sc-like cells) between HNF1A WT and heterozygous cell lines at day 27 of To determine the consequences of heterozygosity for HNF1A in our MODY3 patient lines for the bias towards a-cell fate, we measured the percentage of glucagon cells co-expressing C-peptide in two MODY3 iPSC Het (+/460ins and +/R200Q) lines in vitro
 We found no significant differences between MODY3 iPSC lines and control iPSC R200Q-corrected WT lines (Fig
 SE)
 To determine the pathogenicity of the HNF1A R200Q mutation, we knocked out of the HNF1A wildtype allele in a MODY3 iPSC Het line (R200Q/-), which resulted in a significant ~70% increase in GCG and CPEP co-expressing cells compared to the R200Q-corrected WT control lines (Fig
 S11E and SF)
 We also detected a significant increase in the percentage of GCG and CPEP co-expressing cells in hESC HNF1A R200Q homozygous (R200Q/R200Q) and hESC HNF1A Het (+/-) lines compared to hESC WT (+/+) lines (Fig
 S11G and SH)
 Thus, while both heterozygous MODY3 patient cells (+/460ins and +/R200Q) show no developmental bias towards the a-cell fate, complete loss of HNF1A WT allele in MODY3 iPSC R200Q (R200Q/-) and hESC HNF1A R200Q homozygous (R200Q/R200Q) result in a stronger developmental bias towards a-cell fate, indicating the pathogenicity of R200Q mutation
 Interestingly, the hESC heterozygous line harboring a frameshift mutation in the DNA-binding domain and causing a premature stop codon presented a stronger bias towards a-cell fate
 Previous studies in MODY3 patients have shown that frameshift mutations in the DNA-binding domain cause dominant-negative effects affecting the DNA binding capacity of the normal HNF1A ()
 HNF1A haploinsufficiency gradually impairs sc-cell functional capacity in the context of In order to assess the developmental potential of MODY3 patient-specific mutations in vivo, we transplanted pancreatic islet-like clusters derived from iPSCs using identical methods as previously described
 While 
9% (51/58) of mice transplanted with isogenic MODY3 iPSC Het lines (+/R200Q) and R200Q-corrected WT (+/+) were teratoma-free; the majority (
5%, 8/13) of the MODY3 iPSC Het (460ins) and control iPSC WT lines showed teratoma formation (Fig
 SI)
 Because of variable teratoma formation among different iPSC lines (20), only teratoma-free mice were used for further analysis
 Teratoma-free transplanted mice had 
3% (35/52) animals (Fig
 S11J) and found no significant differences in glucagon-to-insulin content ratios or endocrine cell types between MODY3 iPSC Het (+/R200Q) and MODY3 iPSC R200Q-corrected WT (+/+) control grafts (Fig
 S11K and SL)
 These results are consistent with our iPSC in vitro results; however, a recent study from cadaveric MODY3 human islets with a T260M heterozygous mutation in DNA-binding domain (29), showed a bias of endocrine cells toward the a-cell fate (Fig
 K)
 The same phenotype was observed in hESC HNF1A heterozygous lines with frameshift mutation in the DNA-binding domain (Fig
 SH)
 Mutations affecting the DNA-binding domain or truncating mutations are associated with earlier onset of diabetes in MODY3 patients ()
 Thus, different mutations affect HNF1A function to different degrees, resulting in different phenotypes in patients as well as in cellular phenotypes in a stem cell system
  To understand the function of MODY3 iPSC Het b-cells in a physiological context, we monitored circulating human insulin and C-peptide in transplanted euglycemic mice over 30 weeks
 Mice two, four, eight (Fig
 S12A) and thirty weeks post transplantation (Fig
 S12B) with undetectable human insulin (Fig
 SC)
 Since human insulin levels are under the minimal threshold limit for detection by ELISA, this deficiency can be attributable to the lower ability of these mutant iPSCs to generate functional insulin producing cells in vivo
 In mice transplanted with iPSC-derived cells from MODY3 patient (+/R200Q) and R200Q-corrected WT (+/+) isogenic lines, circulating human C-peptide (Fig
 S12B) and human insulin (Fig
 S12C) concentrations reached similar levels 30 weeks post-transplantation
 Transplantation of mice with hESC HNF1A Het (+/-) and hESC HNF1A R200Q homozygous (R200Q/R200Q) line resulted in low circulating concentrations of human C-peptide over thirty weeks post transplantation (Fig
 S12A and S12B) with low to undetectable human insulin in hESC HNF1A Het (+/-) and hESC HNF1A Hom (R200Q/R200Q) as compared to WT lines (Fig
 S12C), thus affecting insulin:C-peptide secretion ratios
 These results show that HNF1A heterozygous frameshift mutations in the DNA-binding domain (hESC +/-) and HNF1A R200Q homozygosity (hESC R200Q/R200Q) are pathogenic and that in the heterozygous point mutations (iPSC +/R200Q), it is less detrimental to b-cell function
 To further interrogate the consequence of the R200Q mutation in b-cells function and evaluate (iPGTT) in mice transplanted with the MODY3 isogenic lines (R200Q Het and R200Q-corrected WT), as these iPSC lines allowed the reliable generation of transplanted mice with high C-peptide and insulin levels over thirty weeks post transplantation (Fig
 S12D and SE)
 During an iPGTT, mice transplanted with both isogenic lines showed comparable changes in blood glucose (Fig
 S12F) and plasma human C-peptide (Fig
 6A); plasma human insulin concentrations dropped below detection during fasting and increased upon glucose injection (Fig
 6B), demonstrating concentrations in both genotypes (Fig
 S12G and S12H) at equivalent ratios (Fig
 SI)
 No significant differences in insulin secretion (Fig
 S12J) or endocrine hormone content were found in vitro or in vivo between genotypes (Fig
 S12K and SL)
  MODY3 patients generally display normal glucose tolerance during early childhood and exhibit symptomatic diabetes only in their late teens or early adulthood (9) depending on the type and position of the HNF1A mutation (44), indicating that progression of the disease occurs over several years and potentially involves metabolic stressors
 To determine whether there are functional WT (+/+) sc-cells, we treated mice with STZ, thereby exposing transplanted sc-cells to higher insulin demand due to ablation of mouse endogenous -cells
 Two weeks post STZ, animals transplanted with MODY3 iPSC R200Q Het (+/R200Q) cells showed rapid progression to hyperglycemia (Fig
 C)
 The increase in blood glucose from those mice (n=9) was accompanied by a failure to increase circulating human C-peptide (Fig
 6D) and a significant reduction of human insulin levels (Fig
 6E) over 5-6 weeks after STZ treatment
 In contrast, in mice (n=6) transplanted with isogenic MODY3 iPSC R200Q-corrected WT cells (+/+), concentrations of human plasma Five to six weeks post STZ treatment, we found that the ratio of circulating insulin to C-peptide fell by 55% in mice transplanted with MODY3 iPSC R200Q Het (+/R200Q) cells
 In contrast, WT (+/+) cells (Fig
 F)
 The decrease in circulating insulin:C-peptide ratios was reciprocal to a significant increase by 74% in the insulin:C-peptide ratios of intracellular content from isolated HNF1A mutated grafts compared to isogenic controls (Fig
 6G), demonstrating complementary imbalance of insulin to C-peptide secreted
 These results show that HNF1A R200Q gene correction of the R200Q mutation protects MODY3 iPSC -cells from acquiring this We then performed iPGTTs two, four, six and eight weeks post STZ administration
 MODY3 iPSC secretion: mild at two weeks post STZ (Fig
 S13A and S13B) and completely unresponsive insulin release to glucose challenges four weeks post STZ (Fig
 S13C and SD)
 Mice transplanted with MODY3 sc-cells fail to clear glucose from the circulation during a glucose tolerance test at six to eight weeks post STZ treatment (Fig
 6H and SE)
 HNF1A R200Q heterozygous (+/R200Q) (+/+) sc-cells were sensitive to fasting, remained glucose responsive six to eight weeks post STZ treatment, and cleared glucose from circulation (Fig
 6H-6I and SE-SF)
 Mice transplanted with MODY3 iPSC R200Q Het (+/R200Q) sc-cells became diabetic as shown by elevated blood glucose (Fig
 S13G) and HbA1c levels (Fig
 6J) compared to control mice
 These results show that MODY3 iPSC -cells (+/R200Q) fail to compensate for higher insulin demands, and that the hyperglycemia is due to gradual development of insulin secretory defects, characterized by a disruption of the stoichiometry of insulin and constitutive C-peptide release
 Correction of R200Q mutations protects MODY3 iPSC -cells from acquiring these abnormal insulin secretion profiles
 MODY3 patients have low non-fasting insulin to C-peptide ratios in plasma To determine whether discordant concentrations of circulating insulin and C-peptide also occurred in MODY3 patients, we measured islet endocrine hormones in the plasma of nine MODY3 patients (Table S)
 MODY3 patients were divided into three therapeutic groups: no sulfonylurea treatment (5/9 patients); receiving sulfonylurea treatment (3/9 patients), and receiving Sitagliptin (GLP1 agonist) treatment (1/9 patients)
 In the group without sulfonylurea treatment, both MODY3 and MODY2 (hypomorphic mutations in glucokinase gene) patients had reduced non-fasting C-peptide levels in plasma compared to non-diabetic controls, 251133 pM and 28812 pM respectively (Fig
 A)
 However, only MODY3 patients had undetectable human insulin levels (0 pM) in circulation, as opposed to MODY2 (
2 pM) or non-diabetic controls (3524 pM) (Fig
 B)
 As in the stem cell model, this imbalance is apparent in an abnormal insulin:C-peptide secretion ratios in MODY3 patients (<
002) as opposed to normal ratios in MODY2 patients (
 
03) and non-diabetic controls (
 
03) (Fig
 C)
 In the group with sulfonylurea treatment, three MODY3 patients received glipizide
 Those patients had non-fasting C-peptide concentrations of 616301 pM (Fig
 7A) with circulating insulin of 2512 pM (Fig
 7B) and normal insulin:C-peptide ratios (Fig
 7C), comparable to non-diabetic subjects
 One MODY3 ratio in plasma comparable to that of the controls
 Patients who are insensitive to the insulinotropic effects of sulfonylureas, will respond clinically to GLP-1 agonists ()
 There are multiple mechanisms by which GLP1R agonists may affect -cell performance (46), and the findings in this subject are consistent with an effect of HNF1A deficiency on insulin secretory mechanisms that are glucose-dependent
 No differences were found in the concentrations of non-fasting plasma glucagon in MODY3 patients compared to non-diabetic subjects (Fig
 D)
 These results indicate that HNF1A, but not GCK mutations, affect the stoichiometry of circulating concentrations of insulin and C-peptide
 The clinical efficacy of sulfonylureas in releasing insulin from -cell granules and restoring normal insulin:C-peptide stoichiometry is consistent with our in vitro and in vivo studies of stem cell-derived islets, and with the clinical efficacy of sulfonylurea-type drugs in the treatment of MODY3 patients
 The clinical differences of circulating hormone concentrations in MODY3 patients are not necessarily due entirely to effects on secretion rates, and could reflect genotype-related differences in the hepatic and renal handling of these peptides
 However, genotype-specific stem cell-derived islets were grafted into genetically identical HNF1A (+/+) mice, and in those animals the alterations in the stoichiometry of circulating insulin and C-peptide are presumably determined solely by cell-autonomous characteristics of the grafted cells
   Here we report the use of stem cell-derived islets containing HNF1A mutations to elucidate the molecular basis for apparent -cell dysregulation of insulin secretion in HNF1A hESC null and MODY3 hypomorphic patient lines
 Based on in vitro and in vivo developmental, morphological and functional assessments of stem cell-derived islets, as well as measurements of plasma concentrations of insulin and C-peptide in nine MODY3 patients, we conclude that HNF1A regulates endocrine cell fate, normal -cell granule formation and function, including calcium-mediated exocytosis of insulin-containing granules, and the resultant stoichiometric secretion of Hypomorphic mutations in HNF1A perturb expression of genes important in -cell identity such as PAX4, leading to increases in glucagon gene expression, a-cell number and in the a:b-cell ratio in mature islets
 This phenotype was observed in homozygous hESC HNF1A knockouts, but was not seen in MODY3 patient iPSC-derived heterozygous cells (+/460ins and +/RQ)
 This increase was, however, reproduced in MODY3 patient iPSC- and hESC-derived cells rendered homozygous for R200Q (iPSC R200Q/- and in hESC R200Q/R200Q) indicating the pathogenicity of the R200Q allele
 The hESC HNF1A line heterozygous for a frameshift mutation in the DNA-binding domain also showed the a-cell bias phenotype
 Previous clinical studies in MODY3 patients have shown that the type and the position of HNF1A mutation is important in the timing of onset of the diabetic phenotype ()
 The differences in the severity of the phenotype is likely due to a dominant-negative effect of frameshift mutations in the DNA-binding domain
 Though DNA binding was not examined for the mutations studied here, previous studies have shown that effects affecting the DNA binding capacity of the normal HNF1A molecule (43), as the mutant HNF1A will bind to the normal HNF1A via the intact dimerization domain in the N-terminus
 A recent case study of cadaveric human islets from a 33-year old MODY3 patient (+/T260M mutation in the DNA-binding domain) with a 17-years history of diabetes also showed an increase compromised in association with a reduction in CACNA1A and intracellular calcium levels, and down-regulation of SYT13, a gene involved in calcium-regulated granule exocytosis
 We show that enabling insulin vesicle fusion and secretion from HNF1A mutant b-cells
 Consistent with this inference, the administration of sulfonylureas to MODY3 patients and mice transplanted with HNF1A knockout b-cells restores normal insulin secretion
 HNF1A knockout cells accumulate enlarged insulin granules with diffuse electron-light insulin cores, which can be recruited by Sulfonylureas may be stimulating release primarily from the more normal insulin granules and/or driving stoichiometric release of insulin and C-peptide from the enlarged, abnormal insulin granules
 These results may be relevant to more prevalent forms of diabetes, including type 2 diabetes, in which reduced proportions of mature insulin granules have also been reported (47, )
  Among some apparent HNF1A target genes, knockout of PAX4, CACNA1A and SYT13 partially reproduced phenotypes seen in HNF1A deficient cells
 As HNF1A orchestrates a network of genes involved at different aspects of -cell development and function (49), a contribution of additional target genes to these phenotypes is likely
 A recent report by Cardenas-Diaz et al (31) identified LINC01139 as an HNF1A target implicated in -cell dedifferentiation and mitochondrial function
 However, in a- or b-cells, we did not observe significant downregulation of LINC01139 in HNF1A The accumulation of abnormal insulin secretory granules in HNF1A knockout b-cells was associated with a loss of the 1:1 stoichiometric release of C-peptide and insulin from -cells, characterized by constitutive secretion of C-peptide, and intracellular retention of insulin
 Their equimolar secretion was restored by exposure of the cells to depolarization by sulfonylurea
 Previous studies have identified a constitutive-like secretory pathway that, in immature -cells, is characterized by accumulation of immature secretory granules that secrete newly synthesized C-peptide in molar excess of insulin (50, )
 The accumulation of abnormal insulin granules in HNF1A deficient -cells is apparently associated with an increase in insulin granule membrane remodeling, as a result of which C-peptide is diverted most likely to the constitutive-like secretion pathway, accounting for reduced insulin to C-peptide ratios detected in the plasma of MODY3 patients and mice transplanted with HNF1A hypomorphic islets
 Our data support this model, but more studies are necessary to validate this pathway and fully elucidate the contribution of secretory In cells with total HNF1A deficiency or knockout, uncoupling of C-peptide from insulin secretion is innate, while it is gradually acquired during progressive b-cell failure in heterozygous MODY3 patient cells
 Measurement of plasma C-peptide has been widely and productively used in the study and clinical management of patients with diabetes ()
 The observation in our study that C-peptide secretion can be dissociated from insulin secretion is clinically relevant when evaluating islet function in patients with MODY
 The ratio of insulin to C-peptide may actually be useful as a biomarker for progression of MODY3 and possibly other types of diabetes
  The insulin secretory phenotype of heterozygous MODY3 iPSC-derived b-cells was intermediate to that of cells with complete HNF1A deficiency
 MODY3 iPSC-derived heterozygous b-cells (+/R200Q) initially functioned normally in transplanted mice, consistent with normal glucose tolerance of heterozygous carriers during early childhood, followed by symptomatic diabetes within the first three decades of life (table S6 for age of onset) ()
 Upon increasing the requirement for human insulin following ablation of the mouses intrinsic b-cells, iPSC-derived b-cells from MODY3 patient (+/R200Q) were unable to fully compensate for the increased insulin requirement, and gradually developed phenotypes resembling those of HNF1A knockout b-cells, including a failure to secrete insulin in response to glucose, and reduced insulin to C-peptide secretion ratios
 Correction of the R200Q mutation in MODY3 iPSC-derived b-cells protected cells from acquiring abnormal insulin secretion profiles
 This study provides direct evidence that the HNF1A R200Q mutation is functionally consequential and pathogenic, leading to insulin Our studies demonstrate the utility of stem cell-based models in defining the molecular physiology of b-cell failure in gene-specific diabetes in humans
 Specifically, we show pleiotropic effects of HNF1A deficiency at several levels of b-cell biology and function, consistent with the diversity of its transcriptional targets
 The clinical implications of these studies are several We now have the technical capacity to create viable, functional human islet cell clusters capable of supporting glucose homeostasis in mice
 -cells generated by in vitro stem cell differentiation are now being tested for their ability to support glucose homeostasis in patients with autoimmune diabetes
 In MODY patients, -cell autoimmunity is not mechanistically involved, so that islets created from somatic cells of such patients should be immunologically tolerated by the patient
 Using techniques described in this paper, the mutant alleles of MODY3 (or other) patients could be corrected in stem-cell derived islets
 These cells could be used to restore glucose homeostasis in such subjects
 Additionally, insights gained with regard to the molecular physiology of MODY3 may point to novel pharmacological interventions for those disorders, and possibly for more prevalent forms of Human subject and cell lines
 Nine MODY3 subjects (Pt1 to Pt9), three MODY2 subjects (1068, 1133 and 1144) and four control subjects (1023, 1098, 1136 and 1015) were recruited at the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center and monitored over 2-5 years

 MODY3 patient 2 (Pt2), mother of patient 3 (Pt3) and segregating for same HNF1A (+/R200Q) mutation had a history of gestational diabetes in 2 pregnancies and was diagnosed as having T2D in 2003 at age 
 She was managed with oral agents until 2015 for increasing hyperglycemia (292 mg/dl and HbA1c of 
3%) when insulin was initiated and sulfonylurea discontinued
 Since her last visit in 2016, fasting glucose levels remained elevated (216 mg/dl and HbA1c of 
 %)
 MODY3 patient 3 (Pt3) was misdiagnosed as having T1D at age 13 and was found to have a mutation in HNF1A (+/R200Q) at age 
 Insulin was discontinued and sulfonylurea treatment prescribed
 Fasting glucose levels at age 19 were 177 mg/dl with an HbA1C of 
8%, for which the sulfonylurea dosage was increased
 Since then, Pt3s fasting glucose and HbA1C levels have risen progressively, reaching 338 mg/dl and 
9% by 2017 at age 
 During the patients last visit in 2017, non-fasting C-peptide levels were within the normal range (724 pM) but insulin was undetectable (0 pM)

3% and 
4% for sgRNA#12 and sgRNA#14, respectively, with indicated amplicon sizes (Table)
 The surveyor assay cleaves DNA at the site of heterozygosity
 Bands with amplicon size of ~500bp are due to the linked heterozygous SNPs rs1169301, creating cleavage
 (D) Table showing the percentage of mutant lines generated after CRISPR/Cas9 in hESCs leading to 
3% heterozygous clones (17 clones out of 98 total) and 
8% compound heterozygous clones (41 clones out of 98 total), indicating a 
2% of mutation efficiency (58 clones out of 98 total)
 4 clones of the 98 (4%) appeared homozygous by Sanger sequencing, but also lacked two linked SNPs, rs1169301 (102 bp from PAM sequence of sgRNAs#14 to SNP) and rs2071190 (130 bp from PAM sequence of sgRNAs#14 to SNP), which are both located in the second intron
 These homozygous lines (4/98, 4%) could be caused by a large deletion, and were not used for further studies
 In MODY3 iPSC,
