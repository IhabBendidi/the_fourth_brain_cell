 and a median survival of 14-18 months despite aggressive therapies-
 Currently, standard of care includes maximal safe surgical resection followed by concomitant radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide
 In nearly 100% of cases, this approach fails, resulting in a recurrent tumor with limited therapeutic options
 Few therapies are FDA-approved for patients with recurrent GBM, including lomustine, bevacizumab, carmustine wafers, and tumor-treating fields, none of which have demonstrated a marked improvement in overall survival-
 Multiple other cancers have faced similar obstacles to effective treatment, but this has been recently overcome with the use of immune-modulating therapies, and as a consequence, there is interest in trying to modify the immune system in GBM
 Several immunomodulatory approaches are currently under clinical evaluation, including the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, oncolytic viruses, dendritic cell vaccines, and CAR-T cell approaches10, but the well-A hallmark of GBM immunosuppression is the appearance of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) at higher levels than in many other cancers11, 13, -
 This heterogeneous cell population is activated upon injury and in many cancers, where MDSCs inhibit cytotoxic immune cell populations and contribute to overall immune suppression-
 In multiple solid tumor models and clinical trials, elevated peripheral MDSC levels have been correlated with a more immunosuppressive phenotype, as well as with tumors that were refractory to immune-activating therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors26, 
 We previously observed that GBM patients with a better prognosis had reduced MDSCs in their tumors as well as in their peripheral circulation13, 
 Previous studies have demonstrated that MDSCs in multiple tumor types can be reduced via low-dose chemotherapies-
 We recently found that this could be achieved in pre-clinical GBM mouse models via 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), an antimetabolite drug that certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Utilizing a metronomic low-dose 5-FU strategy, we were able to reduce circulating MDSCs, increase intratumoral activated T cell populations, and prolong survival
 Based on these pre-clinical observations, we sought to test this approach in recurrent GBM patients using an orally angiogenic agent
 The addition of bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) antibody, was used to ensure that patients received standard therapy for recurrent GBM
 In this phase 0/1 dose-escalation trial, our objective was to assess the ability of capecitabine to reduce circulating and tumoral MDSCs and to determine the safety/toxicity profile of capecitabine alone and in combination with bevacizumab in this patient population

 To target MDSCs, we assessed the efficacy of escalating low doses of metronomic capecitabine with a fixed, standard dose of bevacizumab in a clinical trial approved by the Cleveland Clinic IRB (NCT)
 Once GBM recurrence was identified on MRI, study-specific informed consent was obtained
 Capecitabine was given 5-7 days prior to operation and then continued in 28-day cycles with periodic blood draws to assess peripheral blood immune cell populations over the course of the trial (Figure )
 A total of 12 patients were enrolled initially, with one patient removed from all aspects of the study after their resection specimen identified pseudoprogression
 The demographics of the 11 evaluable patients are summarized in Table 
 The median age at diagnosis was 58 years; 7 patients were enrolled at the time of their first progression, and the remaining 4 patients were enrolled at their second progression
 Surgical therapy at diagnosis included biopsy only (2 patients), biopsy with laser ablation (1 patient), and surgical resection (8 patients)
 All patients then received standard-of-care radiation with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide
  Additional therapies prior to trial enrollment included other chemotherapies (4 patients (2 had received lomustine and 2 received tesevatinib a, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor)), tumor-treating fields (1 patient), and immunotherapies (3 patients)
 The 3 patients who previously received immunotherapy included 2 patients who failed anti-LAG3 treatment and 1 patient who received the SurVaxM vaccine
 Five patients had MGMT-methylated GBMs and 1 of these had an IDH mutation
 These 3 patients demonstrated no remarkable differences in immune populations compared to the others on the paradigms, are provided in Supplemental Table

  Patients in the 300 mg bid and 450 mg bid capecitabine treatment arms had a reduction in MDSCs post-surgery, which was not observed in the 150 mg bid arm (Figure A)
 As a comparison, a longitudinal analysis of newly diagnosed GBM patients conducted in a separate, contemporaneous study showed a continued increase in MDSCs over time after surgical resection (Figure A)
  This increase in peripheral blood MDSCs post-surgery has been attributed to surgical intervention in multiple cancer types16, 23, 31, 32 and occurs in untreated patients prior to surgical resection (Figure A)
 These analyses allowed us to identify a relative reduction in peripheral MDSCs post-surgical resection in the 300 and 450 mg bid capecitabine cohorts in 6 out of 7 patients (Figure A)
 Of note, patient 3 in the 450 mg bid capecitabine treatment cohort (the only patient who did not have a reduction in peripheral MDSCs post-surgery) was noted to have multifocal GBM at the time of recurrence and enrollment in the trial  The distal site of recurrence was not resected, and the patient progressed 1 month later at that lesion site
  Therefore, this patient was excluded from additional post-surgical analysis of peripheral blood immune populations
  A comparison of the average fold change in MDSCs post-surgical resection demonstrated an increase of MDSCs in untreated patients, a return to pre-operative baseline in patients treated with 150 mg bid capecitabine, and a reduction in patients treated with both 300 mg bid and 450 mg bid capecitabine
 The 300 mg bid capecitabine treatment reduced MDSCs to a level that was not further reduced when the capecitabine treatment was increased to 450 mg bid (Figure B)

 ;    To further determine the changes in tumor immune profiles associated with systemic capecitabine treatment, we analyzed GBM tissue from patients treated with capecitabine 5-7 days before surgery via CyTOF, which we previously used to identify immune shifts associated with GBM patient prognosis
 This immune panel consisted of 28 key cell surface immune system markers (Supplemental Figure A)
 In the CD45+ cell fraction from cryopreserved single-cell tumor suspensions of newly diagnosed GBM patients, recurrent GBM patients, and GBM patients treated with capecitabine in our trial (300 mg and 450 mg bid, Figure 4A), we identified 29 unique immune populations in an unbiased manner by using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analyses (Figure 4B, Supplemental Figure 2B, 2C) with no major change in overall CD45+ cell numbers (Supplemental Figure B)
 When comparing patients with newly diagnosed GBM, recurrent GBM, and recurrent GBM from the capecitabine-dose cohorts, we observed shifts in the tumor-infiltrating immune cell population (Figure 4C, Supplemental Figure )
 Overall, the newly diagnosed and recurrent patients appeared to have similar populations of immune cell clusters, while the groups treated with 300 mg bid and 450 mg capecitabine demonstrated a distinct immune phenotype resembling a more immune activated status (Figure 4C, Supplemental Figure )
 We did not observe a substantial change in overall intratumoral these patients to untreated patients with GBM (including newly diagnosed and recurrent), we observed significant increases in CD4+ central memory T cells (subset 1), CD8+ effector memory cells, classical monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, microglia (subset 1), NK cells (CD56 high), and NK cells (CD56 mid) (Figure 5, Supplemental Figure 4A, B)
 In addition, the application of a recently published machine-learning algorithm using the R package CytoDx33 to the intratumoral CyTOF data revealed that cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) levels were the most predictive marker to distinguish untreated versus capecitabine-treated patients, and this is represented as a decision tree of predictions showing the predicted cell population changes that occur upon treatment (Figure A)

 Taken together, these data demonstrate that low-dose systemic capecitabine treatment reduces circulating MDSCs when compared to a GBM resected under standard conditions, with the latter group experiencing a surgery-induced spike

 ;    Findings from this study indicate that low-dose capecitabine pre-operatively and post-operatively in combination with bevacizumab is well tolerated at all doses, with an acceptable side-effect profile
  While there is no control arm in this phase 0/1 trial, preliminary findings indicate that PFS and OS were comparable to historical controls1, 
  Comparisons of the immune populations between the capecitabine-treated groups revealed that 300 mg bid was the optimal capecitabine dose that led to maximal decreases in circulating MDSCs in a subset of patients without impacting lymphoid populations needed for an anti-tumor immune response
  Finally, CyTOF analyses revealed that 5-7 days of priming the immune system with low-dose capecitabine treatment at 300 mg bid and 450 mg bid enhanced the anti-tumor immune cell populations within the tumor, including CD8+ effector memory cells and NK cells
  However, these results are underpowered to resolve the complete effects of capecitabine on the tumor immune responses of the patients and support the expansion of this strategy to a larger, controlled clinical trial utilizing 300 mg bid While patients on this trial received both capecitabine and bevacizumab, the tumor immune profile was analyzed on surgical samples obtained before bevacizumab treatment
  Therefore, the observed intratumoral effects of capecitabine could not have been a result of bevacizumab treatment
  Furthermore, although circulating MDSC levels were analyzed while patients were on bevacizumab and capecitabine, the noted MDSC changes began to occur before the initiation of bevacizumab
  The decreasing MDSC levels also occurred in a capecitabine dose-dependent manner, making it unlikely that bevacizumab played a significant role

 ;    In this trial, we employed an emerging single-cell phenotyping approach, CyTOF, to gain insight into comprehensive immune signatures within GBM
 By integrating these data with a machine-learning approach33, we identified a potential increase in immune activation after capecitabine treatment
  Recently, utilization of next-generation technology to enhance clinical trials identified key changes between responders and non-responders-
  For example, in three recent GBM repertoire/clonality analyses demonstrated changes in the immune microenvironment as a result of therapy, immune alterations as a result of the dynamics of clonal tumor cell evolution, and specific immune signatures associated with response-
  Taken together, these approaches The dosing of chemotherapy agents has historically focused on the maximal tolerated dose to increase anti-tumor effects
  In many cases, these high doses are associated with profound bone marrow toxicity, eliminating both pro- and anti-tumor immune cells28, -
  However, chemotherapies such as 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine differentially impact the immune system at low doses, and this has recently been observed with temozolomide12, 16, 29, 
  By reducing the dose of these standard chemotherapies, it may be possible to reduce a subset of immune cells that drive immune suppression with little negative impact on anti-tumor immune cell concentration or function
  While the mechanisms of action are not well elucidated, this effect may be due to differential sensitivity and/or different proliferation rates
  In this trial, the capecitabine dose (300 mg bid) that led to the maximal decrease in peripheral immunosuppressive MDSCs was four- to five-fold lower than that used in colorectal cancer (1250 mg bid)42 and pancreatic cancer (2000 mg bid) 43, and increasing the dose of drug (to 450 mg bid) did not offer further reductions in intratumoral immune-activating cell subsets, suggesting that these doses were more specific for certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 Combined, these data suggest an optimally administered dosage of 300 mg bid capecitabine, with higher doses yielding no significant gains in MDSC reduction while increasing the propensity for side effects and potential global immune suppression
  Future studies should now investigate this approach in newly diagnosed GBM patients at the 300 mg bid dose, based on our observation that newly diagnosed patients have an overall increase in MDSC levels over time (which low-dose capecitabine was demonstrated to This study assessed the paradigm of an immunomodulatory approach based not on activating T cells but rather relieving immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment by targeting MDSCs
  However, targeting MDSCs as a monotherapeutic strategy may not be sufficient to obtain a durable clinical response
  Ongoing approaches are exploring immune-activating strategies in GBM, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, oncolytic viruses, CAR-T cells, and vaccine approaches
 Unfortunately, none of these approaches have yet to demonstrate durable immune responses and convincing evidence of patient benefit10, 
 One possible explanation for this lack of clinical benefit is that the treatments tested have yet to overcome the inherent immune-suppressive nature of GBM
 Therefore, future studies should be designed to utilize capecitabine in combination with other immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD1 therapy
  This design is based on the observation that while CTLA-4 was reduced upon treatment, we also observed that PD-1 increased, possibly due to immune activation, in capecitabine-treated patients, making it a practical combinatorial treatment strategy to further enhance the anti-tumor immune response (Supplemental Figure -)

 Capecitabine increases the immune activation in tumors after 7 days of treatment prior to surgery
 CyTOF analysis using an immune panel of 28 immune markers analyzed capecitabine-treated tumor samples from patients 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 along with newly diagnosed tumor samples (ND) (patients 1, 2, and 3), and one recurrent (Rec) GBM tumor (sample 1) (A) is represented as a tSNE multi-dimensional plot and colored by CD45 expression, highlighting the immune populations
 After selecting immune populations based on CD45 expression, all tumor sample immune cells were combined and used to cluster immune populations in an unbiased manner from Live/CD45+ cells only (B)
 Separate newly diagnosed GBM patients (n=3), recurrent GBM patients (n=1), 300 mg bid capecitabine-treated patient (n=2), and 450 mg bid capecitabine-treated patients (n=3) tSNE plots represent the immune landscape of each tumor cohort (C)

 Utilizing patient tumor CyTOF data, a machine-learning approach identified a reduction in a signature for immune cell exhaustion in the tumors of capecitabine-treated patients
 From the CyTOF data, a decision tree was generated using the CytoDx R package (A)
 The first node of the decision tree is highlighted, identifying the initial finding of 76% of patients with a lower level of CTLA-4+ cells
  Multidimensional tSNE modeling of the total CD45+ cells from the tumors of untreated and treated patients colored by CTLA-4 expression levels identifies the clusters with a reduction in CTLA-4 upon treatment (B)
 Manual gating of the CyTOF data highlighted the quantitative differences in CTLA-4+ lymphocytes in the tumors of patients treated with capecitabine (C)
 Further manual gating for the final subset of CTLA-4- cells identified by the decision tree revealed a unique population of CTLA-4+, PD-1+ macrophages that were certified by peer review) is the author/funder
