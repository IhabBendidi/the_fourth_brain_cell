 ;    OBJECTIVE: Studies on long-term sustainability of low-carbohydrate approaches to treat diabetes are limited
 We aim to assess the effects of a continuous care intervention (CCI) on retention, glycemic control, weight, body composition, cardiovascular, liver, kidney, thyroid, inflammatory markers, diabetes medication usage and disease outcomes at 2 years in adults with type 2 diabetes (TD)
 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An open label, non-randomized, controlled study with 262 and 87 participants with T2D were enrolled in the CCI and usual care (UC) groups, respectively
  RESULTS: Significant changes from baseline to 2 years in the CCI group included: HbA1c (-12% from 
 
1%); fasting glucose (-18% from 
 
90 mg/dL); fasting insulin (-42% from 
 
26 pmol L-1); weight (-10% from 
 
60 kg); systolic blood pressure (-4% from 
 
9 mmHg); diastolic blood pressure (-4% from 
 
5 mmHg); triglycerides (-22% from 
 
1 mg/dL); HDL-C (+19% from 
 
9 mg/dL), and liver alanine transaminase (-21% from 
 
97 U/L)
 Spine bone mineral density in the CCI group was unchanged
 Glycemic control medication use (excluding metformin) among CCI participants declined (from 
9% to 
8%, P=
3x10-11) including prescribed insulin (-62%) and sulfonylureas (-%)
 The UC group had no significant changes in these parameters (except uric acid and anion gap) or diabetes medication use
 There was also significant resolution of diabetes (reversal, 
5%; remission, 
6%) in the CCI group but not in UC
 All the reported CONCLUSIONS: The CCI sustained long-term beneficial effects on multiple clinical markers of diabetes and cardiometabolic health at 2 years while utilizing less medication
 The intervention was also effective in the resolution of diabetes and visceral obesity, with no adverse effect on bone health

 ;    Type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, and metabolic disease impact over one billion people and present a challenge to public health and economic growth(,S)
 In the United States, over 30 million people have diabetes and it is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially through increased cardiovascular disease (CVD)()
 The remission rate under usual care is 
5 - 2%(3) while intensive lifestyle intervention resulted in remission rates (both partial and complete) of 
5% and 
2% at 1 and 2 years()
 When lifestyle intervention is insufficient, medications are indicated to manage the disease When T2D care directed at disease reversal is successful, this includes achievement of restored metabolic health, glycemic control with reduced dependence on medication, and in some cases disease remission
 Three non-pharmaceutical approaches have demonstrated high rates of at least temporary T2D diabetes reversal or remission: bariatric surgery, very low calorie diets (VLCD), and nutritional ketosis achieved through carbohydrate restriction(,,)
 In controlled clinical trials, each approach has demonstrated improved glycemic control and CVD risk factors, reduced pharmaceutical dependence, and weight loss
 The three approaches show a similar time-course with glycemic control preceding weight With bariatric surgery, up to 60% of patients demonstrate T2D remission at 1 year()
 Outcomes at two years and beyond indicate ~50% of patients can achieve ongoing diabetes remission(,S)
 The second Diabetes Surgery Summit recommended using bariatric surgery to treat T2D with support from worldwide medical and scientific societies(10), but both complications and cost limit its widespread use(,S)
 VLCDs providing <900 kcal/day allow rapid discontinuation of most medications, improved glycemic control, and weight loss
 This approach is necessarily temporary, however, with weight regain and impaired glucose control typically occurring within 3-6 months of reintroduction of substantial A third approach to diabetes reversal is sustained dietary carbohydrate restriction

  A low carbohydrate Mediterranean diet caused remission in 
7% of newly diagnosed diabetes patients at 1 year versus 
1% with a low-fat diet (14), and a small randomized trial utilizing a ketogenic diet demonstrated improved weight and diabetes control at one year ()
 Systematic reviews also corroborate the effectiveness of a low-carbohydrate diet for T2D(16,S42) and it has recently become a restriction
 Given that total LDL-P, small LDL-P, and ApoB tend to improve or remain unchanged, the impact of an isolated increase in LDL-C on CVD risk in the context of this dietary pattern is unknown
   We have previously reported 1 year outcomes of an open-label, non-randomized, controlled, longitudinal study with 262 continuous care intervention (CCI) and 87 usual care (UC) participants with TD()
 The CCI included telemedicine, health coaching, and guidance in nutritional ketosis using an individualized whole foods diet
 Eighty-three percent of CCI participants remained enrolled 1 year and 60% of completers achieved an HbA1c <
5% while prescribed metformin or no diabetes medication
 Weight was reduced and most CVD risk factors improved()
 Here we report the results of this study at 2 years
 The primary aims were to investigate the effect of the CCI on retention, glycemic control, and weight
 Secondary aims included: (1) investigating the effect of the CCI on bone mineral density, visceral fat composition, cardiovascular risk factors, liver, kidney, thyroid and inflammatory markers; diabetes medication use, and disease outcomes (e
 g
 diabetes remission, metabolic syndrome); and (2) The comprehensive study design has been published previously (7,25), and the results presented here are the follow-up 2-year results (Clinical trials

 Long-term body composition changes assessed in CCI participants included bone mineral density (BMD), abdominal fat content (CAF and A/G ratio), and lower extremities lean mss (LELM)
 Body composition was not assessed in UC participants
 Cardiovascular-, liver-, kidney-, thyroid-related and inflammatory markers were analyzed (Table 1 and Supplementary Table )
 Changes in overall diabetes medication use, use by class, and insulin dose were tracked over the two years of the trial The prevalence of T2D (diabetes reversal, partial and complete remission), metabolic syndrome, suspected steatosis and absence of fibrosis were evaluated at 2 years in the CCI and UC groups using the criteria provided in Supplementary Table 2 (assignment references listed in the supplementary)

 All blood analytes were measured at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory
 The CCI participants were also assessed for total body composition changes at baseline, 1 and 2 years using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Lunar GE Prodigy, Madison, WI) and analyzed using GE Encore software(v

 A detailed description of the statistical method is included in the supplementary data (Methods section)
 Briefly, we conducted intent-to-treat analyses to assess study outcomes
 For continuous study outcomes, linear mixed-effects (LMM) models were used to assess within-group changes from baseline to 2 years and between-group differences at 2 years
 For dichotomous disease outcomes, generalized estimating equation models were used
 Changes in diabetes medication use and insulin dosage from baseline to 2 years were assessed using McNemars tests with continuity correction when appropriate and paired t-tests
 Available data only was used to assess changes in medication use, which was routinely adjusted as part of the intervention protocol
  Data from the two CCI educational groups were combined because no group differences were found, as in our prior time points(,S)

  Pharmaceutical interventions of 
5 to 3 years duration report HbA1c reductions of 
2 to 
0% with DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists(,,S-S)
 The HbA1c reduction of 
9% with this CCI is comparable to that observed in pharmaceutical trials, but is achieved while discontinuing 
0% of diabetes-specific prescriptions including most insulin and all sulfonylureas that engender risks for weight gain and hypoglycemia(,)
 Comparable improvements in glycemic control and reduced medication were not observed in UC participants recruited from the same healthcare system, suggesting that the CCI improves diabetes management relative to usual care
 Other interventions using The 
9% absolute (12% relative) HbA1c reduction observed at 2 years is consistent with low carbohydrate studies reporting HbA1c reductions of 8-15% at 2 to 
5 years (25,26,S49,S51) with medication reduction
 Two others studies reported no changes in HbA1c from baseline to 2 years, even though the low carbohydrate arm reduced HbA1c in the first 6 months(,S)
 This study observed a modest increase in HbA1c and weight between 1 and 2 years in CCI participants suggesting some reduction in long-term effectiveness
 Interestingly, insulin-levels show no regression toward baseline from 1 to 2 years indicating long-term improvement in hyperinsulinemia, an important component of diabetes Criticisms of low-carbohydrate diets relate to poor adherence and long-term sustainability(,)
 In this CCI, self-monitoring combined with continuous remote-monitoring and feedback from the care team, including behavioral support and nutrition advice via the app, may have improved accountability and engagement(S)
 In addition to glucose and weight tracking, dietary adherence was monitored by blood ketones

 This reveals an opportunity to increase adherence to nutritional ketosis for patients not achieving their desired health outcomes while prompting future research investigating the association between dietary adherence and health improvements
   A majority of the CCI participants (
5%) met criteria for diabetes reversal at 2 years while 
6% achieved diabetes remission (i
 e
 glycemic control without medication use) based on intent-to-treat with multiple imputation
 The percentage of all CCI enrollees (N=262) with verified reversal and remission requiring both completion of two years of the trial and an obtained laboratory value for HbA1c were 
8% and 
9%, respectively
 CCI diabetes reversal exceeds remission as metformin prescriptions were usually continued given its role in preventing disease progression(7,29), preserving -cell function(29) and in treatment of pre-diabetes per guidelines ()
 Partial and complete remission rates of 
4% and 
2% per year, respectively, have been reported in 122,781 T2D patients receiving standard diabetes care()
The two-year remission rate (both partial and complete) in the CCI (
6%) is higher than that achieved through intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) in the Look AHEAD trial (
 %)()
 Greater diabetes remission in the CCI versus Look AHEAD ILI could result from differences in the dietary intervention(14), patients ability to self-select their lifestyle or effectiveness of continuous remote care
 Length of time with a T2D diagnosis is a factor in remission, with longer time since diagnosis resulting in lower remission(,,,S)
 Despite a mean of 
4 years since diagnosis among CCI participants, the remission rate was higher than the Look AHEAD trial where its participants had a median of 5 years(4) since Participants in the CCI achieved 10% mean weight loss (-
9kg) at 2 years
 CCI weight loss was comparable to observed weight loss following surgical gastric banding (-
7kg) at 2 years()
 Previous studies consistently report that weight loss increases the likelihood of T2D remission(,,)
 CCI participants also improved blood pressure, triglycerides, and HDL-cholesterol
 Total cholesterol was unchanged and calculated LDL-cholesterol was increased at 2 years, but was not different from the LDL-cholesterol level observed at one year (+

 Non-elevated LDL cholesterol values together with higher triglycerides and lower HDL-cholesterol are common in patients with abdominal obesity, T2D, and metabolic syndrome(31,S55,S56); these individuals often still have elevated atherogenic lipoproteins such as non-HDL(32,S57), small LDL particles(31,S58), and VLDL(,S)
 In the CCI group, non-HDL cholesterol did not change significantly from baseline to 2 years and several cardiovascular risk factors across various physiological systems improved, suggesting that the rise in The CCI group had a reduction in visceral fat content, CAF and A/G ratio
 This is consistent with other low-carbohydrate interventions reporting visceral fat reduction as a component of weight loss(,,,,S)
 Anatomical distribution of fat around the abdominal area (android obesity) is associated with T2D(36,S60) and other comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome(37) and NAFLD(,S)
  The alleviation of visceral fat in the CCI group was concurrent with resolution of metabolic syndrome at 2 years, while sustaining one-year improvements of liver enzymes(7), steatosis and fibrosis (39 in press,S-S)
 While studies in animal models(40,S68,S69) and children treated with ketogenic diets(41,S70) have suggested retardation in skeletal development and reduction in BMD, in this study of T2D adults the CCI group had no change in total spine BMD over two years
 Our results are consistent with other adult ketogenic dietary studies that reported no bone mass loss in short-term(34,S71) or long-term follow-up of 2(35,S72) and 5(S73) years
 The differing findings of ketogenic diet on bone mass between adults and children could be due to differential effects on developed and This studys strengths include its size and prospective, longitudinal data collection from two participant groups (CCI and UC) which allowed statistical analysis by LMMs to investigate intervention time and treatment effects

 The study also included patients prescribed insulin and with long-standing disease, groups often excluded from prior studies
 The multi-component aspect of the intervention involving regular biomarker monitoring and access to a a remote care team may have improved the patients long-term dietary adherence and engagement
 The dietary advice including encouraging participants to restrict carbohydrates, moderate protein intake, and eat to satiety may also help in maintaining long-term effectiveness
 Weaknesses of this study include the lack of randomization and limited racial diversity
 Interpretation of DXA body composition was limited to subregion analyses due to to the scanner not At 2 years, the CCI, including remote medical management with instruction in nutritional ketosis, led to improvements in blood glucose, insulin, HbA1c, weight, blood pressure, triglycerides, liver function, and inflammation and reduced dependence upon medication
 These long-term benefits were achieved concurrent with reduced prevalence of metabolic syndrome and visceral adiposity
 The CCI had no adverse effect on bone mineral density
 The CCI group also had higher prevalence of diabetes reversal and remission compared to the UC group following a standard diabetes care program

 The participants used the app to upload and monitor their 99 reportable biomarkers including body weight and blood glucose and beta-hydroxybutryrate (BHB)
 Biomarkers allowed for daily 100 feedback to the care team and individualization of patient instruction
 Frequency of reporting was personalized over time based on 101 care needs
 Participants were advised to achieve nutritional ketosis (blood BHB level at 
5 to 
0 mmol L-1) through sufficient 102 carbohydrate restriction (initially <30g day-1 but gradually increased based on personal carbohydrate tolerance and health goals, 103 primarily control of glucose and weight)
 Participants daily protein intake was initially targeted at a level of 
5g kg-1 of a medium-frame 104 ideal weight body and further individualized based on biomarkers
 Participants were instructed to include sufficient dietary fat in meals 105 to achieve satiety without tracking energy intake
 Nutrition education directed consumption of monounsaturated and saturated fat with 106 sufficient intake of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fats
 The participants were also encouraged to consume sufficient fluid, 107 vitamins and minerals including sodium and magnesium, especially if signs of mineral deficiency were encountered (e

 Metformin prescriptions were continued except for contraindication, intolerance, or patient request given its efficacy 113 for T2D prevention []
 Education modules covered core concepts related to the dietary changes for achieving nutritional ketosis, and 114 adaptation to and maintenance of the diet(,)
 Participants selected their preferred education mode (CCI-virtual, n=126 or CCI-onsite, 115 n=136) during recruitment
 The CCI-virtual group received care and education primarily via app-based communication
 The CCI-onsite 116 group received care and education via clinic-based group meetings (weekly for 12 weeks, bi-weekly for 12 weeks, monthly for 6 months, 117 and then quarterly in the second year)
 All participants had access to the app for communication with their care team, online resources, 118 biomarker tracking and the opportunity to participate in an online peer community for social support
  119  The participants recruited for usual care (UC) received care from their primary care physician or endocrinologist and were 121 counseled by a registered dietician as part of a diabetes education program
 These participants received the American Diabetes 122 Association (ADA) recommendations on nutrition, lifestyle and diabetes management()
 No modification of their care was made for 123 the study
 This group was used as a reference control to study the effect of disease progression over 2 years in a cohort of participants 124 prospectively recruited from the same geography and healthcare system

 The scans obtained were analyzed using GE Encore software(v
10, Madison, WI)
 In many obese patients, full 131 body scans were not obtained due to the scanner not accomodating the patients complete body resulting in issues such as cropping 132 of the arms and/or overlapping of arms with the chest(,)
 To address these limitations, changes in bone density and fat and lean 133 mass were assessed using subregions rather than the full body scan
 We assessed changes in the bone mass by evaluating total 134 spine bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline to 2 years()
 For assessment of fat mass, we manually selected the central abdominal 135 fat (CAF) region using the software and evaluated the changes in CAF over time, as previously suggested for overweight 136 individuals(,)
 Furthermore, we assessed changes in the android:gynoid (A/G) ratio by time
 Due to lack of proper arm lean mass 137 measurement, we analyzed the lower extremities lean mass (LELM) to assess weight-related changes in lean mass over time(,)
  138 All analyses were conducted using SPSS statistical software (Version 
0, Armonk, NY)
 First, we examined the assumptions 140 of normality and linearity
 According to Klines (2011) (10) guidelines, 14 outcomes (i
 e
, fasting insulin, insulin and C-peptide-derived 141 HOMA-IR scores, triglycerides, ALT, AST, bilirubin, N-LFS, BUN, serum creatinine, TSH, Free T4, hsCRP, and BHB) were positively 142 skewed
 We explored two approaches to handling the skewed variables: natural log-transformations and removing the top 1% of values
 143 For N-LFS which includes both positive and negative values, a modulus log-transformation was performed instead of a natural log-144 transformation()
 For most variables, both approaches resulted in new skew and kurtosis values within the acceptable range
 One 145 variable (triglycerides) was only corrected via log-transformation, whereas two variables (C-peptide-derived HOMA-IR and TSH) were 146 only corrected by removing the top 1% of values
 For the other variables, we conducted sensitivity analyses to compare the two 147 approaches

 For 149 triglycerides, analyses were performed and p-values reported on the log-transformed variable but the means and standard errors 150 reported were computed from the untransformed variable
 Next, we ran independent sample t-tests to examine differences in baseline 151 characteristics between CCI and UC, and completers and dropouts
  152 We performed linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) to assess (1) within-group changes in the continuous study outcomes from 153 baseline to 2 years and (2) between-group differences (CCI vs
 UC) in the study outcomes at 2 years
 The LMMs included fixed effects 154 for time, group (CCI vs
 UC), and a time by group interaction
 Covariates included baseline age, sex, race (African American vs
 other), 155 BMI, and insulin use
 This maximum likelihood-based approach uses all available repeated data, resulting in an intent-to-treat analysis
 156 An unstructured covariance structure was specified for all models to account for correlations between repeated measures
  157 Within-group changes and between-group differences in dichotomous disease outcome variables; i
 e
, diabetes reversal, 158 diabetes remission (partial or complete) and complete remission(12), metabolic syndrome(13,14), steatosis(15), fibrosis(16) were 159 assessed, controlling for baseline age, sex, race, time since diagnosis, BMI, and insulin use
 For this set of analyses, multiple imputation 160 was used to replace missing values from baseline and 2 years with a set of plausible values, facilitating an intent-to-treat analysis (all 161 ns=)
 Missing values were estimated from 40 imputations (17) from logistic regression
 Within-group changes from baseline to 2 162 years and between-group differences at 2 years were assessed using generalized estimating equations with binary logistic models and 163 We also examined changes in participants diabetes medication use
 First, we compared rates of diabetes medication use within 165 groups from baseline to 2 years using McNemars test with continuity correction when appropriate

 Paired t-167 tests were used to assess within-group changes in insulin dosages from baseline to 2 years among participants taking insulin at 168 baseline and among participants taking insulin at both baseline and 2 years
  169 We conducted a second set of the analyses with 2-year completers only
 Results of the completers-only analyses appear in 170 eTable 3 and 
 Given that 2 different modes (virtual and onsite) were utilized for delivery of the CCI group educational content, we 171 also conducted another set of analyses to assess whether differences existed between the groups on all analyses of primary outcomes
 172 As in our prior time points (1,18), no group differences were found; thus, the data from the two CCI educational groups were combined 173 for this report
 For all study analyses, nominal significance levels (P) are presented in the tables
 A significance level of P<
0012 174 ensures overall simultaneous significance of P<

 175 During the second year of intervention, nine adverse events were reported including: one breast cancer diagnosis, one mycosis 179 fungoides, one onset of atrial fibrillation (Afib) with heart failure, one onset of migraine, two cases of chest pain (one resulting in stent 180 placement), one pulmonary effusion, and two pulmonary embolisms (one following orthopedic surgery and one with benign ovarian 181 mass/Afib)

0%, 
3kg) in the calculated LELM
 Most lean mass loss was encountered in the first 188 year without further reduction in year 
 Studies have reported that obese adults have about 20% higher thigh muscle mass than those 189 with normal weight(,)
 The reduced upper body load burden achieved through weight loss might explain the reduction of LELM
 190 This reflects an appropriate post-weight decrease in muscle mass rather than muscle deficiency(,)
  Weight loss (~10%) induced 191 by energy restriction resulted in slightly higher lean mass loss than the CCI (
4% appendicular lean mass and 
6% total lean mass 192 loss at 20 weeks)()
Total lean mass loss from 10% weight reduction by bariatric surgery is reported in the range of 
3 to 
9% from 193 baseline(,)
 Greater weight loss is usually associated with more lean mass loss(-)
 Approximately 25% of diet-induced weight 194 loss (without exercise) often arises from FFM()
 In the present intervention, FFM loss contributed an estimated 14% to the lower 195 extremity weight loss
 The lower proportion of  FFM loss in the CCI group, despite higher percentage of weight loss, may be due to the 196 adequate dietary protein recommendations (,)
 Since ~73% of FFM is water, the observed reduction of LELM in the first year of 197 intervention may have arisen from natriuresis and water loss during keto-adaptation(,)
