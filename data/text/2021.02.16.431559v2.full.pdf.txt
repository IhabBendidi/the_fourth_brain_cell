Subchronic data for repeated intravenous and intramuscular artesunate in animals are available in the literature for a maximum duration of -days
 Published results of genotoxicity studies in vitro in bacteria or cells of animal or human origin and in vivo in animals are equivocal, with a couple of negative results following oral administration and positive results in human cells
  With the studies performed in rats and dogs for a treatment period of 28-days including measures of safety pharmacology, toxicokinetic evaluation and in vivo genotoxicity data, a comparison of toxicity and exposure of intravenous versus intramuscular artesunate for a prolonged treatment period is possible, delivering important information, when a decision between both routes has to be made for use in patients
 Results of the peripheral blood micronucleus assay in rats were positive, suggesting genotoxic potential for the intravenous route of administration of artesunate, what is, beside patients, likewise relevant for production and health care personnel
  OBJECTIVES  The objectives of these studies were to investigate the toxicity, safety and toxicokinetics of single and multiple doses of artesunate for injection in rats and dogs
  METHODS  Sprague-Dawley rats and Beagle dogs were treated intravenously or intramuscularly for 28 consecutive days with doses of up to 30 mg/kg artesunate, evaluating toxicity, kinetics, genotoxicity, and cardiovascular and central nervous safety parameters after single and 4-week RESULTS  Artesunate was well tolerated with no mortality and only minor effects on clinical CONCLUSIONS  The results obtained in these studies support the safe use of artesunate in (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 No AUC was calculated for males and females on the first day of treatment (D1) for artesunate due to fast metabolism to DHA
 For the last sampling, additional early sampling time points were included, to enable calculating AUC values
