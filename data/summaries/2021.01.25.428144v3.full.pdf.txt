 day-exposure to  nylon microfibers resulted in significantly fewer human lung organoids (Figure B and C),  whereas the effects of polyester on organoid growth were less profound

  Having observed these effects after exposure to reference microfibers, we next performed  similar experiments using environmentally relevant polyester and nylon fibers on murine  lung organoids
 As observed with the reference fibers, exposure to environmental nylon microfibers  resulted in markedly fewer lung organoids (Figure A, B and C) as well as smaller organoids  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

We found significantly fewer airway  organoids in the presence of nylon microfibers on top of the gel or their leachate (Figure  A and B) compared to having the fibers inside the Matrigel

Effects of nylon reference fiber leachate on already-developed lung organoids
;    Manuscript van Dijk et al                    Page  of  Exposure to nylon inhibited epithelial development pathways and stimulated expression  To better understand the mechanisms behind the observed effects on the growth of  airway organoids, we performed bulk RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) analysis on epithelial cells  and fibroblasts resorted from organoid cultures exposed to two different concentrations of  nylon fibers ( or  fibers) or not
The downregulated transcripts were then sorted on the lowest q value for  exposure to  fibers and the upregulated transcripts were sorted on the lowest q value  for exposure to  fibers and the top  genes of each were used for pathway analysis  The top pathways identified for downregulated genes following nylon exposure were  highly enriched for epithelial development and function (figure E-F), while the top  pathways identified for upregulated genes were highly enriched for mRNA translation and  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

The expression of these genes correlated well with  our organoid findings that airway epithelial cell growth was most affected by exposure to  nylon fibers, while alveolar epithelial cell growth was less affected (Figure )
 To exclude the possibility that these effects on epithelial cells were the result of a  decreased support function from fibroblasts, for instance by nylon selectively killing  fibroblasts or inhibiting the expression of important growth factors, we separately  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
