Here we present first  results of our ongoing KETOCOMP study (NCT) study concerning body composition changes  among rectal, breast and head & neck cancer (HNC) patients who underwent concurrent KT during  Methods: Eligible patients were assigned to one of three groups: (i) a standard diet group; (ii) a  ketogenic breakfast group taking - ml of a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) drink plus  g  essential amino acids in the morning of RT days; (iii) a complete KD group supplemented with  g  essential amino acids on RT days
Compared to control subjects, the ketogenic  intervention in rectal and breast cancer patients was significantly associated with a decline in fat  mass over time (
In HNC patients, concurrent chemotherapy was the strongest predictor of body weight, fat free  and skeletal muscle mass decline during radiotherapy, while KT showed significant opposite  associations
Rectal cancer patients who underwent KT during neoadjuvant RT had significantly  better tumor response at the time of surgery as assessed by the Dworak regression grade (median   certified by peer review) is the author/funder

 As a proxy for measuring possible synergistic effects between ketogenic therapy and RT, we used the  Dworak regression grade [] at the time of surgery in rectal cancer patients treated with  neoadjuvant chemo-RT
In addition, the following covariates were  included based on their possible influence on body composition:  Age, gender, baseline BMI,  irradiated volume (planning target volume), and, for HNC patients, chemotherapy (=no/=yes) and  PEG use in the timeframe prior to a particular measurement
Patient # who was on a KD during RT refused surgery so that no Dworak grading  was performed; he continued with the KD after RT and was progression-free at the last follow-up at  In this interim analysis of the ongoing KETOCOMP study, we investigated the effect of a ketogenic  intervention  either a KD or a ketogenic breakfast containing highly bioavailable amino acids and  ketogenic MCT fat  on body composition changes during RT
Hence, it has been argued that high fat diets with an appropriate supply of amino acids provide  the best metabolic support for the cancer patient while minimizing tumor growth promoting stimuli  BIA is further useful to detect sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity which are not straightforward to  detect with standard anthropometric assessments, yet can have significant adverse consequences in  terms of treatment tolerability and overall survival []
Unfortunately, most  breast cancer patients experience weight gain during therapy [,], and low carbohydrate diets  have been proposed as an optimal countermeasure since they reduce insulin und blood glucose  spikes, decrease adipose tissue, increase HDL cholesterol and decrease triglycerides and  Further benefits of ketogenic diets have been found in preclinical studies in terms of direct anti- tumor effects that selectively sensitize tumor cells to radio- and chemotherapy [,]
 In this preliminary analysis we observed beneficial effects of a ketogenic intervention during RT on  body composition: Rectal and especially breast cancer patients lost adipose tissue while preserving  lean body mass and HNC patients lost significantly less BW, FFM and SMM compared to the control  group
