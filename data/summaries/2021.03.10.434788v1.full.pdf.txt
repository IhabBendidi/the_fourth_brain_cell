Intriguingly, disease-causing mutations identified in patients, together with  animal studies, have demonstrated that many orphan receptors play crucial physiological roles,  The majority of deorphanized GPCRs demonstrate coupling to Gi/o, however a limited number of  techniques allow the detection of intrinsically small constitutive activity associated with Gi/o protein  activation which represents a significant barrier in our ability to study orphan GPCR signaling
 Using luciferase reporter assays, we effectively detected constitutive Gs, Gq, and G/ protein  signaling by unliganded receptors, and introducing various G protein chimeras, we provide a  novel, highly-sensitive tool capable of identifying Gi/o coupling in unliganded orphan GPCRs
Excitingly, this approach illuminated the G protein coupling profile of  orphan GPCRs  (GPR, GPRb, GPR, GPR, GPR, GPR, GPRCD, and GPRCA) previously  We provide a new platform that could be utilized in ongoing studies in orphan receptor signaling  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
  Many orphan GPCRs are associated with pathological conditions and represent promising  The large family of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitutes the most exploited  drug target in the human genome (Hauser, Attwood, Rask-Andersen, Schioth, & Gloriam, ;  Sriram & Insel, )
;    particular in detecting those dominantly coupling to Gi/o proteins, we sought to develop a novel  We generated a library of GPCRs that comprises the entire class C GPCR family and a  subset of class A members including a total of  oGPCRs for testing with several luciferase  reporter systems activated in response to G proteins stimulation
Changes in cAMP levels can be readily detected after agonist-stimulation of Gi/o- coupled GPCRs, however, determining the constitutive activity of such receptors has proven  challenging
 To overcome this issue, we took advantage of previously developed G protein chimeras  (Ballister, Rodgers, Martial, & Lucas, ; Conklin, Farfel, Lustig, Julius, & Bourne, ; Inoue  et al, ), and generated novel G protein chimeras to expand the GPCR toolkit
;    GPCRs that preferentially couple to Gi/o to trigger alternative downstream signaling events  (Ahmad, Wojciech, & Jockers, ; Ballister et al, ; Conklin et al, ; Coward, Chan,  Wada, Humphries, & Conklin, ; Inoue et al, )
Herein, we tested  G protein chimeras  against a set of  well-characterized Gi/o-coupled receptors for a total of  combinations to  identify the most suitable ones for analysis of constitutive activity across our oGPCR library
 Taking advantage of a plasmid cDNA library encoding the entire  class C GPCRs, including   oGPCRs, and a subset of  class A GPCRs, including  oGPCRs, we systematically tested  their constitutive activity using several luciferase reporter assays and setting an arbitrary threshold  of  fold-increase for positive signals (Figure )
We first screened the library for Gq activation by  co-transfecting HEKT cells with each GPCR and a NFAT-RE luciferase reporter (Figure a)
Interestingly, some Gq-coupled receptors also triggered the expression of  luciferase activating the CRE reporter, while all the oGPCRs showed levels of activation  comparable to those of the control not expressing GPCRs (Figure b)
Overall, these  experiments revealed that luciferase reporters are sensitive enough to detect GPCR activity in  the absence of ligand application for some GPCRs; however, none of the  oGPCRs tested  showed any constitutive activation of Gq, Gs, or G/ signaling pathways
We reasoned that the  difference in luciferase expression obtained comparing cells expressing the reporter with or  without expression of the G protein chimeras could represent an index of reporter activation by  endogenously expressed Gi/o-coupled receptors
We thus screened our oGPCR library for  constitutive activation of GsGi and GsGo chimeras normalizing the luciferase signal to that  obtained in cells transfected only with the luciferase reporters but no G protein chimeras (Figure  a-b)
;    measuring Gi/o constitutive activation by oGPCRs shown in figure , we quantified the reduction  in cAMP levels induced by treatment with the adenylate cyclase stimulant forskolin in cells  overexpressing GPR, GRM or GPRCB
Many efforts have been made to create a universal platform for high- throughput screening of GPCR signaling that is independent of G protein coupling (Inoue et al,  ; Kroeze et al, )
However, despite the ability of class C GPCR members to recruit  -arrestins (Iacovelli, Felicioni, Nistico, Nicoletti, & De Blasi, ; Mos, Jacobsen, Foster, &  Brauner-Osborne, ; Mundell, Matharu, Pula, Roberts, & Kelly, ; Stoppel et al, ),  attempts to use this approach to deorphanize this subfamily of oGPCRs were unsuccessful  (Kroeze et al, )
Similarly, the use of cell-based assays expressing G protein chimeras in G  protein knock out cell lines to measure ligand-activated GPCR signaling has recently found a  number of applications (Inoue et al, ; Okashah et al, )
