As Narzarian et al and Harkey et al and others note this paucity of cost-effectiveness research has resulted in challenges to musculoskeletal imaging by third party payers and has provoked skepticism and resistance to needle guidance improved the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid injection Subjects: This project was in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration, was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) as ultrasound subset of a syringe safety trial (Human Research Review Committee approval -), and was registered at ClinicalTrials
Since the hypothesis was that ultrasound-guidance would be superior to anatomic landmark palpation-guided procedures and prolong therapeutic duration, the differences between parametric two group data were determined with the one tailed t-test with  The study groups were similar in age, gender, and baseline pain (Table )
However, despite these benefits, ultrasound-guidance was not statistically more effective at reducing pain at  weeks and  months, and in a patient with a painful osteoarthritic shoulder, modestly increased the A number of studies have supported the belief that sonographic guidance provides greater accuracy and improved outcomes for injection procedures (,,)
A recent review by Aly et al of published studies of over  shoulders confirmed improved accuracy with ultrasound in shoulder injections, including the glenohumeral joint with greater reduction in pain scores by VAS, a finding the   The present study demonstrated that in terms of pain scores at  weeks and  months, there was no difference between the anatomic landmark group and the ultrasound-guided injection group (Tables  and )
Sidon et al reported that anterior injections of the glenohumeral joint by anatomic landmark guidance has % accuracy which is comparable to ultrasound or fluoroscopy, thus, differences in injection outcome would not be expected ()
Further, Dogu et al found that ultrasound -guidance and anatomic landmark injections of the subacromial joint result in identical outcomes, similar to the present report in the glenohumeral joint ()
Also, the glenohumeral joint can be injected with an anterior, posterior, or superior approach with variable certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
