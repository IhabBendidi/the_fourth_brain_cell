In this study, we  investigated the hypothesis that genes in the lipid/lipoprotein pathway and those in the glucose  metabolic pathway are governed by different transcriptional logics that affect their response to  physiologic (fasting/refeeding) as well as pathophysiologic cues (insulin resistance and  hyperglycemia)
By leveraging a new mouse model developed for genome-wide interrogation of  FoxO function (), we discovered a FoxO transcriptional logic that provides insight into  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
To optimize conditions for genome-wide ChIP- seq, we performed immunohistochemistry in wild-type mice to determine the time- and dose- dependence of FoxO nucleocytoplasmic translocation in response to insulin
As the results were internally consistent, we performed further  Genome-wide FoxO ChIP peak calling detected ~, peaks; ~, unique peaks in  fasting, ~, in refeeding, and , in both conditions but to different extents (Fig
To  identify FoxO-regulated mRNAs, we induced somatic ablation of FoxO in liver by injecting  Foxolox/lox mice with AAV-Cre (A-FLKO) and documented its completeness and specificity by  mRNA measurements and western blotting of different tissues (Fig
FoxO sites in active enhancers were overwhelmingly  enriched in metabolic genes, with the top three fundamental ontologies being glucose  metabolism, lipid homeostasis, and insulin response (FDR - to -) (Fig
In contrast, enhancer-less FoxO sites  in promoter/TSS included gene ontologies related to intracellular transport, DNA repair, ncRNA  processing, and protein modification by small protein conjugation (Fig
;    These results indicate that the cell maintenance and metabolic functions of FoxO are  ruled by distinct transcriptional logics: the former are governed by core promoters in a  fasting/refeeding-independent manner, whereas the latter are governed by active enhancers and  Enrichment of FoxO sites in introns of triglyceride and cholesterol genes  The second most common genomic annotation of FoxO binding sites mapped to introns (Fig
Interestingly, triglyceride metabolism genes showed a skewed distribution,  with FoxO binding sites occurring at two- to three-fold the expected frequency at two locations:   to kb and  to kb from TSS (proximal introns and distal promoters), and  to % of  the expected frequency at  to kb and  to kb from TSS (Fig

In contrast, the ApoB, ApoA/C/A/A and  C/C/C/E clusters (the latter syntenic with the human APOCII enhancer) () showed fasting- independent FoxO binding to enhancer-less introns, and preserved mRNA expression following  The transcriptional logic of the FoxO regulome emerging from the preceding analyses  suggests that a majority of glucose metabolism genes are governed by an intergenic/proximal  promoter/TSS active enhancer-logic in a fasting-inducible manner, whereas a majority of  triglyceride, lipoprotein, and cholesterol genes are ruled by a bipartite intron-logic: fasting- We hypothesized that this differential logic underlies hepatic insulin resistance
We tested  the hypothesis using three different conditions: (i) resilience analysis to determine whether these  two regulatory modalities affect the ability of these genes to undergo compensatory changes in  response to variations in FoxO function, as a surrogate measure of insulin action (Fig
adult-onset somatic ablation of FoxO in liver (-) and  We generated Alb-Cre:FoxOfl/fl mice to induce constitutive hepatic FoxO ablation (C- FLKO) and compared gene expression differences between adult-onset (A-FLKO, described in  Fig
Thus, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia bring  about an ectopic, dysregulated binding of FoxO at enhancer sites, which we term enhancer  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

The extensive sharing of intergenic active enhancers of glucose genes by  FoxO and PPARa is a novel finding of this study that dovetails with the different physiologic  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
(c) Distribution of  FoxO binding sites associated with triglyceride homeostasis or glucose metabolic process genes  according to genomic annotation as in Fig
As insulin resistance  progresses, compensation by PPAR and spreading of FoxO binding to additional sites bolsters  expression of glucose metabolic genes, inducing fasting hyperglycemia with dyslipidemia
