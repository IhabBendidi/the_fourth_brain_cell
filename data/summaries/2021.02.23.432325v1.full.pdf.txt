These studies provide an easy and precise system to investigate the intercellular exchange stage of NP delivery, and shed the first light in the importance of EVs in NP transport (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Our results showed that a significant number of NPs are transferred from one cell (donor) to another (recipient) in membrane-enclosed structures, which we hypothesized to be either secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) or through direct cell-cell contact
In all our studies, donor cells were incubated with CPP-AgNPs and etched in bulk, and then evenly aliquoted into different experimental groups
Plus, this allows us to simplify the analysis, and directly define the intercellular exchange efficiency as the total AgNPs that can reach The first version of our assay simply cultured the donor/recipient cell mixture in ultra-low binding plates, which is vastly different from the physiological conditions of cell growth
Several parameters were further optimized to maximize the intercellular exchange, such as cell number, donor/recipient ratio, and incubation time (Fig
Interestingly, we observed little difference in the intercellular exchange efficiency when plating donor cells on top either as monolayer or when encapsulated in a separate collagen layer (Fig
We speculate three possible routes of intercellular exchange: CPP-NPs are exported as free agents (direct release), or are exocytosed into EVs, or are exchanged via direct contact between donor and recipient cells
The collagen gap between donor and recipient cells, however, exhibited little effect on the intercellular exchange of NPs, regardless of constant etching
Besides silver nanoparticles, we found that the intercellular exchange of TAT-conjugated gold nanoparticles (T-AuNPs), which is not etchable, could also be decreased by Second, we isolated EVs secreted by donor cells after CPP-NP internalization and etching
These results demonstrate that these inhibitors can effectively block the re-entry of freely released CPP-NPs into recipient cells, while NP-carrying EVs are resistant to them
These data support the notion that while freely released CPP-NPs still rely on the same ligand-receptor interaction for cell entry, NP-carrying EVs (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Overall, our results call for more careful design of ligand-functionalized NPs when aiming at solid organs/tissues like tumors, and highlights the importance of EV biology (surface proteomics, transport dynamics and cell uptake specificity) in improving the tissue penetration (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
