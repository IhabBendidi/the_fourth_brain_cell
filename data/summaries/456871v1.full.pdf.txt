Infants with post-menstrual age (PMA) of  weeks with positive blood  culture and one, or those with negative culture and at least with two predefined clinical and  laboratory signs suggestive of LOS, or those with PMA > weeks meeting the Goldstein  criteria of sepsis, were randomized in a : ratio to receive meropenem or SOC  (ampicillin+gentamicin or cefotaxime+gentamicin) for - days
The primary outcome was  treatment success (survival, no modification of allocated therapy, resolution/improvement of  clinical and laboratory markers, no need of additional antibiotics and presumed/confirmed  eradication of pathogens) at test-of-cure visit (TOC) in full analysis set
