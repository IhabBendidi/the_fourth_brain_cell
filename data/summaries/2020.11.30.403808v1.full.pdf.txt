We therefore develop a computational model here, based on  experimental thrombectomy data, to quantify the impact of micro-emboli on blood flow in the brain  after the removal of a clot

Recently, an in- silico study on a mouse cortex microvascular network found that the severity of micro-strokes in the  capillary bed were heavily influenced by the local network topology, with decreases in flow of up to  On the macro-scale, full organ models of blood flow in the brain have been developed [,]
 To the best of our knowledge no models of micro-emboli occlusions have been developed for post- This paper then seeks to answer, through modelling informed by in-vitro experiments, the following  questions: To what extent is clot fragmentation responsible for the post-thrombectomy no-reflow   (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November , 
 Prior work has shown how blood flow can be simulated in a coupled model of the penetrating vessels  and a porous representation of the capillary bed []
This model is adapted here such that it can be  used to determine the permeability of the penetrating arterioles in health and with micro-emboli  An example voxel, where the penetrating arterioles are coupled to the capillary bed, is shown in Fig b
Previous models have  approximated the Dirac delta singularity with a function that is spatially variant yet maintains mass  conservation []; have approximated the pressure drop in the vicinity of the coupling point to deal with  the strong pressure gradients that appear there []; or have simply taken the discretised element nearest   (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November , 
The large number of maximum clots is chosen  such that we can ensure that all the vessels are eventually occluded, allowing us to track the damage   (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted November ,

Using a combination of in-vitro experiments of clot fragmentation and in- silico blood flow modelling, we have developed simulations of micro-emboli occluding vessels in the  penetrating arterioles and capillary bed
Using these models we characterised averaged flow  parameters, such as permeability and coupling coefficients, in healthy conditions and under micro- emboli showers, for a range of thrombectomy techniques and clot consistencies
