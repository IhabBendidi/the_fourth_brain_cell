The results of these studies demonstrated that pelargonidin, a natural flavonoid bind and activates the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) in vitro and reverses intestinal inflammation caused by chronic exposure to high fat diet or to the intestinal braking-barrier agent DSS in a AhR-dependent manner
In summary, we have provided evidence that a natural flavonoid might hold potential in reducing intestinal inflammation and ACE induction in the  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February ,

In the present study we have investigated the potential of the natural pelargonidin in regulating ACE expression in colon in models of intestinal inflammation caused by exposure of wild type and AhR-/- mice to a high caloric intake and intestinal irritants
The results of these studies show that not only a dietary agent might regulate the expression of the ACE in the colon but also inhibit the interaction of SARS-CoVs spike protein with ACE, providing a potentially useful clues in the  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February ,
