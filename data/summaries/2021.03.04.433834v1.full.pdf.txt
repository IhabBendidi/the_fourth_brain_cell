hiPSC-CMs have been associated with a vast heterogeneity regarding single-cell morphology, beating behavior and Previously published hiPSC-CM studies revealed action potentials with nodal-, atrial- or ventricular-like morphology, although ion channel expression of singular hiPSC-CMs is not fully understood
Thus, the current study used a single-cell patch-clamp-RT-qPCR approach to get insights into single-cell electrophysiology (capacitance, action potential duration at % of repolarization, upstroke velocity, spontaneous beat rate, and sodium-driven fast inward SCNA, KCNJ, CACNAD, and KCNH), the combination of both within individual cells, and their correlations in single cardiomyocytes
Higher expression of atrial-associated ion channels in primary atrial cardiomyocytes and atrial Pluricytes compared to their ventricular counterpart between the single-cell parameters was challenging, as the total data set is complex, particularly for parameters depending on multiple processes, like the spontaneous beat rate
Investigating the single-cell phenotypes of hiPSC-CMs revealed a combination of attributes which may be interpreted as a mixture of traits of different adult cardiac cell types: (i) nodal-related pacemaking attributes are spontaneous generation of action potentials and high HCN expression; and (ii) non-nodal attributes: cells have a prominent INa-driven fast inward current, a fast upstroke velocity and a high expression of SCNA
;    Primary human cardiomyocytes as well as human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are used as model systems in pharmacological and toxicological drug testing (Magdy, Schuldt, Wu, Bernstein, & Burridge, ; Nguyen et al, ; Pang et al, ; Yoshida & Yamanaka, )
For hiPSC-CMs, expression of cardiac ion channels was reported on a population level and single-cells were shown to display ionic currents (Barbuti, Benzoni, Campostrini, & DellEra, ; Karakikes, Ameen, Termglinchan, & Wu, ; Ma et al, )
These first observations of obvious differences between individual cells prompted us to perform a systematic characterization of hiPSC-CMs on the single-cell level and to compare It is well established that cardiomyocytes from different regions of the heart (nodal, atrial and morphology (Kane & Terracciano, )

 channel subunit and conducting INa) is associated with the fast inward current and the upstroke of the action potential in primary atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, while it shows no/low expression in primary nodal cells (Kane & Terracciano, ; Priest & McDermott, )
Not surprisingly, for cells of different origins, we recognized that primary cardiomyocytes have overall lower CT values (higher expression levels) for every target gene investigated except HCN and CACNAG than the three hiPSC-CM groups (see Table )
For a high percentage of single hiPSC-CMs, spontaneous beating was observed (iCell cardiomyocytes:  %, ventricular Pluricytes:  %, atrial Pluricytes: %)
Therefore, we performed single-cell RT-qPCR of nine KCNJ, CACNAD and KCNH), the cardiac related gene TNNT and the potential and atrial Pluricytes) and primary human ventricular and atrial cells
;    significant differences between primary atrial or ventricular cardiomyocytes with each of the Table : Results of single-cell RT-qPCR
Primary ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes showed an overall higher expression level (lower CT values for every target gene investigated except HCN and CACNAG) than the three hiPSC-CM groups
For details of analysis of single-cell RT-qPCR data, see In addition, ventricular Pluricytes showed a significantly higher mean CT than iCell cardiomyocytes
The percentage of positive cells for KCNJ is higher in primary cardiomyocytes (ventricular: %, atrial: %) than in hiPSC-CMs (-%)
We hence asked whether beating and non-beating cells within one hiPSC-CM group (iCell cardiomyocytes, ventricular Pluricytes and atrial Pluricytes) differed with regard to ion channel expression (HCN, electrophysiology (capacitance, APD, fast inward current amplitude and fast inward current density)
In addition, ventricular Pluricytes show a higher fast inward current amplitude, density and upstroke velocity compared We constructed histograms to visualize the distribution of single-cell data (see Figure  and SuppFigure )
;    For the electrophysiological parameters, data are only available for primary ventricular cardiomyocytes and we can therefore not evaluate whether shapes of histograms of electrophysiological data from iCell cardiomyocytes do not indicate subpopulations, but show a bigger range of distribution (except for capacitance) compared to primary ventricular To investigate the relation between all parameters determined on single-cell level, we correlated each parameter with every other parameter (in total  parameters, see Table ) for each cell velocity [V/ms], APD [ms], CT of KCNJ, CT of HCN, CT The results are shown in Supp
primary ventricular cardiomyocytes): For all three hiPSC-CM groups, an inverse correlation for the fast inward current amplitude and density with the upstroke velocity of the action potential was found (see Figure )
Our findings with single cells are comparable to those previously reported for hiPSC-CM monolayers: In multi-electrode array (MEA) experiments, iCell cardiomyocyte monolayers showed a spontaneous beat rate of  bpm and ventricular Pluricytes of  bpm  (Rast et al, )
Taking this into consideration, ventricular Pluricytes still show the slowest beat rate/highest inter-beat interval One likely mechanism contributing to the automaticity of hiPSC-CMs and nodal cardiomyocytes is the substantial presence of the depolarizing funny pacemaker current (If) in combination with no/low levels of IK, an inwardly rectifier potassium current which stabilizes resting membrane potential of adult human primary atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes (Goversen et al, ; Verkerk et al, )
;    differences are found between the five cell groups assessed in the current investigation, with human primary ventricular cardiomyocytes showing the highest mean CT (lowest expression), atrial Pluricytes (lowest mean CT/highest expression)
In summary, CT values for primary human ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes were higher than for hiPSC-CMs, indicating a Besides HCN, we investigated the expression of KCNJ (Kir 
It is difficult to estimate the influence of the two parameters (percentage of positive cells and CT) on the total expression level, making it difficult to (regarding percentage of positive cells and CT) between ventricular Pluricytes and primary ventricular cardiomyocytes could lead, together with highest CT for HCN (when considering hiPSC-CMs) in ventricular Pluricytes, to a slower spontaneous beat rate compared to beat rates (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
In the heart, both channels show higher expression in nodal and atrial cells and have low/no expression in primary ventricular cardiomyocytes (Kane & Terracciano, )
Since duration of the action potential can be influenced with pharmacological modulation of L-type calcium (ICaL) and hERG (IKr) currents (Rast et al, ), we investigated whether APD differences between the cell types and the heterogeneity of single cells within one cell type (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
The CT values were comparable between the cell groups except for one pair: Ventricular Pluricytes showed a significantly lower mean CT (higher expression) than primary ventricular cardiomyocytes
In line with these findings, another study reported a TTX-dependent upstroke of the action potential in iCell The ion channel transcripts investigated using the single-cell RT-qPCR approach were chosen due to estimated functional relations to electrophysiological parameters and due to assumed differential expression in primary cardiac subtypes
In addition, we also expected a prototypical ventricular-like hiPSC-CM to be present in the iCell cardiomyocyte culture with the following characteristics: no spontaneous beating, long action potential, a steep upstroke, prominent fast inward current, no expression of HCN, CANCAG and CACNAD but positive for SCNA, KCNH and KCNJ
The majority of hiPSC-CMs of all three investigated groups (iCell cardiomyocytes, ventricular and atrial Pluricytes) was beating spontaneously (i
, differences in global gene expression has been reported between human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes/hiPSC-CMs and both, fetal and adult cardiomyocytes (Gupta et al, (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
