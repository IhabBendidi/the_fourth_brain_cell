The benefit of TAVR on -month KCCQ scores was greatest in the joint model fit to all survival data (mean difference = 
surgical risk, the estimated benefits of TAVR on survival and health status compared with standard care were greater in joint Bayesian models than other approaches
Given the correlation between health status and survival, modeling both outcomes simultaneously may improve the precision of both effect estimates and providing a more holistic summary of treatment benefits
To date, these approaches have mostly focused on improving the power of clinical trials by incorporating patients health status into the survival certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Specifically, we applied a Bayesian joint model of survival and health status to describe the outcomes of patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis and extreme surgical risk who were not candidates for surgery and were randomized to either transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or standard therapy (including a combination of medical management and balloon valvuloplasty) in the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves PARTNER B trial,  We compared these estimates with alternative modeling approaches including the original analysis and a more standard Bayesian model that didnt jointly model the outcomes
These plots show that both joint approaches estimated lower health status in the standard care group than either the longitudinal growth curves or the separate Bayesian model
These findings illustrate the potential value of joint modeling in providing a more accurate estimate of the impact of therapy in trials where there is a substantial mortality difference between treatment groups that contributes to certified by peer review) is the author/funder
While this approach may reflect a greater focus in those fields on analyzing treatments in terms of both survival and quality of life, joint modeling has also been used to improve the precision of survival hazard estimates using longitudinal biomarkers or patient-reported outcomes
