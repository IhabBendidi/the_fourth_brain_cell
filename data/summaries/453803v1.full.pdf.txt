Cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis may aid in malignancy assessment and early METHODS The multi-center clinical study enrolled  patients with operable occupying lung diseases

 out of the  genes harbored mutations in the lung cancer patients with the largest number found in TP (% plasma and % tumor tissue samples) and EGFR (% and %, respectively)
The studies examined DNA methylation regulation () or the hypermethylation of the promoter regions of genes () for the potential biomarkers of lung In this study, we report a multi-center clinical trial result on ultra-deep sequencing in patients that undergo surgical resection either benign nodules or with different stages of lung cancer
The most commonly mutated genes in the lung cancer patients are TP (%) and EGFR (%) certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
The sensitivity increases as the stage advances and ctDNA outperform the serum biomarkers in all The mutation profiling classifies the lung nodules from benign to malignant (Figure )
