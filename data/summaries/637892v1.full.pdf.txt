One Sentence Summary: A blood transcriptome signature predicts response to recombinant human growth Key words: Gene expression, growth hormone (GH) deficiency, Turner syndrome, GH treatment
Network  models identified an identical core set of genes in both GHD and TS at each year of therapy whose expression  can be used to classify therapeutic response to r-hGH
 The transcriptome represents a level of omic data that reflects genetic information, developmental stage in  relation to age () along with the impact of the local environment () and, therefore, has potential to classify  Response to r-hGH in the first year of therapy is considered to be a primary marker of growth response
In contrast in this study we have used peripheral blood gene expression  profiling as the source for gene expression profiles, and show that these patterns can be used to predict  response to r-hGH in each year of treatment up to five years in two different growth disorders that account  not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
 GHD and TS blood transcriptome at baseline can be used to classify response to r-hGH therapy year-on-year  not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
These data  show clear classification of good and poor responders: at each year of the study all PLS-DA area under the  curve of the receiver operating characteristics (AUCs) were between % and % and all RF AUCs were  There was limited overlap between GHD and TS whole blood transcriptomic markers related to growth  response at each year of the study (Supplemental Table S)
We therefore generated interactome network  models including inferred interactions to assess whether GHD and TS growth response-associated gene  expression was related by affecting the function of similar network modules, albeit in different ways
 The facts that i) genetic associations with growth response map to the network models derived from  transcriptomic data and that ii) the network connectivity of the central modules changes over the duration of  the study imply that the network models are robust and account for the effect of development on related  The Identification of core sets of genes that can classify response to r-hGH in both GHD and TS  The overlap between network models was used to select a common set of genes at each year of therapy  present in both GHD and TS
Genes within this common list were selected for growth response classification  if they had previously been identified as significantly associated with height velocity by rank regression in  either GHD or TS (p<
Using the data provided  by this previously published study we examined the epigenome at baseline (prior to r-hGH treatment) in  relation to growth response (measured by knemometry) in GHD patients (n=) and found that using a gene  level summary of DNA methylation ( genes)  had methylation associated with growth response to r- hGH (rank regression, p<
 Our previous analysis has shown limited utility of genetic associations derived from a candidate set of growth  related genes in the prediction of response to r-hGh in GHD and TS after one year of therapy (, , )
Hence  genetic data do not appear to be powerful enough on their own to be used in prediction and clinical  The whole blood transcriptomic profile of GHD and TS patients has been shown to be associated with first year  growth response to r-hGH () and to correlate with the interaction between GHRd and GHD severity ()
We generated network models of growth response (as  determined by height velocity) at each of the five years of treatment using baseline gene expression
The data set generated was subject to quality control to investigate the  Baseline gene expression associations with height velocity in each year of growth response were determined  using rank regression with microarray batch, age, body mass index (BMI) at baseline as covariates for both  GHD and TS patients along with gender and peak GH test response (average of two provocative tests) for the  GHD patients
