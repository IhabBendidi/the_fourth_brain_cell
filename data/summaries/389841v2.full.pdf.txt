We recently reported the effectiveness of a continuous care intervention (CCI)  emphasizing nutritional ketosis for improving HbAc, body weight and cardiovascular risk  factors in TD patients
 Conclusion: This study demonstrates improved sleep quality as assessed by PSQI in patients  with TD and prediabetes undergoing CCI including nutritional ketosis but not in TD patients  receiving UC

Lifestyle  intervention induced weight loss showed significant reduction in the apnea and hypopnea  indices (AHI) in conjunction with a decrease in hemoglobin Ac (HbAc) levels in a randomized  controlled trial of obese OSA patients with comorbid diabetes 
 Intervention studies specifically targeting sleep disruption in OSA patients without any effect on  weight, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, have shown  contradictory results for glycemic control
It is not clear from these studies whether  improvement of glycemic control in conjunction with weight loss improves sleep quality or vice- not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
We recently demonstrated a continuous remote care treatment for  TD including nutritional ketosis significantly improved glycemic control, weight, and  cardiovascular disease risk factors and reduced diabetes medication use at one year -
These data were initially analyzed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the  CCI in improving diabetes status (glycemic control and medication use), weight and other  metabolic factors in TD , and prediabetes patients (unpublished data, manuscript in  preparation)
All participants in the CCI  group were stratified by sleep improvement status based on their baseline and one year global  PSQI scores

Global PSQI scores among the CPAP users at baseline and one year did not show a  significantly different distribution pattern than what was observed in the full cohort of  This study is one of the first designed to assess the effect of carbohydrate restriction and  nutritional ketosis on sleep quality in individuals with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance
The sleep disturbance component of the global  PSQI score is associated with poor glycemic control among TD patients
