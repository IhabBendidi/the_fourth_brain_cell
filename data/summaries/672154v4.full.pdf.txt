We developed a form of repetitive               transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) that in an open-label study               was associated with remission from MDD in % of individuals in - days (Stanford Accelerated Intelligent                Neuromodulation Therapy, SAINT)
The multiple, significant reductions in           FC we observed following SAINT and remission from depression support the hypothesis that MDD is a state of                  hyper-connectivity within these networks, and rapid decoupling of network nodes may lead to rapid remission               certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has greater efficacy and more rapid onset of action                than antidepressant medications; however, mean onset is still > weeks (), open-label remission rates occur               in only -% of patients (), and there are numerous significant off-target effects, including cognitive               disturbances () and effects on the motor system (), making it difficult to determine which network changes                 are specific to remission from depression
We                 recently developed a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) that was associated with              remission in % of individuals (n=) with moderate-to-severe, treatment-resistant MDD in a mean of ~ days                without off-target effects in an open-label study (, )
The neural basis of emotion regulation includes emotional reactivity: amygdala               and striatum; explicit control of emotion  central executive network (CEN): dorsolateral prefrontal cortex              (dlPFC), ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC); and implicit emotion regulation  default mode network (DMN), salience              certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Numerous fMRI studies have                demonstrated that individuals with MDD have altered frontal connectivity with amygdala () and striatum              (, ); hyperconnectivity between DMN and amygdala (); and alterations in insular connectivity             Following the emotional dysregulation hypothesis of depression, stimulation of the CEN at the lDLPFC              node, via rTMS (, , ) and transcranial direct current stimulation (), has been hypothesized to produce                 antidepressant effects by enhanced regulation of emotion
This is in line with Chen et als seminal interleaved                 TMS/fMRI study demonstrating causal interactions between CEN and DMN, such that increased activity in              CEN results in suppression of DMN (), and this has led others to hypothesize that improved accuracy of                  targeting these networks might produce better treatment efficacy (, ), as only a third or less of                 participants remit from their depressive episode with rTMS stimulation of the lDLPFC, a CEN node ()
The analysis we undertook in             this initial report focused on brain regions associated with emotion regulation, and we found that FC                significantly decreases between several of these regions following remission from MDD, with the magnitude of               FC change often correlating with symptom improvement
Bearing in mind that open-label SAINT was associated with remission in % of participants in - days                  Moreover, this hypothesis builds on some of the earliest neuroimaging studies in the field of psychiatry,                which reported increased sgACC activity in patients during depressive episodes ()
Thus, we hypothesize that the significant reduction in FC in nearly all DMN                nodes that we observed in SAINT may reflect the normalization of DMN hyper-connectivity associated              Interestingly, at the group level, FC between sgACC and DMN significantly decreased following SAINT              in our cohort; however, individual changes in FC magnitude showed that participants with increased FC               between sgACC and DMN actually had the greatest clinical improvement
Others have reported the opposite direction of association with the                largest improvements in depression being associated with the largest reductions in FC between sgACC and               mDMN (); however, their patient cohort had comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder, which may respond              certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Considering that non-depressed individuals can better suppress amygdala activity (,             ), our results here could represent a partial normalization of connectivity related to improved emotion               certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
