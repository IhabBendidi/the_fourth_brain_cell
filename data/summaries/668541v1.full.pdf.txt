Objective: To evaluate if non-invasive brain stimulation modulates the ANS, we analyzed HRV metrics collected in a previously published study of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) for the modulation of CLBP through enhancing alpha oscillations

While opioid therapy has shown short-term efficacy in decreasing pain, few studies have investigated its long-term effectiveness () and systematic reviews identify multiple severe risks of long-term use, including: misuse, abuse/dependence, overdose, and death (,)
Regulatory ANS function can be quantitatively assessed by the analysis of the heart rate variability (HRV), which is the certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Previous studies have targeted the reduced RSA using biofeedback interventions, and HRV components have been used to measure the efficacy of chronic pain therapies ()

All analyses were run on the difference of data before and after stimulation (post - pre) after taking the natural logarithm (within Porges-Bohrer certified by peer review) is the author/funder
;    In this study, we investigated how non-invasive brain stimulation (Hz-tACS) alters ANS balance measured with RSA and how these metrics correlated with the level of pain and other self-report characteristics
Our findings thus suggest that SDNN may be a better target than Previous studies, which investigated non-invasive brain stimulation interventions in chronic pain, have shown promising, but varied results (,,)
Several studies have investigated non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in patients with chronic pain, but treatment effects vary across the studies, and typically only clinical outcomes are reported
Our results presented here along with those in our previous paper () show that brain network dynamics and self-reported pain seem to be more sensitive ways than HRV metrics to measure effects of brain stimulation for certified by peer review) is the author/funder
