These results reveal a significant contribution of blood cells to the clot fracture, as well as the dissipative length scale and nonlinear plug and seal the blood vessel defects, where they are exposed to shear stress, tension and blood pressure from the local tissue even fatal The fracture of the blood clots at wound sites results clot yields small pieces of thrombi that may disturb blood flow clots in human health, it is not well understood compared to the cracks
, fracture energy required to extend a unit area of crack) of blood clots are soft (shear modulus <  kPa) and deformable, this methods such as pure shear tests
, , , - This journal is   The Royal Society of Chemistry xx measure the fracture energy of human blood clots
 Fracture energy of blood clots measured by lap shear test were size independent
(B) Force-displacement curves of lap shear tests for whole blood (WB) clots and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) clots; the inset shows the fracture surface of the WB specimen
(D) Representative force-displacement curves of whole blood clot lap shear tests of different sample lengths
(E) Fracture energy of whole blood clots obtained from lap shear tests of different sample lengths
