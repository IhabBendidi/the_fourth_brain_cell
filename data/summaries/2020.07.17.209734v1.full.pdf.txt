addition to the evaluation of new and existing repurposed anti-TB drugs, there has  also been an increased interest in non-antimicrobial host-directed therapies (HDTs)  which often target host immune responses with the potential to shorten and improve  protein kinase (AMPK)-activating anti-diabetic drug found to be associated with  intracellular growth of Mtb and improve the efficacy of first-line anti-TB drug;  experiment, MET failed to enhance the potency of current anti-TB treatment regimen  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

 To investigate whether metformin could restrict the growth of Mtb and enhance the  efficacy of the first-line anti-TB drug INH, we infected non-diabetic control and TD  mice with a very-low aerosol dose of Mtb HRv which closely mimics the human  TB
