The data suggests that CD+ T cells carrying latent viruses circulate between blood and lymphoid tissues in individuals on ART and support the idea that recombination may play a role in the emergence of rebound viremia
Using these methods latent viruses have been recovered from lymph nodes, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), spleen, CNS, In  recent studies, comparison of circulating latent viruses and rebound viruses showed a very limited number of overlapping sequences (, )
To investigate the intact proviral reservoir, we obtained mononuclear cells from lymph nodes (LNMC) and peripheral blood (PBMC) from  ART treated HIV- infected individuals (extended not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
There were no statistical differences between the frequency of clonal sequences in blood compared to lymph node (two sided Fishers exact test, p-values in extended data table a)
Clones were absent in participants ID  and ID  where sample availability was To determine whether defective viruses were also similar between blood and lymph node, we combined intact and defective env sequences from all NFL and VOAs ( sequences) (extended not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
The frequency of GAG+, full-length genomes and intact NFL per  CD+ T cells was not statistically different between peripheral blood and lymph node (figure c)
Thus, in our cohort the frequency of intact and defective HIV- proviruses in CD+ T cells is similar in  full-length env sequences were obtained by SGA from rebound plasma, none of which overlapped with any of the latent reservoir sequences (figure )
To determine whether recombination between latent blood and lymph node viruses could account for the rebound viruses we analyzed intact NFL, and VOA env in all  individuals showed evidence of recombination (figure a, b, i
Single-genome amplification (SGA) and sequencing of HIV- env genes was performed as not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
