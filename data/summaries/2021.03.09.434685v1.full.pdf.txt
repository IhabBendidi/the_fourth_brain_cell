Although studies have suggested that microplastic  ingestion can lead to accumulation of these chemicals in marine organisms, none provided the  direct evidence in fish species
We exposed fish (Myoxocephalus brandti)  to polyethylene microplastics compounded with brominated flame retardants (BFRs; BDE,  DBDPE) and ultraviolet stabilizers (UVs; UV-, UV-, BP-) suspended in the water  column, or to mysids (Neomysis spp
Also, fish fed plastic-exposed mysids accumulated  significantly greater concentrations of BFRs in muscle than fish exposed to microplastics  suspended in the water column (p < 
These results suggests that the relative contribution  between direct ingestion of microplastics from the water column and indirect ingestion via  trophic transfer on tissue accumulation of additives in fish varies among compounds
 Compounds with high molecular weight and high hydrophobicity like BDE and DBDPE  were considered difficult to leach out from plastics, however, our study showed that trophic  transfer of microplastics can facilitate the accumulation of such compounds from plastics to  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
In most cases, however, these  negative effects were observed with unrealistically high exposure concentration in laboratory  experiments (Cunningham and Sigwart, ; Lenz et al, ), and the current monitored  concentration in the ocean is considered to have negligible impacts on organisms because  microplastics can be egested from the body without long-term accumulation (Beiras and   Aside from their physical effects, microplastics also have chemical effects on  organisms
However, some model studies suggested that plastics are not important for the  accumulation of these pollutants in organisms because their concentrations in plastics would  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
In contrast, microplastics may  play a more relevant role in the transfer of chemical additives as they are added to plastic  polymers at high concentrations (~% by weight (Gangi, )), whereas the information  about the tissue accumulation of additives compounded in plastics is still far limited  compared to that of adsorbed pollutants
 While no study has so far provided the direct evidence that microplastic ingestion can lead to  the tissue accumulation of chemicals additives in fish species, Coffin et al () demonstrated  that in vivo fish gut simulated condition using the digestive enzyme enhanced the leaching of  additives from plastics, which suggests that tissue accumulation in fish species is plausible
 Studies using fish species are especially important considering the food web structure of marine  ecosystems and the potential impact on human health through direct consumption (Campanale   There are two possible pathways for predatory fish to ingest microplastics, either from  the water column or their prey (Walkinshaw et al, )
Mysids contained approximately - times higher concentrations of  additives by ingesting microplastics than those from the ambient environment (Fig
In muscle, fish fed plastic-exposed mysids showed the higher concentrations than  those exposed to microplastics suspended in the water column
;    This study provides the first evidence that microplastic ingestion leads to the tissue  accumulation of chemical additives in fish
However, as we observed the equal contribution to the accumulation of UVs between  direct ingestion of microplastics from the water column and indirect ingestion via trophic  Previous studies showed that microplastics can act as a vector for the transfer of  plastic-associated chemicals to marine organisms, but mostly targeted at the environmental  contaminants adsorbed onto plastics, such as PCBs and PAHs (Besseling et al, ; Rochman  et al, )
Several field observation  studies found a positive relationship between plastic ingestion and chemical additives detected  from marine fish and seabirds (Gassel et al, ; Tanaka et al, ), suggesting the potential  occurrence of the tissue transfer of plastic-derived additives in natural environments
 We found that trophic transfer of microplastics has greater effects on the accumulation  of BDE and DBDPE in fish than waterborne ingestion
First, fish was exposed to more chemical  additives by ingesting microplastics via trophic transfer
Higher ingestion rate of microplastics via trophic transfer  should have resulted in the greater exposure intensity of chemical additives in fish stomach
Ingesting  microplastics from mysids, therefore, changed the size composition of plastics in fish stomach,  and may have enhanced the leaching of chemicals
Thus, our study highlights the  importance of indirect exposure via trophic transfer in chemical effects of microplastics on  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Given the  ingestion of microplastics from the water column in fish are much lower than the trophic  transfer (Hasegawa and Nakaoka, ), there could be other accumulation routes in the  waterborne exposure of chemical additives
This study clearly showed the chemical accumulation in  fish following microplastic exposure
  This study is the first to demonstrate that microplastic ingestion can lead to tissue  accumulation of chemical additives in fish
We also revealed that indirect exposure of  microplastics via trophic transfer can enhance the accumulation of BDE and DBDPE that  were assumed difficult to accumulate in organisms because of their low leachability from  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
