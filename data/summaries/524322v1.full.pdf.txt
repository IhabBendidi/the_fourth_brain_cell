This paper reports the results of two randomised controlled experiments looking at the effect of a training methodology designed to increase the recognition of happy emotion in low intensity happy facial expressions
However, there was no evidence that training increased facial expression recognition accuracy, as measured by the Reading the Mind in the Eyes task completed after training was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
;    There is evidence for reduced perceptual sensitivity for certain facial expressions (Doi et al, ; Rump, Giovannelli, Minshew, & Strauss, ; Wallace et al, ) and possible biases forwards recognition of negative emotions in ASD (Evers, Steyaert, Noens, & Wagemans, )
Similarly, Beard and Amir () gave social anxious individuals Recently a CBM procedure has been developed which aims specifically to modify biases in the perception of ambiguous facial expressions (Dalili, Schofield-Toloza, Munaf, & Penton-Voak, ; Penton-Voak, Bate, Lewis, & Munaf, ; Penton-Voak et al, )
In this training, participants are presented, in a random order, with facial expressions from a was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
As the anti-expressions at the end of the sequence do not correspond strongly to a particular emotional state, reducing sensitivity to these anti-procedures have been successfully employed previously (Penton-Voak et al, ; Penton-Voak et al, ), broad difficulties in face processing in ASD (Dawson, Webb, & McPartland, ) may make training with expression morphs unfeasible in this particular population
The feedback phase lasted around  minutes with the baseline and test The proportion of faces each participant judged to be happy at baseline was used to select baseline recognition threshold, corresponding to a particular frame from the morph was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Additionally we looked at correlations between the size of the training effect and level of ASD and depression symptoms to see if these affected the success of training in Additionally we tested whether increasing detection of low intensity happiness using morph sequence training improved the accuracy of expression recognition more generally, using a standardised measure of facial expression perception which has been shown to be Raste, & Plumb, )
