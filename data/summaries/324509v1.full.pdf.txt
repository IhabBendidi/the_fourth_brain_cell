;    In the setting of a clinical trial evaluating the anti-HIV- antibody BNC, Cohen et al demonstrate that rebound viruses that emerge following interruption of antiretroviral therapy are distinct from circulating latent viruses
However, rebound viruses often appear to be A clinical trial was performed to evaluate BNC, a potent anti-HIV- antibody, in infected interruption (ATI)
In conclusion, viruses emerging during ATI in individuals treated with BNC are not the dominant species found in the circulating certified by peer review) is the author/funder
However, therapy needs to be lifelong because it fails to eliminate a reservoir of latent HIV- viruses integrated into the genome of infected cells (Chun et al, ; Finzi et al, )
In addition, bNAb administration is associated with development of potent antiviral CD+ T cell immunity in Infusion of VRC, an anti-CD-binding site antibody, in the setting of continued ART did not measurably alter the size of the latent reservoir in  individuals (Lynch et al, )
;    the sensitivity of circulating reservoir viruses to VRC was not determined and the relationship of latent viruses to plasma viruses that emerge during an analytical treatment interruption (ATI) Here we evaluate the effects of BNC, a broad and potent anti-CD-binding site bNAb (Caskey et al, ; Scheid et al, ; Scheid et al, ) in the setting of continued ART administration and during treatment interruption
We report on the dynamics of resistant and sensitive viruses in the latent HIV reservoir over a -month period prior to ATI, and the underwent ATI (Table , Supplementary Table , and Supplementary Fig
 days, slightly shorter than the half-life of  days in HIV-uninfected individuals, but very similar to that previously reported for individuals receiving ART (Caskey et al, ; Scheid et al, The quantitative and qualitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) was used to examine the effect of BNC on the latent reservoir (Lorenzi et al, )
We conclude that  doses of BNC administered over  weeks in the setting of suppressive ART does not measurably reduce the size of the To examine the molecular nature of the replication-competent viruses in the latent reservoir, we analyzed the latent viruses isolated by QVOA at weeks - and 
The clonal structure of the latent reservoir differed among the participants analyzed and could be divided into three categories: dominated by a single clone (, , ), dominated by multiple clones (, , , , ), or non-certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Overall, % of viral sequences in the reservoir were clonal, which is consistent with prior studies (Bui et al, ; Hosmane et al, ; Lee et al, ; Lorenzi et We observed clonal fluctuations that varied from appearance or disappearance of clones to large alterations in their relative size
We conclude that the size of latent reservoir clones in circulation fluctuates over a -month interval in individuals treated with BNC while on suppressive ART, and that this Participants received  additional doses of BCN at weeks  and  in the setting of ART interruption (Fig
The size of the latent reservoir, as determined by QVOA at week , did not correlate with time to rebound (Fig
;    For many participants, latent viruses exhibited a range of sensitives to BNC and other bNAbs that target distinct epitopes, as previously shown (Lorenzi et al, ) (Supplementary Tables  and )
The BNC IC titer of the most resistant latent virus isolated from each of these participants correlated with time to rebound (p = 
Thus, pre-existing resistance within the latent To assess the neutralization sensitivity of rebound viruses, single genome analysis (SGA) was performed on plasma, and outgrowth cultures were performed using PBMCs obtained at the time of rebound
We conclude that the circulating latent viruses isolated by QVOA are representative of the overall neutralization profile present within the certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Although some rebound viruses were closely related to reservoir viruses in resistant participants, only  of  rebound env sequences obtained were identical to the  QVOA-derived latent viruses isolated from  participants (Fig
Strikingly, even a latent expanded clone with complete resistance to BNC could not be found among rebound viruses (Fig , participant )
We compared the sequences of putative BNC target sites in env obtained from plasma rebound viruses to QVOA-derived sequences from the circulating reservoir for the presence of mutations (Bar et al, ; Caskey et al, ; Cheng et al, ; Lynch et al, ; Scheid et al, )
Near full-length HIV genome analysis (Bruner et al, ; Ho et al, ) was performed on week  samples for participants with QVOA viruses that displayed varying sensitivity, phylogenetic diversity, and clonal structure
For participants  and , whose reservoirs are dominated by a large clone, % of near full-length sequence env genes were identical to QVOA-derived viruses
However, we found no instance of identical near full-length HIV sequences and rebound viruses among the  participants for whom rebound SGA sequences were available (Supplementary Fig
The average Hamming distance between near full-length HIV sequences and rebound viruses was  nucleotides, excluding insertions and deletions, certified by peer review) is the author/funder
We conclude that intact proviral DNA sequences obtained from circulating CD+ T cells overlap with sequences obtained by QVOA To examine the accumulation of mutations during ATI as a potential explanation for the divergence between latent and rebound viruses, we created a mathematical model to simulate this process (Supplementary Fig
Taking into account the possibility of recombination, the observed distance between latent and rebound viruses decreases, and is often close to the range predicted by the mutation simulation model described above (Fig
When participants in a prior trial were pre-screened for sensitivity and received infusions of BNC at time  and  weeks, rebound was delayed for an average of 
 weeks, and an analysis of the reservoir by QVOA revealed that the delay in rebound by BNC monotherapy is directly related to the sensitivity of T cell derived outgrowth viruses found in the circulating reservoir
Expression of viral env in individuals on suppressive ART is limited, and neither BNC nor VRC (Lynch et al, ) infusion altered the size of the HIV reservoir in this setting
Our finding that the distribution of circulating clones of latent cells can change dramatically in a relatively short period of  months indicates that the certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Thus, there is good Although we obtained an average of  latent HIV- sequences for each participant, and % of these were clonal, we only found three instances in which the rebounding virus was identical to a virus in the latent reservoir
However, BNC binding site nucleotide and amino acid variants found in rebound sequences were frequently preexisting in the latent reservoir
By incorporating the possibility of recombination and estimating the number of mutations that might have occurred during the ATI period for each participant, approximately % ( of ) of rebounding viruses could have derived from the observed latent reservoir
Thus, in % of the individuals studied, the latent viruses detected by QVOA or near full-length genome sequencing appeared to have contributed genetic information to the viruses that emerge at the time of rebound
If recombination occurs at the time of rebound, it may have significant implications for understanding the frequency with which latent viruses are In conclusion, by examining the effects of antibody therapy on the circulating reservoir we document its dynamic nature and its relationship to viruses that emerge upon interruption of An open label study was conducted in HIV-infected participants virologically suppressed on to eligibility criteria
