Here we show that restoring tactile sensory feedback,  through intracortical microstimulation of the somatosensory cortex, enables a person with a  bidirectional intracortical brain-computer interface to improve their performance on functional object  transport tasks completed with a neurally-controlled prosthetic limb

The final score was the sum of the best  Prior to these experiments, the participant had performed  ARAT sessions over a period of  months  using several different control schemes, including four preliminary sessions with ICMS-driven tactile  feedback (Fig

Including ICMS did not significantly improve  perfomance with the rock, small cylinder or water pouring task although the median completion time  did go down for all of the objects
However,  for those objects that could be completed more easily, adding ICMS feedback further improved  Prior to conducting the functional tasks each session, BCI decoder performance was tested in the  absence of ICMS-evoked tactile feedback using a random target sequence task
Here, we demonstrated that in  highly-practiced tasks where normal visual feedback was available, adding artificial tactile feedback  through ICMS enabled a person with spinal cord injury using a BCI to significantly improve their task  scores, primarily by spending less time attempting to grasp the objects (Fig
First, using the same fundamental neural  decoding and control methods, we have demonstrated that two participants achieved similar scores on  functional tasks with vision alone, and that these scores were only exceeded when ICMS-evoked  tactile feedback was provided (Fig
;    Ultimately, ICMS-induced tactile percepts improved task performance to levels not previously observed,  decreased the time spent grasping in ways that were analogous to the role of natural tactile sensations  during grasp state transitions, and do not appear to be the result of practice, suggesting that including  naturalistic somatosensory feedback, like that induced with ICMS, could have a major impact on the  This study was conducted under an Investigational Device Exemption from the U

Both the object transfer task and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)  have been successfully performed with vision as the only source of feedback,
;    We also conducted a modified version of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), , which consisted of  moving eight different objects from the left side of a table to a raised platform located on the right side  (Fig
