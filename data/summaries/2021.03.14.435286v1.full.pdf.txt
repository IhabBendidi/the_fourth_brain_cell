Redox Buffering Capacity of Nanomaterials as an Index of ROS-based Therapeutics and Toxicity: A Preclinical Animal StudyDepartment of Chemical, Biological and Macromolecular Sciences, S
, maintenance of physiological level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for mediating normal cellular functions (oxidative eustress) while evading the excess ROS stress (distress) is central to the concept of redox medicine
In other words, information about ROS-mediated changes in cellular redox state, or ability of a nanomaterial to maintain eustress condition could be instrumental in dictating the therapeutic potential of a Unfortunately, the quantitative basis of changes in the intracellular redox state of the cells is not well-defined, thus leading to the dilemma that redox changes induced by oxidants in distinct cells types cannot be predicted []
In this regard it is worth mentioning that, C-MnO NPs has previously been well studied from our group and showed therapeutic efficacy using both ROS generation and ROS scavenging abilities in in vitro as well as in vivo models
;    Furthermore, we went on to study the chronic toxic effect (if any) of this nanomaterial in animal model in order to co-relate with the experimentally estimated redox buffering capacity
This study could function as a framework for assessing the capability of a nanomaterial as redox medicine (whether maintains eustress or damages by creating distress), thus orienting (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
In order to explore the redox buffering effect of C-MnO NPs, we used the DCFH assay and measured the DCF intensity as a quantitative marker of ROS present in the reaction medium
Therefore, when the cells stay at oxidative eustress condition, a dynamic equilibrium is maintained between the generation and elimination of ROS by C-MnO NPs
During this condition the ROS generated by C-MnO NPs can take part in the cellular signalling process and maintain the normal cell functions
The described redox titration method could be beneficial for comparing buffering capacity, as a marker of cyto-compatibility of different nanomaterials Next we evaluated chronic toxicity of C-MnO NPs in animal model
