Here, zebrafish embryos were  exposed to cannabidiol (CBD) and --tetrahydrocannabinol l (THC) until the end of  gastrulation (- hours post-fertilization) and analyzed later in development (- days post- fertilization)
 Overall, we report that CBD toxicity occurs via two cannabinoid receptors and is synergistically  enhanced by THC exposure to negatively impact neural activity late in larval development
Considering the anticipated effects of  THC and CBD, high-throughput quantification of neural activity following early exposures  would be of great interest
 Here, we investigated the effects of the two most abundant cannabinoids found in the  plant, THC and CBD, on neural activity and characterized CBR and CBR in vivo on the CBD  effects in zebrafish
The effects of early THC and CBD exposure from immediately after egg  fertilization until the end of gastrulation, at  hour post-fertilization (hpf), were monitored later  in embryonic development, at  and  days post-fertilization (dpf)
 In this study the objective was to gain insight in the effects of THC and CBD on neural  activity during early embryonic development
 Overall, these results show that CaMPARI, deployed in zebrafish larvae is a reliable high- We sought to assess how embryonic exposure to cannabinoids impacts upon subsequent  neural activity later in development
THC had a similar effect as CBD and  also reduced neural activity at higher doses,  g/ml and  g/ml, (Fig
We compared neural activity and  locomotion in the same individuals exposed to effective doses of cannabinoids and found  significant correlations (Fig
In order to investigate whether CBD and THC have a combined effect that is  different from either compound on its own, neural activity was measured when larvae were  exposed to both cannabinoids, using the same timeline as the previous experiment (Fig
Together, these results  suggest that CBD and THC are more potent in reducing neural activity when applied in  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
In  contrast, CBD-mediated reduction of locomotor activity was prevented with a concentration of  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Intriguingly,  more recently, new evidence revealed that exposure to not only the more widely studied THC,  but also CBD, during gastrulation impacts the overall development in zebrafish
Our goal was to specifically investigate the effects of CBD, how it might  interact with the more widely studied THC during early development and characterize the impact  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
We  found that neural activity was reduced later in zebrafish development upon brief exposure of not  only THC, but also CBD early in development
Overall, CaMPARI is a practical direct output of neural activity and thus the  Both CBD and THC have been implicated in embryonic development including abnormal  changes to neurons
Here, early exposure of CBD and THC during the first  hours of  embryonic development reduced neural activity when measured  days later, in a dose-dependent  manner
Interestingly, CBD seemed to impact  neural activity at a lower concentration than THC, which also aligns with our previous study
;    Overall, both CBD and THC exposure during embryonic stages had a negative impact on  later neural activity, which was additive when combined
Zebrafish larvae were exposed to a series of CBD and THC  concentrations by themselves or in combination, which are mostly sub-effective, or in the case of  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
