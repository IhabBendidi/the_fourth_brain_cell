;    There has been increasing interest in the combination of exposure-based cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders with drugs targeting synaptic plasticity, to improve has been shown to significantly facilitate clinical response to exposure under some conditions (, ), but the optimal methods for combination remain to be further identified and could be informed by characterisation of neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of We have recently developed a single-dose CBT testbed that allows the assessment of early effects of treatment on such neurocognitive markers and their contribution to clinical improvement ()
Administering a single session of exposure therapy for panic disorder led to no clinical changes on the day after treatment, but resulted in a substantial decrease in threat bias for fearful faces
These findings suggest that a reduction of threat bias may be a key mechanism of action in exposure therapy, and they bring forward a single-dose CBT methodology that may help ascertain the Such a focus on the mechanisms underpinning recovery with pharmacological exposure therapy can inform optimal combination of different treatment components, and it can provide This study aimed to characterise the effects of d-cycloserine with single-session CBT on neurocognitive markers important in panic disorder, including threat bias for fearful faces previously shown to mediate clinical effects of single-session CBT () and amygdala threat response previously shown to normalise after four sessions of exposure therapy in panic certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
We hypothesised that the d-cycloserine group compared to placebo would show reduced threat bias and amygdala threat response after single-session CBT, and that the magnitude of these markers would predict clinical symptom changes during follow-up

Group differences on the validated clinical outcome measures and stress test ratings were assessed using linear mixed-effects models, including the factors group and time (next day, -month, -months) and their interaction, and controlling for pre-treatment scores
Following established approaches, we also ran eight separate multiple linear regression analyses to predict whether i) BOLD % amygdala signal change (Maintain block) and ii) threat bias (FDOT) on the day after treatment predicted symptom changes at -month follow-up on the MI, BSQ, ACQ, or PDSS certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
), Threat bias for fearful faces (FDOT) and amygdala response to aversive images were significantly lower in the d-cycloserine compared to the placebo group on the day after treatment
There were no group differences on clinical measures specific to panic disorder, but the drug improved response to an in-vivo stress test and outcome on more global measures of mental health, including state-trait anxiety and depression, with medium to large effects
