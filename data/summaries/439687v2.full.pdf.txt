Finally, most post-FMT species (>  %) could be properly predicted (AUC > %) using a random forest classification  model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT  recipients acting as the most contributive factors for prediction accuracy
;    Purified fresh fecal microbiota suspension was input into patients mid-gut by a tube  within gastroscope under anesthesia, and the entire procedure should be done within  DNA extraction and metagenomic sequencing of IBD fecal samples and healthy fecal  samples were performed at BGI-Shenzhen, China following HiSeq  sequencing  performed at the Genomics Core Facility of the European Molecular Biology  Illumina sequencing reads were quality controlled by trimming low quality bases  (quality score < ), filtering adapter reads, and removing host-related reads after  mapping to the human genome database
The diversity of each gut microbiota community per sample  was calculated based on its mOTUs profile, referred to as the Shannon index, using the  certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Strain differentiation, which was determined by  comparing the presence or absence of donor-specific, recipient-specific, and previously  certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Similar to the process of determining species retention  and transplantation, the gut microbiota composition of post-FMT recipients was  common strains (shared by donor and recipient)
The inputs for these predictions are the gut microbiota composition of each  pre-FMT patient and their corresponding donor at a species level, along with clinical  metadata of the pre-FMT recipient and donor
Three days after FMT treatment, the average  Shannon indexes of both CD and UC recipients had not significantly improved  certified by peer review) is the author/funder
%) (Figure  S), showing that the increased variations of gut microbiota in post-FMT patients  could be attributed to donor strain transfer instead of temporal variability
 While the phenomenon of donor strain establishment occurred in both CD and UC  recipients, UC patients were more susceptible to external sources of microbiota (Figure  certified by peer review) is the author/funder
We also observed that same-donor  recipients undergo varying degrees of gut microbiome shifts, implying that the FMT  treatment effect may be patient-specific, and raising the possibility of patient  certified by peer review) is the author/funder
