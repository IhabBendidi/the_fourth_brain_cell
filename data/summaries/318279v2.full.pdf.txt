When Attention bias modification training (ABM) leads to more positive emotional biases, associated changes in clinical symptoms have been reported
A broader and more transparent picture of the true advantage of ABM based on larger and more Aims: To evaluate the early effect of two weeks ABM training on blinded clinician-rated Method: A total of  patients with a history of depression were included in a emotional ABM paradigm over fourteen days or a closely matched control condition
Symptoms based on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) were obtained at baseline and after ABM training
Results: ABM training led to significantly greater decrease in clinician-rated symptoms of depression as compared to the control condition
In addition, some potential techniques for altering AB have failed to modify AB as part of the treatment programme, which limits their ability to The main objective of our study was to test the early efficacy of ABM in a large group of previously depressed patients, but with residual symptoms using a preregistered trial design
We hypothesized that two weeks of ABM training would reduce clinician- and self-reported residual symptoms of depression, as compared to a matched control condition
Given the clear mechanistic role for altered bias in the clinical effects of ABM, we predicted a change towards more positive biases in the ABM group and that this certified by peer review) is the author/funder
The period of recruitment and follow-up was January  to October  and was first posted in A total of  participants with a history of Major Depressive Episodes (MDE) were randomised to receive ABM or placebo
Outcome assessors and participants were therefore blind to allocation The primary outcome measures were The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) () and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) () administered to assess both clinician - and self evaluations of symptoms
P-values from Pearson There was a statistically significant difference (time) between ABM and the control condition in blinded clinician-rated symptoms as measured by the HRSD [F (,)=
] indicating that the observed changes in There was no statistically significant difference in self-reported depression as measured by the BDI-II between the ABM and the control condition [F (,)=
As found for self-reported depression (BDI-II) general symptom improvement was found in both ABM and in the A repeated measure ANOVA with depression status (current MDD) and intervention as fixed factors revealed a statistically significant interaction between HRSD (time) and depression status [F (,)=
The results show that blinded rated symptoms was higher in current depression and decrease relative to placebo after ABM Two weeks of ABM training significantly reduced blinded clinician-rated symptoms as compared to a control condition in a group of patients previously treated for depression and with various degrees of residual symptoms
Post hoc exclusion of participants with high HRSD scores had no impact on the ABM effect, and per protocol analyses showed that the results are robust against imputations and compliance rates
In another recent study, fifty-two participants in a major depressive episode (MDE) was recruited for ABM training and a similar significant change in BDI-II in both the ABM- and placebo was found ()
