Although age was not usedas an attribute, we have found that subjects in the three clusters have ainsulin levels in fasting and postprandial and between glucose levels inDiabetes is a progressive disease characterized by high blood glucose levels due to poorperformance in the production or action of insulin [, ]
Some studies have explored the characterization of diabeticsin more specific groups with particular characteristics, the results of these investiga-tions have revealed that a more specific characterization of diabetic patients couldimprove the quality of life of diabetic patients by designing treatments more appro-priate to their type of diabetes and even avoid long-term diabetic complications suchFasting and postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels defined in the literatureare used to identify prediabetic and diabetic conditions
In this sense, we propose to divide thedata set into three groups using the k-means algorithm, which allows to find naturalgroups in the data set by means of a similarity measure based on the distance betweenindividuals, in such a way that the individuals within the same cluster are similarto each other and share the same attributes (characteristics) and these in turn arenot certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
The measure-ment of the concentration of insulin in the blood is carried out with specializedequipment in a clinical laboratory, therefore, it is an expensive procedure thatnot certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Then,the optimal number of clusters is the one that provides the highest average SilhouetteWe computed the mean and standard deviation of the variables age, and fasting andpostprandial glucose and insulin levels of the subjects assigned to the clusters
Moreover, the results of the clusteringalgorithm are in accordance with the diagnostic values of diabetes and prediabetesstated by the American Diabetes Association []: cluster C contains prediabetics,not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
