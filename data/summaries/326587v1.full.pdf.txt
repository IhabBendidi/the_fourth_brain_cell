 In a double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial, we assigned  adult TBM patients in  Bandung, Indonesia, to standard  mg,  mg or  mg (,  and  mg/kg) oral rifampicin combined  with other TB drugs for  days
Endpoints included pharmacokinetic measures, adverse events and survival  A double and triple dose of oral rifampicin led to three and five-fold higher geometric mean total exposures in  plasma in the critical early days () of treatment (AUC-h:  mg

We performed a series of studies to evaluate higher  A first open-label, randomised phase II clinical trial showed that a % higher dose of rifampicin administered  intravenously ( mg/kg iv) for two weeks led to a three-fold higher exposure to rifampicin in plasma and CSF  during the first critical days of treatment, and a strong reduction in mortality at six months after the treatment  started (adjusted HR , % CI -)
() We found a clear concentration-effect relationship and  derived threshold values for lower mortality, whereas our data suggested that the highest desirable exposures  However, intravenous rifampicin is not widely available in low to middle-income countries, is expensive, and  must be administered by healthcare workers, which is impractical over a longer period of time or unfeasible  after discharge from the hospital Our second open-label pharmacokinetic study was conducted; doses of  or   mg/kg of oral rifampicin resulted in average total exposures in plasma (area under the concentration versus  time curves, AUC-h) that were approximately similar to the values after  mg/kg iv, but average peak plasma  Both our first and second clinical trial called for the evaluation of doses of rifampicin higher than  mg/kg  intravenously and - mg/kg orally
The current study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety/tolerability, and  efficacy of higher (up to  mg/kg) doses of oral rifampicin as TBM treatment
;    All patients over  years old (adults) with clinically suspected meningitis who presented themselves at Hasan  Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia (the referral hospital for West Java) between December  and  November  had an initial screening that included standard CSF tests, blood measurements, and chest  TBM was classified as definite (microbiologically proven) if either CSF microscopy for acid-fast bacilli,  Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture, or PCR results were positive
Similarly, CSF concentrations decreased from day  to day  of the treatment, but plasma Cmax values  Adverse events during the  days after start of study drugs were equally distributed over the groups (Table )
Rifampicin AUC-h and Cmax values in those with and without grade  or  adverse events were  The administration of higher doses of rifampicin increased the percentage of patients who achieved AUC-h  and Cmax plasma threshold values for decreased mortality, as derived from our first clinical trial() (Table )
 This study revealed that tripling the standard dose of oral rifampicin strongly increased the exposure to this  pivotal TB drug in plasma and CSF, did not increase the incidence of grade  and  adverse events, improved  the attainment of previously determined exposure threshold values for lower mortality, and showed a trend for a  lower six-month mortality rate among patients with microbiologically proven (definite) TBM
(, )  As to efficacy, tripling the dose of oral rifampicin for a period of  days led to an increase in the attainment of  plasma AUC-h and Cmax thresholds for decreased mortality and highlighted a trend in survival benefit among  those with microbiologically proven (definite) TBM
