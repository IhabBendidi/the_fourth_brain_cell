;    While mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are an appealing therapeutic option for a range of clinical  applications, their potential to induce clotting when used systemically remains a safety concern,  particularly in hypercoagulable conditions, such as in patients with severe COVID-, trauma, or cancers
The potential for these bioreactor MSCs to induce clots in  coagulable plasma was compared against free MSCs, as a model of systemic administration, which  were directly injected into the circuit
Here, we used a MSC bioreactor platform to assay whether limiting the direct exposure of  fresh frozen pooled plasma from healthy patients to MSCs, and therefore the available tissue factor and  phosphatidylserine of the MSCs, would affect clot formation time (CFT) in a modified plasma-based clot  formation assay [, ]
Results from our  assays showed that the direct injection (DI) of freshly thawed MSCs into the plasma flow circuit  significantly hastened the onset of clot formation when compared to circuits using bioreactor housed  MSCs
However, when  comparing similarly seeded MRs to direct injection with the same number of cells, CFT was significantly  slower in the groups where MSCs were housed in the bioreactor (Figure B)
 Immobilizing MSCs in the bioreactor allows for cell recovery post-thaw, a process proposed to reduce  the surface exposure of pro-coagulation factors []
In order to investigate the effect of recovering  MSCs on clot formation, two known pro-coagulant factors- tissue factor and phosphatidylserine - were  measured prior to perfusion
Flow cytometric analysis of the surface markers on both the freshly thawed  and MSCs allowed to recover for  hours in culture, showed that cell recovery had significantly lowered  the levels of phosphatidylserine and tissue factor (Figure A)
Interestingly, perfusion of coagulable plasma  through bioreactors seeded with MSCs resulted in clotting at rates significantly slower than their  comparable direct injection groups, suggesting that free, circulating MSCs increase thrombosis risk more  than bioreactor immobilized MSCs
Like the direct injection group, the MSC dose seeded in the  bioreactor was predictive of CFT with higher doses inducing quicker clots, likely through the increased  production of pro-coagulable MSC factors
However, recovery of cells for  hours post thaw did reduce clot formation potential This  was shown to correlate with surface marker expression of tissue factor and phosphatidylserine
Further removal of cellular byproducts through saline  flushing of the bioreactor further reduces the MSC based clot formation potential Additional heparin  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
