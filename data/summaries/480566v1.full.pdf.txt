This was a double-blind placebo-controlled study with two  between subject factors of drug (varenicline, placebo) and CBM (attend towards  smoking cues, train away from smoking cues, control training) that recruited daily (>   cigarettes per day) non-treatment seeking smokers
Participants (n = , % female)  were randomised to one-week of drug administration (varenicline or placebo) before  attending a study session at which they were randomised to CBM condition, and  underwent an fMRI scan were they were presented with smoking and neutral cues
These data suggest that CBM does not  modify cognitive bias, subjective craving and mood, or neural response to smoking  cues
 attention allocation to drug cues, have been reported in users of a number of drugs  and have been positively associated with drug craving (Field, Munafo, & Franken,  ; Wakefield, Germain, & Henriksen, ), future drug use (Cox, Pothos, &  Hosier, ), approach behaviours to drug-related cues (Franken, ) and  increased likelihood of relapse (Marissen, Franken, Blanken, van den Brink, &  Hendriks, )

The weak effects may be due to the limited  number of sessions used in laboratory-based studies and that multiple session  approaches may be more efficacious than single session CBM (Lopes, Pires, &  Bizarro, ; McHugh, Murray, Hearon, Calkins, & Otto, ; Unrod et al, )
