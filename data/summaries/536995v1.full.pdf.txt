Conducting this trial with a full waiver of consent would have allowed more patients in the intervention arm to receive the home testing kits and likely more screening completions
Further research is needed to evaluate home testing strategies using quantitative or semi-quantitative ACR for screening and confirmation of albuminuria, and to determine whether increasing albuminuria screening can improve patient-centered kidney and cardiovascular certified by peer review) is the author/funder
