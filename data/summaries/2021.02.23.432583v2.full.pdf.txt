IN is the key enzyme involved in incorporating viral DNA into the host CD cells through two distinct steps: (a) -processing of the viral DNA to form -OH recessed ends and (b) stabilizing the IN-DNA complex (intasome) for the -OH of the viral DNA to attack the dolutegravir and bictegravir; Figure ) whilst another agent (cabotegravir; Figure ) was (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
 Indeed, several regression QSAR models for HIV- INSTIs have been reported based on techniques such models are specific to particular classes of HIV- INSTIs such as carboxylic acid pyridinone (trained on  compounds), -diketo-acids (trained on  on compounds) (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Explanation and correlation of the molecular descriptors to the We applied four base learners, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) and K* algorithms to predict the pIC of the inhibitors in the training set
In this test, the pIC of the compounds in the training sets were randomly shuffled and (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
This indicated that our machine learning algorithms were prone to overfitting the data and this phenomenon was similarly observed by Darnag et al However, none of the random regression QSAR models had any predictability power when evaluated using the external test set (Figure d and d)

Judging from this, we have decided to deploy both AR-RF and AR-K* models to predict potential HIV- (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Although both drugs were not reported directly to have HIV- activity, the N-phenylpicolinamide moiety of verubecestat and the ,,-oxadiazole moiety of epacadostat were reported to carry inhibitory activity against (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
;    Following on, we selected the top three compounds  itacitinib, rosuvastatin and verubecestat  for molecular docking studies to explore the binding interactions of these compounds with HIV- IN
We selected three top scoring compounds  itacitinib, rosuvastatin and verubecestat  for molecular docking to study the protein-inhibitor interaction
