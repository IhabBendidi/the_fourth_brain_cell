Although these therapies are successful in most patients, there is a significant subset ofindividuals (approximately %) who do not adequately respond to treatment and are consideredStructures  related  to  the  control  of  aggressive  behavior  include  the  prefrontal  cortex,amygdala,  hypothalamus  and  midbrain  periaqueductal  gray
Lesion studies performed in the lateth and  early  th centuries  have  shown  that  the  removal  of  the  temporal  lobes  or  selectiveamygdala ablation resulted in marked reduction of aggressive behavior in humans and nonhumanprimates,

In particular, to date, nostudy has attempted to identify and characterize the brain morphology and changes associated withWe  addressed  the  crucial  gap  in  understanding  the  aggressive  brain  circuitry  and  howstructural  and  functional  changes  in  this  network  relate  to  behavior  changes  by  studyinglongitudinal  local  volume and structure changes throughout  the whole brain and examining theclinical and hormonal effects of bilateral amygdala radiofrequency ablation in a small cohort ofBehavior  assessments  demonstrated  a  marked  reduction  in  aggressive  behavior  in  allpatients  (p:
