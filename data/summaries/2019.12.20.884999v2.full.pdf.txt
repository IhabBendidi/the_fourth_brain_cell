Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map hemocytes across different inflammatory conditions in larvae

Importantly, CCs and LMs are required for survival upon injury or immunogenic conditions in Drosophila, highlighting the significance of these specialized blood Traditionally, the classification of hemocytes is based on two major criteria: cell morphology (Rizki, , ; Shrestha and Gateff, ) and expression of a few marker genes (Evans et al, , ; Kurucz et al, )
In particular, scRNA-seq is powerful not only for identifying cell types but also resolving cell states and their dynamic gene expression patterns that are often buried in bulk RNA measurements (Trapnell, )
For example, recent studies using various scRNA-seq platforms have helped identify novel subtypes within monocytes and dendritic cells (Villani (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Here, we performed scRNA-seq of Drosophila hemocytes in unwounded, wounded, and parasitic wasp infested larvae to comprehensively distinguish mature cell types from their transient intermediate states
Our scRNA-seq analysis identifies novel marker genes to existing cell types and distinguishes activated states within PMs enriched in various genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle, metabolism, and antimicrobial response
Interestingly, our scRNA-seq revealed the expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor breathless (btl) and its ligand branchless (bnl), in rare subsets of LMs and CCs, respectively, which we implicate in regulating effective immune responses against parasitoid wasp eggs in vivo
Altogether, our scRNA-seq analysis documents the diversity of hemocyte cell populations circulating in the fly blood and provides a resource of gene expression profiles of the various cell types and their states in Drosophila
org/scRNA/blood/) where genes  Hemocyte differentiation can be induced in Drosophila larvae by mechanical wounding or oviposition by wasps such as Leptopilina boulardi (Rizki and Rizki, )
Based on known marker genes, we confidently assigned certain clusters as plasmatocytes (PMs marked by Hemolectin [Hml]), crystal cells (CCs marked by lozenge [lz]), or lamellocytes (LMs marked by Atilla) (Fig
We determined PM as the cycling or self-renewing state of PMs based on the expression of genes related to cell cycle such as CycB, stg, and polo, which are markers of G/M stages of the cell cycle (Edgar and OFarrell, ; Glover, ; Whitfield et al, )
Further, our scRNA-seq identified two distinct clusters, PM and , expressing several genes that encode antimicrobial peptides (AMP) (Fig
Based on the expression of PPO and PPO together with the gene encoding the Runt related transcription factor Lz, two clusters were assigned to CCs: CC and CC (Fig
Hence, we consider CC to represent mature CCs, while CC may represent an immature or a transient intermediate  LMs represent the rarest cell type, the numbers of which dramatically increase during wounding and wasp infestation (Mrkus et al, ; Rizki and Rizki, )
Based on the expression of the LM marker gene Atilla (Evans et al, ; Kurucz et al, ), we assigned two clusters to LMs: LM and LM (Fig
Altogether, our scRNA-seq analysis recovered all major cell types within the hemocyte repertoire including the fine-grained dissection of PMs into self-renewing or cell-cycle (PM) and various immune-activated states (PM-)
We also identified two clusters each for CCs and LMs, which display differential expression of their marker genes, PPO and Atilla, respectively (Fig
DEG analysis over pseudotime revealed four major clusters depending on the expression of marker genes at the beginning (pre-branch) and end of the pseudotime interval along Lineage and  (Fig
Moreover, the expression of the cell cycle genes gradually decrease as the lineages progress towards  or  (Fig

With regards to the PM cluster of immune-activated state, CecA showed an increased expression specifically in wasp inf
In line with the scRNA-seq data, in vivo imaging analysis revealed distinct populations of CCs within the sessile hub, with CCs displaying differential intensities of GFP and mCherry (Fig
As noted above, PPOhigh CCs express many of the mature CC marker genes, including PPO (Fig
Besides spz, PPOlow CCs express cell cycle/chromatin associated genes such as the Decondensation factor  (Df) and HmgD (Fig
The last cluster was annotated as CC based on extremely low or no expression of Atilla and enrichment of CC marker genes including PPO (Fig
We speculate that LM may represent a LMint state based on the low level of Atilla together with enrichment of PM marker genes such as Pxn and Hml, which are usually not expressed upon LM maturation (Fig
;    observations suggest that LMs may require specialized sugar transporters for their maturation to elicit an  In addition to the expression of the sugar transporters, all LM sub-clusters are enriched in a water transporter, Drip (AQP in humans), which has recently been shown to play a role in T-cell proliferation and activation in mice (Nicosia et al, ) (Fig
However, Drip+ GFP cells, significantly increased upon wounding, and strikingly, the expression of Drip was detected in ~% of Atilla+ LMs (Fig
Finally, the smaller clusters of LMs, LM and LM, were also enriched in genes similar to those expressed in LM, albeit at a lower level (Fig
In summary, LM sub-clustering identified the LMint state together with novel marker genes specific to scRNA-seq uncovers a novel role for the FGF pathway in immune response  To identify signaling pathways enriched in each cluster, we performed pathway enrichment analysis on the scRNA-seq data across all conditions (Fig
To confirm the expression of bnl in hemocytes upon wounding, we used bnl-lexA; lexAOp-GFP, BcF-mCherry larvae and found that bnl expression was restricted either to CCs or PMs but not LMs (Fig
In addition, based on bnl expression counts from scRNA-seq, bnl may be enriched in PPOhigh compared to PPOlow CCs (Fig
Similar to wounding, we also determined that bnl is expressed in subsets of CCs and PMs but not in LMs h post infestation (PI) of bnl-lexA; lexAOp-mCherry larvae (Fig
On the other hand, total blood cell number including Hml+ PMs, and CCs remained unaltered in uninfested control larvae (Fig
Srp is well expressed in all blood cells including LMs (Fig
Moreover, none of the cell types, including CCs, displayed any changes in their numbers in uninfested control or btl-i larvae (Fig
Studies using lineage tracing methods such as G-TRACE (Evans et al, ) or CRISPR-based in vivo cellular barcoding techniques (Kebschull and Zador, ; Spanjaard et al, ) may help further characterize the contribution Immune-activated states: PM from our scRNA-seq data is enriched in several metabolic genes including gapdh and lactate dehydrogenase/Ldh, strongly suggesting that PM is metabolically active
The FGF ligand bnl and its receptor btl were among the genes identified in rare subsets of CCs and LMs, respectively, highlighting the power of scRNA-seq in capturing and detecting these small populations of cells
Based on our in vivo data, we propose that Bnl+ CCs interact with Btl+ LMs to coordinate LM differentiation and possible migration towards parasitoid wasp eggs (Fig
