Implanted Nerve Electrical Stimulation allows to Selectively Restore Hand and Forearm Movements in Patients with a Complete TetraplegiaWafa Tigra, PhD, is an independent researcher and was with MXM, Vallauris, France and INRIA, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, FranceChristine Azevedo, PhD, is with INRIA, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, FranceAnthony Gelis, MD, PhD, is with Propara Neurological Center, Montpellier, FranceDavid Guiraud, PhD, is with INRIA, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, FranceBackground : Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is used for decades inrehabilitation centers
For patients with a spinal cord injury (SCI), FES canTo this last aim, FES external devices can be used, but elicit imprecise move-implantation of one electrode for each site (muscle) to stimulate, an heavy sur-gical procedure and  times more electrical charges than nerve stimulation
The purpose of this work is to evaluate whether a multi-contact nerve cuff electrode can selectively activate forearm and hand musclescertified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Alternative activation of agonist muscles could reduce muscleIn this study, we describe an approach based exclusively on neural stimulation to restore handmovements through a twelve contacts cuff electrode placed around upper-arm nerve (radial ormedian)
For  patients (P, P,P) on , we were able to activate one more muscles when the configuration was repeated atcertified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
