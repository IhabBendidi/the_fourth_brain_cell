Inscre allele was used to delete Insr specifically in -cells of both female and male mice which were compared to Inscre-containing littermate controls at multiple ages and on multiple diets
We did not observe improved glucose tolerance in adult male mice or in high fat diet-fed mice, corroborating the prediction that global insulin resistance obscures the effects of -cell specific insulin resistance
Collectively, our data show that loss of -cell Insr alone is sufficient to drive glucose-induced hyperinsulinemia, thereby improving glucose homeostasis in otherwise insulin sensitive dietary and Type  diabetes is a multifactorial disease wherein several cell types, most prominently pancreatic -cells, are dysfunctional prior to and after diagnosis (Prentki and Nolan, )
We previously did not detect robust exocytosis or C-peptide release from human -cells in response to exogenous insulin despite observed changes in Ca+ release (Luciani and Johnson, Whether chronic changes in autocrine insulin signaling affect -cell development, survival and adaptation conditions is also controversial Mice with chronically reduced insulin production have (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
We also reported insulin is sufficient to increase proliferation of cultured primary mouse -cells and that blocking insulin secretion with somatostatin blunts proliferation induced by hyperglycemia in vitro (Beith et al, ) and that the majority of glucose-dependent changes in gene expression in MIN cells are Insr-dependent (Ohsugi et al, )
Using this and related models, they reported that mice lacking -cell Insr have profound glucose intolerance, and frank diabetes in some cases, due to impaired glucose stimulated insulin secretion, Glut loss, and insufficient -cell mass (Kulkarni et al, ; Okada et al, ; Otani et al, )
More recently, Wang and colleagues studied the roles of -cell Insr in utero and in adult mice using an inducible Ins-CreER transgenic mouse model (Oakie et al, ; Wang et al, ), but these studies are confounded by the presence of the human growth hormone (hGH) minigene (Oropeza et al, ), which necessitates In the present study, we used the constitutive InsCre knock-in strain with robust and specific recombination in -cells (Thorens et al, ) to precisely reduce insulin receptor signaling and define the impacts of -cell specific insulin resistance on glucose homeostasis
Significantly upregulated individual mRNAs in InsrKO mice included genes that promote insulin secretion (Jak, Atpap), mediate cell death (Tmem, Dusp, Rela) and mitochondria fragmentation (Cers), and repress -cell maturity (Dusp) and proliferation (Rela, Kras), or participate in islet development (Tmsf)(Anderson et al, ; Chamberlain et al, ; Dai et al, ; Gomez-Banoy et al, ; Ma et al, ; Mandrup-Poulsen, ; Zhang et al, )
Individual genes that were significantly decreased included regulators of -cell function, including the regulation of KATP channels, and -cell fate (Brsk, Raba, Bmpr, Camkb, Mapkip), a negative regulator of Glut protein abundance (Prnp), a regulator of endocytosis (Vps), a mediator of autophagy and cellular cholesterol traffic (Gramda), an anti-apoptosis gene (Rel), a transducer of ER stress (Atfb), and a histone methyltransferase and STAT target gene (Mettl)(Ashok and Singh, ; Engin et al, ; Fornoni et al, ; Frau et al, ; Goulley et al, ; Gu et al, ; Kline et al, ; Laraia et al, ; Locke et al, ; Mokhtari et al, ; Tobi et al, ; Wang et al, ; Yaekura et al, ; Yang et al, ; Zhang et al, )
Together, analysis of upregulated and downregulated genes points to the possibility that -cells lacking Insr may exhibit increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion but We also used unbiased protein-protein interaction network analysis to examine the relationships between the differentially expressed genes, as well as known components of the insulin signaling pathways
;    cells from female InsrKO mice confirmed a significant increase in action potential firing frequency during glucose stimulation, when compared to control -cells, with no differences in resting potential, firing threshold, or action potential height (Fig
In agreement with the electrophysiological data, Insr knockout -cells from female mice exhibited a significantly greater number of oscillation peaks within the glucose stimulation period compared to control cells (Fig
Islets from female  week-old InsrKO and InsrHET mice secreted more insulin in response to  mM glucose and  mM KCl compared to islets from control mice (Fig
In accordance with our ex vivo insulin secretion data, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was higher in female, but not in male InsrKO mice compared with control mice (Fig
We further tested whether in vivo insulin secretion would be potentiated after a single bolus of glucose in mice with reduced -cell Insr
In accordance with the electrophysiology, Ca+ oscillation, and islet perifusion data, we detected no statistical difference between female genotypes in fasting plasma insulin in vivo at multiple ages (Fig
Together, these experiments suggest that -cell Insr can play suppressive role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion Effects of -cell Insr loss on insulin production, storage, processing and clearance  Insulin and insulin signaling can modulate protein synthesis in many cell types and we have previously provided evidence that soluble cellular insulin protein transiently increases in human islet cell cultures treated with exogenous insulin (Luciani and Johnson, )
To assess the quantitative contribution of Insr signaling to insulin production and mRNA translation rates we measured total islet (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
To investigate the role of Insr signaling on -cell stress and insulin clearance, we conducted analysis of plasma proinsulin to C-peptide ratios, and C-peptide to insulin ratios in the fasting state (h) across multiple ages in both male and female mice, and on multiple diets (Fig
In comparison to control mice, HFD fed female InsrKO mice had a tendency toward a smaller -cell area at  weeks of age that were consistent with tendencies towards lower plasma insulin (Fig
Prolonged hyperglycemia can stimulate -cell proliferation in adult mouse -cells (Sharma et al, ), but whether this requires intact insulin receptor signaling remains controversial To examine the role of Insr-mediated signaling on hyperglycemia-induced -cell proliferation, we performed -day hyperglycemic infusions in InsrKO and wild type control mice
The fact that we did not observe a suppression of glucose-induced proliferation of -cells lacking Insr prompted us to determine the degree to which the broadly defined insulin signaling pathway was inhibited in our model
As described in the methods section, we modified the Topp model (Topp et al, ) to include insulin receptor-mediated negative feedback on insulin secretion, as indicated by our experimental data, with S serving as the -cell Insr-specific insulin sensitivity parameter (see equations in Fig
In silico glucose tolerance tests found that decreased -cell insulin-sensitivity (S) (similar to InsrKO mice) corresponded with elevated peak and plateau insulin secretion (Fig
To test our theoretical model experimentally, we examined glucose tolerance in female and male InsrKO, InsrHET, and control littermates at multiple ages between  and  weeks in the context of two diets
Significant improvements in glucose tolerance were observed in female mice with reduced Insr signaling at multiple ages, and in young males (Fig
Consistent with our mathematical modelling that suggested a diminished contribution of -cell insulin resistance to glucose homeostasis in the context of greater whole-body insulin resistance, we did not observe significant effects of genotype in older male mice, or mice of either sex fed an insulin-resistance-inducing HFD (Fig
Thus, Insr deletion has little consequence on glucose tolerance in mice with already impaired pan-tissue insulin resistance, which we and others have shown increases with age and is more The Inscre allele results in pre-natal gene deletion (Thorens et al, )
Interestingly, insulin sensitivity was significantly improved in -week-old female InsrHET mice compared to littermate controls without Insr deletion (Fig
Consistent with a narrow range of responsiveness, our results also show that the contribution of autocrine insulin feedback to glucose homeostasis depends on whether mice are on a diet or at an age where insulin resistance is high, and potentially saturated in -cells
In isolated human islets, perifusion studies showed that treatment with physiological doses of insulin had no effect on C-peptide release (Johnson and Misler, b), while static incubation experiments found only moderate potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with super-physiological levels of insulin (Braun et al, )
Our mechanistic finding that Insr knockout -cells have increased action potential firing frequency is consistent with previous observations that insulin directly increased KATP currents via PI-kinase signaling (Khan et al, ) and that PI-kinase inhibition with wortmannin potentiates glucose stimulated insulin secretion in normal, but not TD, human islets (Kolic et al, )
Our studies further illustrate the molecular mechanisms of negative autocrine Beyond the potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, transcriptomic analysis of fully and partially Insr-deficient -cells revealed a broad re-wiring of multiple signaling pathways and gene networks that are expected to change how these cells respond to stresses
We observed propensity for excessive diet-induced body mass gain in mice with -cell specific insulin resistance, as well as Insr protein down-regulation in the liver
Indeed, -cell Insr loss led to increased -cell action potentials, calcium oscillations, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in -week-old female mice, but not in age-matched males
To this point, glucose tolerance is improved in -week-old InsrKO males, an age at which control males remain insulin-sensitive, and in male mice with acute loss of Insr
A further caveat is that the molecular mechanisms involved in insulin secretion may be different in mouse and human -cells (Rorsman and Ashcroft, ), although we note that direction of effect we surmise agrees with the majority of human and canine studies, indicating general agreement across species (Cavallo-Perin et al, ; Elahi et al, ; Iversen and Miles, ; Rappaport et al, )
-cell resistance) in insulin secretion, glucose homeostasis and body mass, which depend on the physiological context studied
Cq=Cq(Insr)-Cq(Hprt) followed by normalization of the Cq(exp) to the mean of the Hprt expression To generate transcriptomic data from -cells lacking Insr and littermate controls, groups of  islets were dispersed using mild trypsin digest according to our standard protocol (Alejandro et al, ; Luciani and Johnson, ), and FACS purified based on the GFP-positivity of the InsCre-induced nTnG allele
Parameter values for the glucose and insulin equations were modified by hand so that the model matched a typical wildtype female low-fat-diet glucose tolerance test time series and predicted the observed beta cell mass in these mice
(A,B) Perifused islets isolated from  week old chow-fed control, InsrHET, InsrKO (A) female (n=,,), and (B) male (n=,,) mice were exposed to  mM glucose (G),  mM glucose (G), (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
