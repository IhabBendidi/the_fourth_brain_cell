Through structure-activity relationship studies, ONG was identified as a more potent Methods: A set of cell imaging studies, transcriptomic analyses, and in vivo mouse model (NASH) model were conducted to explore how ONG exhibits both anti-fibrotic and anti-investigated in RAW

One notable feature associated with eupatilin was able to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which plays a central role in initiation and Furthering these intriguing therapeutic capabilities, a more effective and stable analog of eupatilin, called ONG, was generated and subjected to ameliorating fibrogenesis and inhibiting the various disease activities associated with pMFB
We found that ONG was a potent inhibitor of TGF biogenesis such that binding of active TGF to TGF receptor (TGFR) was limited, resulting in cessation of TGFR signaling and EMT was completely inhibited, of a hybrid interactome comprising of a major nuclear reprogramming one and a minor residual fibrogenic interactome, suggesting that ONG is a driver of cell reversion as we saw in the previous study of eupatilin
It turned out that ONG was able to block macrophages-chemoattracting proteins called chemokines and directly acted on macrophages, resulting in not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
This observation may open a door as a powerful new therapeutic modality for treating IPF as well as liver fibrosis not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
As seen in Supplementary Figure , ONG was rapidly detected from the plasma, lung, liver or When ONGHEPA (mouse HSC cels) or DHLF (diseased human lung fibroblasts from IPF patients) were stimulated with TGF, expression of SMA (-smooth muscle actinin) was notable but was then substantially mitigated with the treatment of ONG (Figure A for ONGHEPA and Supplementary Figure  for DHLF)
As shown in Figure C, actin filaments were apparent in TGF-stimulated cells not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
While a massive actin depolymerization was observed with the treatment of ONG no such depolymerization was seen in ONGHEAPA cells stimulated with pirfenidone or nintedanib, suggesting that the latter two anti-IPF drugs have little or no effects on F-actin depolymerization
;    ONG was able to block the induction of NOX, CCL and CCL (Figure E), suggesting that ONG could modulate migration of macrophages to the liver and inflammation in the During the course of this study, it has occurred to our attention that ONG treatment alone reversed the cell fate of pMFB into an intermediate non-pathogenic cell type
To have a deeper understanding on a potential mechanism of cell reversion, we established a series of continual differentiation experiments by using ONGHEPA, which could be a unique in vitro model, in such a way that morphological changes as well as interactome changes were established by stimulating ONGHEPA cells with TGF for  hr after which the resultant myofibroblasts were washed off with buffer and were subjected to TGF plus ONG or ONG alone (data not shown) for  hr because the combinatorial treatment seemed to be more pertinent to in vivo situation
To determine if this remarkable reversion process has to do with nuclear reprogramming, we extensively analyzed global gene expression changes at each not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
A greatest reduction in collagen production was observed at ONG  or mpk, whereas no significant inhibition was noted at ONG mpk as well as at pirfenidone mpk (Figure A), suggesting that larger exposure of ONG may be needed to cope with existing lung fibrosis in therapeutic model
On the contrary, no significant improvement of NASH was noted and little degree of inhibition of fibrosis was also observed with the treatment of OCA mpk not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
