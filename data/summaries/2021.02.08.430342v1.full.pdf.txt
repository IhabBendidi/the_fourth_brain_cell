SMR analysis identified two novel genes whose expression levels were likely involved in the putative causality of type  diabetes on Our results provided robust evidence supporting a causal effect of type  diabetes on the risk of cataract in East Asians, and posed new paths on guiding prevention and early-stage diagnosis  We utilized genome-wide association studies of type  diabetes and cataract in a large Japanese population-based cohort and find a strong genetic overlap underlying the two putative causal effect of type  diabetes on the development of cataract
;     Our study provided theoretical fundament at the genetic level for improving early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of cataract in type  diabetes patients in clinical practice (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Another Asian population-based study recruited , participants and identified diabetes as a significant risk The phenotypic association between type  diabetes and cataract could be partially explained by their shared genetics, 
As pieces of evidence for disclosing their shared genetics, Lee et al analyzed a Hong Kong Chinese cohort and found cataract is common in patients with type  et al identified multiple candidate genes that had significantly different expression levels in the type  diabetes patients with higher Lens Opacities Classification System (LOCS) score (i
However, the magnitude of the genetic association between type  diabetes and cataract remains unclear, as does the problem of whether their genetic association Traditional methods estimate the shared genetics by comparing the concordance between monozygotic and dizygotic twins, and establish causal conclusions using the randomized (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Shi et al extended LDSC and proposed heritability estimation from summary statistics (-HESS), a method to quantify the local single-trait heritability and cross-trait genetic correlation from approximately LD-independent genomic regions
In this study, we leveraged the large East Asian population-based GWAS summary statistics of type  diabetes and cataract from BioBank Japan Project (BBJ) to comprehensively investigate the shared genetics between the two diseases
Next, we applied SMR to the single-trait GWAS and the cross-trait meta-analysis GWAS of type  diabetes and cataract, and identified two candidate risk genes (Table ), MIRHG expression levels were negatively associated (i
, lower gene expression level increases the disease risk) with the susceptibility to co-morbid type  diabetes and cataract but not with the (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
These genes likely play crucial roles in the casual effects of type  diabetes on To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the genetic correlation and explore the potential causality between type  diabetes and cataract specifically using East Asian population-based GWAS summary statistics
