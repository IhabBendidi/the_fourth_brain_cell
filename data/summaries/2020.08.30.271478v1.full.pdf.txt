;    The article describes a quick protocol to gonadectomize and sample blood from small  teleost fish, using medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a model, to investigate the role of sex  Sex steroids, produced by the gonads, play an essential role in the neuroendocrine  control of reproduction in all vertebrates by providing feedback to the brain and pituitary
Here, we demonstrate the step-by-step procedure of gonadectomy in both males  and females followed by blood sampling in a small sized teleost model, the Japanese  medaka (Oryzias latipes)
The use of these procedures combined with the other  advantages of using these small teleost models will greatly improve our understanding of  feedback mechanisms in the neuroendocrine control of reproduction and tissue plasticity  In vertebrates, sex steroids, which are mainly produced by the gonads, play  important roles in the regulation of the Brain-Pituitary-Gonadal (BPG) axis through  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
In particular, small teleost models, such as zebrafish and medaka, are species with  very high fecundity and relatively short life cycle enabling rapid analysis of gene function  and disease mechanisms , thus providing even greater advantages in addressing a  developed protocols and genetic tools available for these species (reviewed in (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
;    In numerous studies, the removal of gonads (gonadectomy), the main source of  sex steroid production, has been used as a method for investigating many physiological  questions, including its impact in vertebrate reproductive physiology, including in  aimed for quantifying circulating hormone levels, including those of sex steroids Together, these two techniques have shown their importance in a great number of  studies, including the investigation of feedback mechanisms and the effect of sex steroids  easy to perform in bigger species, such as European sea bass , they raise challenges when applied in smaller fishes, such as zebrafish  and medaka
However, medaka has a smaller genome size than   and a genetic sex determination system allowing for investigation of  sexual differences before second sexual characters or gonads are well developed  This paper demonstrates gonadectomy and blood sampling in small teleost  models, a technique that takes only  minutes in total and that will complete the list of  detailed video protocols already existing for this species that included labeling of blood  
This technique will allow the research community to investigate and better  understand the roles of sex steroids in feedback mechanisms as well as brain and  All experimentations and animal handling were conducted in accordance with the  recommendations on the experimental animal welfare at Norwegian University of Life  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
 If performed correctly, no piece of gonad should remain after the gonadectomy  (Figure ), and after  months, all gonadectomized fish still showed healthy phenotype,  E and -KT blood concentrations measured with ELISA following the  manufacturers instructions revealed that E levels in OVX females (,  , ng/ml) are  significantly lower than in sham-operated females (,  , ng/ml)  hours after  surgery (Figure A)
However, partly orchidectomized males, where only / to / of the  gonad was removed, showed significantly higher levels of KT compared to in fully  As reported in previous literature, gonadectomy and blood sampling have long  been used in other model species to investigate questions related to the role of sex  steroids in regulation of the BPG axis
Considering the small size of the most used teleost models, we  hereby describe detailed protocols for gonadectomy and blood sampling that are feasible  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
