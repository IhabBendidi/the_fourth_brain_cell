aureus infections received AB-SA, a bacteriophage product prepared according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), as adjunctive therapy to antibiotics
Bacterial burden and inflammatory responses were reduced and no phage-resistant staphylococci were isolated during Meaning: Our results will inform future randomised controlled trials assessing the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory potential of bacteriophages in the treatment of severe S
aureus infection, including complicated bacteraemia, Objective: To assess safety and tolerability of adjunctive bacteriophage therapy in patients with patients admitted to a tertiary-referral hospital with S
aureus bacteraemia (including infective endocarditis, n=)  were assessed by the treating clinician and two consulting infectious diseases physicians to independently verify that routine medical and surgical therapy was optimal and that a poor outcome remained likely
