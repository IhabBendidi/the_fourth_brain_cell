 Here, we analysed the variation among drug response data of the NCI project,  which for decades has  tested anti-cancer agents in a -cell line panel following a  standardised protocol []
In a dispute about the consistency of two large pharmacogenomic screens in  cancer cell line panels, the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database and the  Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia [-], four analyses by different groups concluded  a reasonable level of consistency [-], while six studies, all by the same group,  To develop a realistic understanding of the replicability of standardised assays  in a world-leading research environment, we investigated the variation in drug  response data from the NCI screen []

For this analysis,  we used the  FDA-approved drugs that were tested at least  times in at least  one cell line over periods of  to  months (Figure A, Extended Data Table ),  resulting in , drug/cell line combinations and in total , experiments  For every set of experiments performed on the same date, we generated  , random control samples of the same size and compared the value distribution
When we  looked at the individual drugs, six displayed a majority of drug/cell line combinations  with higher mean same date GI fold changes higher than in the random samples  and twelve drugs displayed lower ones (Figure F, Extended Data Table )
