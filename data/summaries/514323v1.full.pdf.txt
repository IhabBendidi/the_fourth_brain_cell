 HTN treatment is associated with an approximately -% reduction in risk of incident  The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial  (ALLHAT) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial designed to  compare cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in high-risk antihypertensive patients assigned to the  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) lisinopril, the calcium channel blocker (CCB)  amlodipine, and the -blocker doxazosin, in comparison to a thiazide-type diuretic  (chlorthalidone)
This study aimed to quantify the extent to which the effect of lisinopril,  amlodipine, and doxazosin (as compared to chlorthalidone) on incident HF is mediated by  evolving LVH and BP lowering
We hypothesized that evolving ECG LVH and BP lowering are  mechanisms behind previously observed differences in the rate of incident HF in hypertensive  ALLHAT participants randomized to lisinopril, amlodipine, and doxazosin, in comparison to  For this study, we used the ALLHAT dataset, publicly available from the National Heart,  Lung, and Blood Institute, via BioLINCC

 The main finding of our study is that the evolving ECG-LVH and BP-lowering explain up to  % of the HF-preventive effect of diuretic chlorthalidone, as compared to the preventive effect  of antihypertensive treatment with the alpha-blocker doxazosin, the ACEi lisinopril, and the  CCB amlodipine
