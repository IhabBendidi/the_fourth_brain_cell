Predictive Modelling of The Dynamic Patterns of Thinking in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Diagnostic Accuracy of Spatiotemporal Fractal Measures[] Victoria University of Wellington, School of Mathematics, Statistics and Operations[] Victoria University of Wellington, School of Biological Sciences
Objectives: Using acustomized definition of EF and a new clinical paradigm, we performed a prospectivediagnostic accuracy trial to assess the diagnostic value of several fractal measures fromthe thinking processes or inferences in a cohort of ADHD children and typically devel-oping controls
ADHD is a major diagnostic challengefor clinicians; no useful bio-markers or gold standard diagnostic tests are avail-able to date (Scassellati et al, ; Thome et al, ; Rothenberger et al,The current diagnosis of ADHD is performed in a subjective manner bywithstanding, it has been estimated that around % of those diagnoses couldbe mistaken (Elder, ; Merten et al, ), and hence in recent decades alarge amount of translational research in medicine has been carried out tryingto devise an objective technology for ADHD diagnosis
Con-sequently, most of the practical methods for assessing EF for an ADHD diagnosisunder the cognitive paradigm rest on measures of performance or achievement(Goldstein and Naglieri, ; Griffin et al, ; Hoskyn et al, ) of theindividuals from different particular cognitive domains and are based in openloop tasks (Marken, , )
To the best of our knowledge no integrat-ive measures have been produced that could account for the mechanisms andthe regulatory aspect of EF across the different cognitive domains and using awas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
From atranslational point of view, these limitations has been hindering the conversionof basic knowledge into a clinical technology for the diagnosis and managementwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
The core of this proposal rests in a newThe guiding hypotheses contended here is that the dynamic patterns of think-ing or inferences of children with ADHD elicited by a solving problem task(computer version of a popular board game known as Battleship) are differentwhen compared with their typically developing controls and that there are spa-between individuals with ADHD from those without it
