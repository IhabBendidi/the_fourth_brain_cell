 months), in addition to decreased acute grade + gastrointestinal toxicity (% vs %) even at higher doses (BED>Gy) with  Given these initial retrospective data, we initiated a phase I/II adaptive dose escalation trial using image guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for LAPC maximum tolerated dose using SBRT
In preparation for the activation of this protocol, we undertook a dosimetric feasibility study to determine a) whether all patients treated with IMRT could have also been planned with SBRT and b) the maximum feasible delivered biological effective dose (BED) using SBRT while maintaining standard organ at risk (OAR) constraints to gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa with daily imaging, motion certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
