Surprisingly, until week  the low-dose outperformed the high-dose group and reached significantly improved strength compared to placebo, mirrored by an increase in muscle volume
Signs of late-onset immune reactivity after high-dose treatment corresponded to reduced Conclusion: Allogeneic PLX-PAD therapy improved strength and volume of injured skeletal muscle with a reasonable safety profile
Patient Our primary finding was a highly significant improvement in maximal isometric contraction force in the treated abductor muscles of the low-dose group compared with the placebo group after  weeks (P=
The corresponding volume changes reflected the pattern in the force measurements of all groups, with inferior findings of We also analyzed whether changes in function and macrostructure were reflected on the microstructural level based on our analyses of GM needle biopsies but no significant differences not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
i) Do PLX-PAD cells further amplify the known postoperative immune-depression related to Importantly, treatment did not amplify either the post-surgical immune-depression observed in the placebo group (illustrated by the strongly reduced monocytic HLA-DR expression; Figure A) or postoperative systemic inflammation (as in IL- [Figure B] or CrP plasma levels)
ii) Can the clear dose-dependent differences in efficacy and its kinetics be related to a Remarkably, alterations of immune cell subsets displaying the immediate postoperative stress were significantly reduced by PLX-PAD therapy, specifically in the low-dose group
We also observed a reduced drop in the frequency of naive CD+ T-cells and T-regulatory cell subset and reduced  out of the  high-dose patients exhibited a significant increase in their TNF plasma levels The histological analysis showed an equal distribution of lymphocytes and macrophages in the muscle biopsies between the groups
The primary finding of our study was an improvement in muscle strength mirrored by an increase in muscle volume in the cell-therapy groups compared with the placebo group and an inferiority of the high-dose group versus the low-dose group
() Although cells were not labeled in our patients to avoid possible alterations of their biologic potential, preclinical studies had shown that transplanted PLX-PAD cells had been cleared from the host muscle within a few weeks, which highlights the Procedural pain and soft tissue swelling are typical postoperative side effects of hip arthroplasty
Another weakness is the light sex bias with a skewed distribution between the groups, but even taking into account this bias as confounder, the support of muscle regeneration by PLX cells remains In an injury, which does not comprise the whole muscle, such as the direct lateral approach used as a model in this study, the prize for the high standardization level is the compensation of contraction force within  weeks (first time of measurement)
Patients treated with  million PLX-PAD showed an increase of contraction force and volumes of gluteus medius muscles compared to the placebo group
Since we were analyzing a region that has been treated and was located directly proximal to the injury zone, we would have expected to observe an immune cell infiltration related to the treatment in this area, but, of course, an infiltration in another muscle region not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Preoperative baselines values of non-injured contralateral side (B) Placebo: not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
We evaluated the mean myofiber diameter (A) on muscle biopsies obtained preoperatively and  weeks after PLX-PAD or placebo treatment
