The reasons for this are unclear, but may be due to impaired replicative fitness of pHN Methods: In an open-label, prospective, observational, phase  study, we evaluated the impact of updating the pHN component in the Russian-backbone trivalent LAIV from Cal in - (n=) to an A/Michigan//-like strain (A//New York//, NY) in - (n=), on shedding and immunogenicity in Gambian children aged - years old
The study Findings: Cal showed impaired nasopharyngeal shedding compared to HN and influenza B, along with sub-optimal serum antibody and T-cell responses
Following the switch to NY, a significant increase in pHN shedding was seen, along with improvements in seroconversion and influenza-specific CD+ T-cell responses
Potential reasons include pre-existing immunity, poor viral replicative fitness or competition from other co-formulated strains, all limiting pHN take and The findings in Senegal are particularly pertinent as the burden of influenza in Africa is high, with influenza-related hospitalisations in children < years approximately three-fold higher than in Europe
 In particular, the absence of immunological endpoints from the RCT in Senegal make it difficult To better understand how differences in strain shedding and immunogenicity may explain these findings, we immunised one cohort of influenza vaccine-nave Gambian children with the Russian-backbone LAIV - formulation, followed by a second cohort with the - formulation of the same vaccine
RT-PCR assays with primers and probes mapping to internal genes were used to distinguish LAIV from seasonal influenza viruses was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
;    The primary shedding and immunogenicity outcomes were the percentage of children with LAIV strain shedding at D and D, HAI seroconversion and increase in influenza HA-specific IgA Differences in proportions between years were examined using Chi-squared or Fishers exact test and continuous variables between years using the unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney U test
Logistic regression also showed no associations between shedding and pre-vaccination T-cell response or HA-specific mucosal IgA for Cal (table S)
Ct value comparisons between - and - LAIV strains in seronegative children revealed the only significant difference as being a lower D ct (higher viral load) of NY compared to Monovalent vaccine strain replication was tested in primary hNECs cultured at airliquid interface, to see whether in vitro kinetics (in the absence of adaptive immune responses) reflected Cal and NY shedding in children

Similar findings were observed in B/Vic and NY pHN datasets, albeit with We demonstrate limited shedding,  in vitro Cal replication, and low immunogenicity following the - LAIV in Gambian children, providing an explanation for the lack of efficacy observed in the RCT from neighbouring Senegal Following the switch to NY, a significant increase in replication was observed, along with improved serum humoral and cellular immunogenicity
