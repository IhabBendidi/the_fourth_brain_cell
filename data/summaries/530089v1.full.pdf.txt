This study investigated effects of rice bran  supplementation on growth, EED biomarkers, gut microbiome and metabolome in weaning  infants from  to  months old in Nicaragua and Mali
Daily consumption of rice bran was safe and feasible for infant growth, decreasing  alpha- antitrypsin levels, and modulating gut microbiome and metabolome when  compared to control
The effect of rice bran supplementation on host resistance to enteric  infections and enhanced gut mucosal immunity was demonstrated for Salmonella enterica  certified by peer review) is the author/funder
The nutritional composition and metabolic profile of rice bran, which  comprises a large suite of bioactive molecules, showed benefits in animal studies that  provided important rationale for investigation of dietary feasibility in weaning infants and  The major objective of this study was to investigate effects of dietary rice bran  supplementation during infant weaning on growth, EED biomarkers, gut microbiome and  metabolome from six to twelve months of age in Nicaragua and Mali
The feasibility and tolerability for infants to consume rice bran at increasing doses (- g/day) over the six month study period was demonstrated when mothers fed rice bran  certified by peer review) is the author/funder
 Rice bran modulates gut microbial communities in Nicaraguan and Malian infants  The microbiome was characterized and compared for  Malian and  Nicaraguan  infants at  and  months of age in the rice bran and control study groups
 Given the measurable differences in growth between groups by  months of age, the effect  of daily dietary supplementation of rice bran on the infant microbiome was compared to the  In Nicaragua, we identified  OTUs that were significantly different between  control and rice bran across the samples (Table S),  of which showed greater than or  equal to  log fold differences between rice bran and control groups at  or  months (Fig
For Nicaraguan infants (Table  S), the notable rice bran responsive taxa which increased at  months of age compared to  Veillonella (different OTUs, log-FC >

;    There were  OTUs identified as rice bran responsive from this microbial  community analysis that showed changes in both Mali and Nicaragua at either  or   months of age when compared to control
The highest area of overlap occurred for both  taxa that overlapped between countries with respect to rice bran intake included three  Metabolomics identified rice bran and microbial digested rice bran small molecules in  A total of  stool samples were collected from this -month prospective study to  evaluate effects of rice bran supplementation compared to control infants from Nicaragua  and Mali
 Table  lists the fold differences calculated from the relative abundances of each stool  metabolite between study diet groups at  months of age, whereby infants had been  consuming rice bran daily for  months
There are  (Nicaragua) and  (Mali) stool  metabolites with significant fold differences between children consuming rice bran  compared to control
Rice bran supplementation in the diet supported growth of Nicaraguan and  Malian infants with differences detected between groups by  months of age and improved  gut permeability at  months
EED biomarkers merit continuous  review for relevance with growth outcomes due to extensive global variability in  A study limitation and possible confounder of rice bran modulation to infant gut  measures was that the percentage of exclusively breastfed infants was lower and delivery  certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Thus, we did expect  changes in both the stool microbiome and metabolome that occurred over time with growth,  and notably the microbial taxa and metabolites associated with the improved growth in rice  bran groups also differed at  months in both countries
 Given that dietary rice bran intake has been previously shown to promote beneficial  stool microbial communities, such as native gut probiotics in mice ,, pigs ,, and  adults ,,, we first evaluated significant genus level taxa differences between rice bran  and control fed infants at  months and  months of age from both countries
In Mali, the  increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus in rice bran fed infants is also highly  consistent with prior studies in young animals, and should be considered alongside  evidence that human milk oligosaccharides also promote Lactobacillus in breastfed infants  certified by peer review) is the author/funder
As predicted, we  observed and reported exceptionally distinct profiles for both the stool microbiome and  metabolome composition of infants between Mali and Nicaragua at all ages ,, and  therefore separately discussed the response to rice bran supplementation by region
These plots were generated  for the data at the genus and the family levels and meant to describe the microbial  community structure per sampled infant and per time point under each of the treatment  certified by peer review) is the author/funder
