We conclude that many LVO patients have a stroke physiology that is favorable for late intervention, and that there are biomarkers that can accurately identify them at early time not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
We analyzed our cohort of LVO patients who underwent frequent MR imaging over  days to identify biomarkers on the admission scan that accurately identify patients likely to have  Our aim was to identify patient biomarkers measured at first hospital arrival that would predict that the infarct core at  hours after stroke onset would be no larger than ml
The ischemic core target volume of ml was based on the data from the prospective thrombectomy clinical trials that used core volumes of less ml , as inclusion criteria, as well as the observation from the HERMES collaboration that revealed that patients with final infarcts of <ml after thrombectomy had an ~% probability of living independently at  months even when they not certified by peer review) is the author/funder

This conservative core target of ml was based on the data from the prospective clinical trials that used core volumes of less than ml , as inclusion criteria, as well as the observation from the HERMES collaboration that patients with final infarcts of <ml after thrombectomy had an ~% probability of living independently at  months Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to find the best biomarkers of treatable slow progressors in the  patients with ICA and M occlusions
ROC Analyses of Baseline Variables To Predict Ischemic Core of  Patients with potentially severe strokes caused by an occlusion of a major cerebral artery but with a favorable physiology have small infarct cores that grow slowly and are likely to be excellent candidates for thrombectomy despite significant time delays
