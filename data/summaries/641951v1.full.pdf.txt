Gaebler et al describe a combined multicolor qPCR and next generation sequencing method that enables the sensitive and specific HIV- infection requires life-long therapy with anti-retroviral drugs due to the existence of a latent reservoir of transcriptionally inactive integrated proviruses
Four different qPCR probes covering the packaging signal (PS), group-specific antigen (gag), polymerase (pol), and envelope (env) are combined in a single multiplex reaction to detect the HIV- genome in limiting dilution samples followed by sequence verification of individual reactions that are positive for combinations of any  of the  probes (QPCR)
Thus, treatment interruption leads almost invariably to rapid viral rebound and therapy with cART is required for the lifetime of the infected individual An important goal for HIV- research is to achieve a functional remission or cure by decreasing or eliminating the latent reservoir, and a number of clinical trials have been designed to test new approaches to this problem (Caskey et al, ; Cillo and Mellors, ; Gruell and Klein, ; Margolis et al, )
Here we report a relatively high throughput method for enumerating and characterizing intact latent proviral DNA by a combination of multicolor quantitative PCR (QPCR) and next certified by peer review) is the author/funder
We compare the new method to quantitative and qualitative viral outgrowth assays (QVOA) and near full-length (NFL) sequencing on paired peripheral blood samples obtained at  time points from the same  individuals enrolled in a clinical trial that involved analytical treatment interruption (ATI) after infusion of a combination of two broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Lu et al, ; Mendoza et al, )
To select primer/probe sets that maximize detection of HIV- we analyzed four previously characterized candidates in silico using intact proviral genomes from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database (Bruner and Siliciano, ; Bruner et al, ; Palmer et al, ; Schmid et al, )
The selected primer/probes cover conserved regions in the HIV- genome including the packaging signal (PS), group-specific antigen (gag), polymerase (pol), and envelope (env) (Fig
To test whether these primer/probe sets can discriminate between intact and defective proviruses we also performed the same in silico analysis on  intact and defective HIV- sequences from certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Thus, the in silico data suggest that any single combination of  probes would not be sufficient for sensitive and specific reservoir measurements due to HIV- sequence To accommodate HIV- sequence diversity we developed a multiplex qPCR strategy for simultaneous detection of  probes, PS, gag, pol, and env using a -well format (QPCR)
To determine overall HIV- proviral frequency, genomic DNA from CD+ T cells was assayed for gag by qPCR
-fold lower) to the number predicted from short segment gag qPCR performed before the amplification indicating that near full-length genome PCR There was substantial variation between individuals (see below), but the median frequency of proviruses reactive to  or more probes was  X - CD+ T cells or approximately x less than gag DNA alone
Preliminary sequence analysis indicated that samples reacting with only a single primer/probe or only the PS+gag combination were defective, and these samples certified by peer review) is the author/funder
In line with our previous observations from both QVOA and NFL sequencing, the new QPCR sequencing strategy was unable to detect a sequence match between intact proviral sequences and rebound viruses obtained by single genome analysis (SGA) at the To determine how integrated HIV- varied between individuals and time points within an individual we analyzed both defective and intact proviruses (Fig
Overall % of PS+env positive samples are associated with defective proviral sequences, and  of the  individuals failed to show any signal with the PS primer/probe set (Fig
Only the combination of any two QPCR primer/probe sets and next generation sequencing is both sensitive Accurate measurement of the size of the circulating latent reservoir is essential for evaluating therapeutic interventions that aim to eliminate it (Sengupta and Siliciano, )
In addition, these assays selectively underestimate the reservoir because only a fraction of latently infected cells can be induced after a single round of stimulation in vitro (Ho et al, ; Hosmane Sequencing near full-length proviral genomes from limiting dilution CD+ T cell DNA samples allows relatively unbiased characterization of the proviral reservoir (Hiener et al, ; Ho et al, ; Lu et al, )
;    In conclusion the combination of  probe qPCR and next generation sequencing is a highly sensitive and specific method for measuring intact proviruses in the HIV- latent reservoir
Based on predicted binding and favorable physical properties for multiplex qPCR reactions we selected the packaging signal (PS) (Bruner and Siliciano, ), group-specific antigen (gag) (Palmer et al, ), polymerase (pol) (Schmid et al, ), and envelope (env) (Bruner et al, ) primer/probe sets
