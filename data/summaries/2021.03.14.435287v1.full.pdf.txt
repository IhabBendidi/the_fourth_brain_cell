;    Targeting reactive oxygen species (ROS) while maintaining cellular redox signaling is crucial in the development of redox medicine for the therapeutic benefit as the origin of several prevailing diseases including chronic kidney disease (CKD) is linked to ROS imbalance and associated mitochondrial dysfunction
A detailed study involving human embryonic kidney (HEK ) cells and isolated mitochondria from action of the nanomedicine involves protection of structural and functional integrity of mitochondria from oxidative damage, the subsequent reduction in intracellular ROS, and maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis
Excessive generation of ROS may lead to is linked to inflammation, aging, and pathogenesis of diseases like diabetes, cancer, understanding about the pivotal role of ROS as secondary messengers in cellular signaling to control processes like metabolism, energetics, cell survival, and death lead to a paradigm shift to the traditional oxidants are bad  antioxidants are good based simplistic view of redox biology [-]
In this regard, biocompatible transition metal oxide nanoparticles with potential electron-donating as well as accepting capability could be a viable option provided they are stable in the biological system, able to assimilate in the targeted tissue, Recently, we have shown that spinel structured citrate functionalized MnO nanoparticles (C-MnO NPs) have the unique ability to generate ROS in dark, and when injected into jaundiced animals can selectively degrade bilirubin (a toxic byproduct of heme metabolism) without showing adverse effects to other blood parameters []
The mechanistic details of their pharmacological action in the maintenance of redox homeostasis and mitoprotection were further explored using cellular (human embryonic kidney cell, HEK ) as well as the (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Pretreatment with C-MnO NPs protected the cells from HO induced oxidative damage resulting in a ~% reduction in the LDH release (p<
To evaluate the scavenging of HO by C-MnO NPs under stress condition, we monitored the intracellular oxidative stress using a ROS-DCFDA-H is transported across the cell membrane and hydrolyzed by intracellular converted to highly fluorescent ,-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) in the presence of reactive oxygen species
The cells pretreated with C-MnO NPs prevented the shrinkage and congregation of the cell body due to HO Mitochondria despite being the primary source of intracellular ROS and its control is the most susceptible organelle to oxidative damage leading to redox imbalance and cell death [, ]
In cells treated with C-MnO NPs alone, none of the detrimental effects were (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
;    Thus, our cellular studies indicate that C-MnO NPs possess the distinctive property of enzymes and maintaining high cell viability by acting as a protector of mitochondria, the master regulator of cellular redox equilibrium (Figure l schematically summarizes the There is always a gap in the efficacies of a pharmacological agent tested between cellular metabolism often restricts the use of a cytoprotective agent in vivo [-]
Thus, we evaluated the potential of C-MnO NPs in the treatment of cisplatin-induced CBL/j mice, a well-known animal model for testing therapeutic interventions against CKD [-]
;    In this study, we determined whether C-MnO NPs could be used as a redox medicine to treat CKD, an important clinical question considering the high prevalence of the disease and the non-availability of effective medication
Our results present evidence that treatment with C-MnO NPs significantly improved renal mitochondrial dysfunction in response to the cisplatin toxicity
Our findings that C-MnO NPs maintain cellular redox homeostasis through the prevention of mPTP opening and ATP depletion discloses a key redox-mediated therefore vulnerable to the oxidative distress due to mitochondrial damage [, ]
Cisplatin accrues in mitochondria and reduces the activity of all four respiratory complexes (IV) involved in the electron transport chain, thereby a surge in mitochondrial ROS formation takes place along with mPTP opening, membrane depolarization and impairment in ATP production, leading to cell death [, ]
Data from our cellular as well as animal studies provide sufficient evidence that C-MnO NPs prevent mitochondrial ROS surge, prevent loss of membrane potential, dysfunction, cellular redox imbalance, and tubular or glomerular cell death
, ROS scavenging and mitochondrial protection) The findings that C-MnO NPs can accelerate the revival of proximal tubule epithelium proliferation of a subset of sublethally damaged, yet surviving, proximal tubule cells contribute to the regenerative property of the kidney []
Additionally, ROS scavenging by C-MnO NPs may boost the proliferation because oxidative distress in proximal tubules causes cell cycle The role of intracellular redox regulation through mitoprotection in the therapeutic action of C-MnO NPs opens up further avenues for the treatment of several unmet diseases like multiple sclerosis), cardiovascular disorders, obesity, etc
