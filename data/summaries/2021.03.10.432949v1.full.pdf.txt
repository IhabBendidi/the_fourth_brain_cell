Herein, we demonstrate apabetalone, the most clinical advanced BET inhibitor, downregulates expression of cell surface receptors involved in SARS-CoV- entry, including angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE) and dipeptidyl-peptidase  (DPP or CD) in SARS-CoV- permissive cells
We show that apabetalone downregulates ACE gene expression, protein levels and cellular binding of SARS-CoV- spike protein in cell culture models, and strikingly reduces infection with live SARS-CoV-
Together, our data show that BET proteins are key pharmacological targets for COVID- treatment and further investigation of apabetalone as a therapeutic to treat SARS-CoV- infection is warranted
Cell surface ACE protein levels were measured on a BD FACSCelesta (BD Biosciences) and (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
;    Post BETi treatment, cells were detached with Accutase (Thermo Fisher), washed, and incubated with recombinant SARS-CoV- Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) fused to the human IgG Fc domain (R&D Systems -CV-) or control recombinant human IgG Fc protein (R&D Systems -CV-) for  min at room temperature
Therefore, we investigated the effect of apabetalone on ACE gene expression in SARS-CoV- permissible cell lines including human lung epithelial cells; Calu-, and monkey kidney epithelial cells; Vero E
Thus, BETi treatment lowered the abundance of ACE in both lung and kidney cells, with potential to impede SARS-CoV- infection or replication, as cells that do not express (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
In this study, we report apabetalone, the most clinically advanced BETi with BD selectivity, reduces SARS-CoV- infection in cell culture models through downregulation of viral uptake receptors
In this study, apabetalone treatment resulted in robust and dose dependent downregulation of ACE gene expression in Calu- lung epithelial cells (Fig
Lower levels of cell surface ACE were in parallel with diminished binding of SARS-CoV- spike protein to cells treated with BETi compounds, including BD selective apabetalone, pan-BETi JQ and a BET degrader MZ (Fig
