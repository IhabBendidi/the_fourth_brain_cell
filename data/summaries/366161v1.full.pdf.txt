Neurodegeneration is thought to be a major driver of MS-related impairments in higher order brain functions such as cognition,  highlighting the importance of developing treatment options in this area (Amato et Exercise training has received increasing attention as a putative strategy to target the degenerative component of multiple sclerosis (Motl et al )
;    cognitive performance seems to be a suitable endpoint to determine neuroprotective effects of However, while numerous studies now have shown beneficial effects of exercise training on physical capacity, strength, quality of life, mood (Latimer-Cheung et al ) and fatigue in MS (Heine et al ), high quality clinical trials focusing on cognitive function are scarce and the evidence not conclusive (Sandroff et al )
To our knowledge no study yet has addressed In the current study, we aimed to determine the effects of individually tailored aerobic exercise on verbal learning and memory as the primary endpoint in patients with relapsing-remitting Our trial was a single-blind, : randomized, controlled phase IIa study with an active intervention (IG) and a waitlist control group (CG)
During the extension phase, patients originally randomized to the waitlist group had the opportunity to train as well and intervention group patients were invited to The primary endpoint of our study was the Verbal Learning and Memory Test (VLMT) (Lux et al )
Tertiary endpoints were walking ability and motor function (for details see below) as well as patient reported outcomes not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
