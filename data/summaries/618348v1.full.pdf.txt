The clinical study data indicated that the Callascope enabled similar visualization compared to the speculum while significantly improving patient experience
The Callascope can be used by medical providers for clinical exams while also enabling home self-screening for cervical cancer and promoting a better understanding of ones cervix to increase awareness of cervical screening needs

Image capture with a low-cost, easy-to-use, self-imaging device, which can enable diagnostic reading by a remote health provider would allow women to visualize their cervices and receive expert feedback, without the need for a hospital visit
This manuscript builds upon our previous work and reports on three distinct avenues of inquiry that directly serve to address the barriers described in the introduction: () a pilot clinical study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Callascope for examination of the cervices of patients undergoing cervical cancer screening, () healthy volunteer studies where women performed a home-based self-exam after completion of a short training session in a clinical setting to demonstrate the feasibility of self-imaging in the absence of a health professional, and finally () pre- and post-surveys as well as audio reflections (in the self-imaging group only) to collect perceptions of the speculum, cervical cancer screening, and experiences with the Callascope
The self-exam investigation differed from our previous healthy volunteer study in that women imaged their cervices independently, without a physician or health provider present and further used the device several times in their homes over a period of one week
This paper presents two sub-studies, each with a distinct group of participants: () a physician-administered exam with the Callascope on patients undergoing a routine Pap smear; and () self-imaging of the cervix with the Callascope over a period of one week at home after initial training in a clinical setting
After the procedure, the participant was asked to fill out a post-exam survey which assessed comfort, quantified on a - Wong-The self-exam study involved training healthy volunteers to use the Callascope and usage of the device over a one-week period to assess ease-of-use and feasibility of imaging the cervix without physician guidance
Based on appearance only, more women from the self-exam and clinical study groups were willing to use the Callascope over the speculum
Overall, the Callascope allows women-centered cervix imaging to reduce barriers to cervical cancer screening, primarily by removing the speculum and associated pain from initial screening, enabling self-screening and providing a tool for women to educate themselves on their reproductive anatomy
