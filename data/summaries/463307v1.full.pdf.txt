Their  relative abundance was explored through S amplicon sequencing via Illumina MiSeq (separate runs  for VV and V variable regions) of facial skin samples (cheek) of  volunteers ( male and   female), who did not display acne-related symptoms

Lactobacillus taxa  can thus be considered as endogenous members of the skin microbiota, although their relative  abundance is lower than Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Cutibacterium (often still classified as  Propionibacterium), and Streptococcus, which were the most the dominant taxa in our dataset for  To confirm our in-house generated data and investigate whether our results are facial site-specific,  the presence of lactobacilli was also substantiated in publicly available skin metagenome shotgun  datasets by using the curatedMetagenomicData R-package recently described by Pasolli et al (/) showed the presence of at least one Lactobacillus species (Figure a), but only  samples  showed a relative abundance higher than %
The relative abundance of Lactobacillus sequences in the skin samples was also  compared to the publicly available data of other human body sites (both S and curated  metagenome) (Figure b)

Lactobacillus strains were selected from our in-house available  laboratory collection (Extended Data Table ) for tailored application in patients with mild-to  moderate acne symptoms
A thorough screening approach was applied based on the rationalization  that the strains had to be safe, applicable (being robust and showing niche-flexibility as described for  ) and have the capacity to exert the desired beneficial functions on the  human skin including microbiome modulation, immune modulation and epithelial barrier  enhancement (Figure a)
Furthermore, we validated that the three selected lactobacilli did not exhibit  toxic or overt inflammatory responses on primary skin cells (Figure e), in agreement with genome   and laboratory validation of antibiotic resistance profiles according to the guidelines  Viable Lactobacillus formulation in O/W cream
No significant difference in relative abundance of Lactobacillus taxa was  observed between our patients and the reference samples at time of inclusion (Extended Data  Figure a-b)
After application of the cream with the lactic-acid producing  lactobacilli, the facial skin samples of our acne patients at visit  and visit  clearly clustered  separately on a PCoA plot (Figure c)
 Twice daily topical application of this cream with the live lactobacilli was able to reduce inflammatory  acne lesions and comedone formation in the ten patients included in the open-label pilot study, and  was associated with a reduction in Staphylococcus relative abundance (as summarized in Figure )
Together, these studies  will contribute to a new era of skin therapeutics based on microbiome modulation, as well as more  fundamental and mechanistic insights on the keystone core functions of lactic acid bacteria for skin  not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
