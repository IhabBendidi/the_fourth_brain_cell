Planned primary analyses used linear mixed effects regression to model baseline to post-intervention changes in the Motor Activity Log-Quality of Movement rating (MALQ) and the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) time score as a function of therapy dosage
Conclusions: For mild-to-moderately impaired stroke survivors, the dosage of a patient-centered, task specific motor therapy was shown to systematically influence the gain in quality of arm use in the natural environment, but not functional capacity as measured in the laboratory
, active control, low, moderate, high), and a patient-centered behavioral intervention that was especially designed to enhance arm The primary aim is to test the dosage of task-specific practice that is needed to achieve meaningful recovery of the arm and hand in chronic stroke survivors
Trained and standardized For planned primary analyses, we used linear mixed effects regression (LMEs) to model changes in MALQ and WMFT during treatment as a function of dosage group (, , , and  hours), similar to Lang and colleagues

Our primary outcome findings demonstrate that the higher the dosage of ASAP, the greater the change in Motor Activity Log-Quality of Movement over three spaced training bouts, (~ months) in chronic stroke survivors
Dosage modified the participation-level outcome, a measure of arm and hand use, but not the activity-level outcome, a measure of functional The recent phase II RCT sought to determine the dose-response of task specific arm/hand training in people at least  months after stroke
