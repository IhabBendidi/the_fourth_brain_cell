This may explain why there was no difference observed in PNP, the measured marker of collagen type- synthesis, between IPF subjects and health controls and why differences were not seen between stable and progressive disease
This panel of biomarkers provides informative insights into matrix turnover and prognostic value of change in these biomarkers is discernible within  months, providing much needed short-term measurements to assist the identification of at-risk IPF patients, which could be used to supplement physiological assessment to not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
