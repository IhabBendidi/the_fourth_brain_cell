In this study we investigated the cellular and metabolic effects of modulating the balance between G protein activation and -arrestin- recruitment at GLP-R and GCGR using oxyntomodulin (OXM)-derived co-agonists
Both GLP-R and GCGR are primarily coupled to cAMP generation through Gs activation, with recruitment of -arrestins being associated with receptor desensitisation, endocytosis and diminished long term functional responses [,]
By comparing the metabolic effects of a pair of matched peptides with these sequence substitutions, we demonstrate that reduced recruitment efficacy of -arrestins translates to improved efficacy in preclinical rodent models of obesity, consistent with a similar effect previously observed for GLP-R mono-agonists [-]
Our study therefore suggests a viable strategy to optimise GLP-R/GCGR co-agonism for (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
The agonist efficacy term k was derived from these data as described [] for each agonist and, after log transform, the SRBQ response was expressed relative to SRBH as the (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
However, quantification of bias using the log(max/EC) scale [] indicated that this selective efficacy reduction does not qualify GLP--AIB as a biased agonist, as it was compensated by a corresponding small increase in potency (Figure B, C)
The Q/H switch at position  thereby provides a means to modulate efficacy whilst We performed molecular dynamics simulations of the active state GCGR in complex with glucagon, GCG-AIB, or GCG-AIBH to retrieve insights into the effects that peptide mutations have on the interactions, fingerprints and receptor flexibility
However, bias estimates from the kinetic responses (log k method) suggested a subtle preference for SRBQ at GLP-R towards mini-Gs recruitment cAMP signalling responses were also assessed in CHO-K cell lines expressing GLP-R, GCGR or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) (Figure E, Table )
Both ligands induced pronounced GLP-R internalisation, with a minor reduction in efficacy with SRBQ, but GCGR barely internalised with either ligand (Figure F); higher resolution images of SNAP-GLP-R or SNAP-GCGR-expressing cells labelled prior to agonist treatment corroborated these findings (DERET) [], kinetics of GLP-R internalisation were considerably slower for SRBQ than for (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Reductions in -arrestin- recruitment efficacy are associated with prolongation of cAMP signalling at GLP-R [,] and GCGR [], thought to result from avoidance of target receptor desensitisation
Overall, these studies indicate a general tendency for SRBQ responses to be relatively enhanced with longer stimulations, which is compatible with (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
 Anti-hyperglycaemic responses are prolonged after a single dose of SRBQ versus As GLP-R agonists with reduced -arrestin- recruitment efficacy and/or delayed endocytosis [,,], we aimed to establish if this therapeutic principle could also be applied to GLP-tolerance test (IPGTT) in lean mice tended to be lower after a single administration of SRBQ compared to SRBH, with this difference enhanced by longer agonist exposure time (Figure A)
Circulating concentrations of each ligand were the same  hours after a single dose, suggesting pharmacodynamic differences are unlikely to be due to altered Both GLP-R and GCGR agonism potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion [], but can also measured  min into a -hour-delayed IPGTT were higher with SRBQ than SRBH treatment, suggesting the formers improved anti-hyperglycaemic efficacy is likely to derive at least partly from action on beta cells (Figure C), in keeping with the trend we observed in pancreatic islets towards improved responsiveness after prolonged stimulation with SRBQ
These observations support our in vivo findings that the improved anti-hyperglycaemic performance of SRBQ becomes more apparent at later time-points after dosing, as was previously seen with GLP-R mono-agonists with analogous signalling This study was originally designed to assess the potential for biased agonism to improve therapeutic targeting of GLP-R and GCGR

;    al [], which includes the N-terminal sequence H-AIB-Q, does indeed show reductions in -arrestin recruitment efficacy to GLP-R (modest) and GCGR (substantial) compared to the endogenous agonist, without major loss in potency, broadly matching our observations with native ligand analogues and SRB peptides
Importantly, our study also provides structural insights into the importance of position  of glucagon peptide analogues, with molecular dynamics simulations indicating that the reduced -arrestin- recruitment associated with The most striking results in our study were observed from in vivo comparisons of SRBQ and SRBH
These findings are reminiscent of observations with exendin-phe, a GLP-R mono-agonist with marked reductions in -arrestin recruitment efficacy, which displayed better anti-hyperglycaemic effects and increased insulin secretion compared to exendin- in mice, with these differences being most obvious at later time-points []
However, one of the challenges with our study is identifying whether the observed effects result from enhanced action primarily at GLP-R or at GCGR, as SRBQ displayed reduced -arrestin- recruitment efficacy at both receptors, meaning that longer lasting signalling through avoidance of target desensitisation could apply in both cases
Notably, somewhat greater weight loss without a corresponding reduction in food intake for SRBQ was observed, which could conceivably result from increases in sustained GCGR activation, as might be predicted from the reduced -arrestin- recruitment efficacy of this peptide compared to SRBH
Nevertheless, the observation that both SRB peptides achieve similar weight loss to liraglutide despite a less potent anorectic effect adds to the evidence that GLP-R/GCGR co-agonism may be an effective means to treat obesity, potentially with reduced anorexia-associated nausea (although this was not (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
