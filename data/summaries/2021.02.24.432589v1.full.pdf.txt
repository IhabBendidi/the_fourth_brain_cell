We employ variants of the peptides GLP- and exendin- to explore the interplay between helical propensity near the agonist N-terminus and the ability to bind to and activate the receptor
Cryo-EM analysis of a complex involving an exendin- analogue, the GLP-R and Gs protein revealed two receptor conformers with distinct modes of peptide-receptor engagement
Our functional and structural data suggest that receptor conformational dynamics associated with flexibility of the peptide N-terminal activation domain may be a key determinant (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
, The primary endogenous GLP-R agonist is the fully processed peptide, GLP-  Class B receptors feature a large extracellular domain (ECD) in addition to the between the C-terminal portion of the peptide and the ECD; the N-terminal portion of the agonist subsequently engages the TMD core, facilitating conformational changes that are registered by the G protein and other intracellular partners (Fig
For CT, maxadilan, and CGRP, a disulfide linkage precludes helix propagation to the N-terminus, while for UCN and CRF the presence of proline residues near the N-terminus  The current work is predicated on previous suggestions that GLP- activity depends on adoption of a reverse turn near the peptide N-terminus, which raises the possibility that the N-terminal helical conformation in the cryo-EM structure of receptor-bound GLP- may not fully capture  structural requirements for signaling
Evidence for an N-terminal reverse turn in GLP-R agonists has emerged from NMR characterization of isolated peptides, and modeling of peptide-receptor conserved helix-capping motif near the agonist N-terminus that would favor non-helical (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
 Studies with peptide and protein model systems indicate that replacing Gly with L-Ala stabilizes a right-handed -helical conformation by up to  kcal/mol, while replacing Gly with D-Ala (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
These data support the conclusion that an ability to access non-helical conformations near the  GLP-R agonist analogues with turn-promoting -amino acids are more active than those with helix-promoting -amino acids at the fourth position
The patterns of relative activity among ACPC-containing analogues of GLP- and exendin- support the hypothesis that access to non-helical conformations near the agonist N-terminus is important for GLP-R  Peptides with helix-promoting  residues at the fourth position show relatively high affinity among the modified analogues
The relatively high affinity displayed by the Gly(S,S)-ACPC derivative of exendin- for the GLP-R suggests that stable receptor-ligand complexes occur when helical secondary structure extends to the ligand N-terminus, consistent with the consensus conformation of GLP-R peptide agonists in recent crystal and cryo-EM structures
To investigate the receptor-bound conformation of the potent exendin- analogue containing D-Ala in place of Gly (referred to below as Ex-D-Ala), we undertook cryo-EM studies of the complex formed by this agonist with the GLP-R
 Even though Ex-D-Ala shares the same C-terminal residues as the G protein-biased agonist exendin P (ExP),, Ex-D-Ala adopted a distinct position relative to the receptor from that displayed by ExP (Fig
Nonetheless, the observation that the D-Ala variant binds with ~-fold lower affinity to the GLP-R relative to exendin- itself suggests that agonist activity is not determined solely We hypothesize that conformer  is required for G protein activation, and that adoption of this receptor conformation is favored under conditions used to form a stable complex that can be imaged (inclusion of dominant negative G protein and nanobody , apyrase treatment)
 Similarly, we observed that Ex-D-Ala induced a lower maximal BRET signal relative to GLP- in a comparable assay The stability of a partially engaged state, the stability of the fully bound state (which is competent for G protein activation) and the height of the energy barrier separating these two states could all be affected by changes at Gly of GLP- or Gly of exendin- (Fig
In this case, the diminished affinities of the D-Ala analogues relative to the natural agonists could be compensated by an increase in average number of G proteins activated to cause the observed similarity in receptor activation efficacies of the D-Ala analogues relative to GLP- (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
