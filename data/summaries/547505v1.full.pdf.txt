This is a widely and uniformly reported measure in eye-tracking studies and meta-analyses [Frazier et al, ; Meia In Task , the proportion of total fixation time for children in the ASD and TD groups was investigated in each of the two rectangular areas of interest showing the dynamic social (DSI) and geometric (DGI) images

There was no significant group difference of mean individual fixation durations There was no significant correlation found between and of the eye tracking measures and symptom severity (SA, RRB and ADOS- total scores) in the ASD For the proportion of fixation time a two-way ANOVA with group and stimuli ( different AOIs: Social, Face, Toy, Toy) as factors revealed significant main effects of stimuli (F,  =
