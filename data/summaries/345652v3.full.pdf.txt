Methods:  Exploratory analyses were performed on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) dataset (n = ) of a phase III randomized placebo-controlled trial to examine the response to nilvadipine in very mild, mild and moderate AD subjects
The outcome measures included total and subscale scores of the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive  (ADAS-Cog ), the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes (CDR-sb) and the AD composite score (ADCOMS), an outcome measure recently developed to detect treatment responses in subjects with prodromal AD
Conclusion:  These data suggest that very mild AD subjects benefited from nilvadipine and that future clinical trials of nilvadipine in this population are keywords: mild Alzheimers disease, nilvadipine, exploratory analysis, cognitive decline, cerebrospinal fluid certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
To evaluate this, a phase III multi-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in Europe to test its efficacy in  In the NILVAD trial, when analyzed as a single population according to the protocol, combined mild and moderate AD subjects did not benefit from nilvadipine treatment
In a subset of the study population for whom cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were available, we examined whether CSF A and tau changes differed between nilvadipine and placebo groups  This -month phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted in  countries across Europe (see elsewhere for additional details ()) and funded by the European Commission under a Framework  Programme Health Theme collaborative project grant
Post-hoc analyses showed that CSF A/A ratios showed a significant reduction in moderate AD subjects treated with nilvadipine compared to the placebo control group (p < 
Post-hoc analyses showed that in the moderate AD group, as compared to placebo, nilvadipine-treated subjects had significant increases in CSF A, total tau and P tau after nilvadipine treatment (p < 
Although analysis of the overall population showed no benefit of nilvadipine, our exploratory studies show that very mild AD subjects experienced less cognitive decline on the total ADAS-Cog  in the nilvadipine-treated group compared to placebo
These findings suggest a differential impact of nilvadipine depending on the  The examination of changes over time in the total ADAS-Cog  scores, stratified by different stages of AD, suggested that, after  weeks of treatment, very mild AD patients treated with nilvadipine showed less cognitive impairment than placebo controls
There were no differences in the total ADAS-Cog  scores between the placebo- and nilvadipine-treated subjects in the mild AD group, and the scores of the moderate certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
When we used the ADCOMS (modified to accommodate the absence of MMSE sub-scales), we observed cognitive benefits in very mild AD subjects treated with  Subjects in different stages of AD demonstrate differential decline in memory, language and praxis traits
