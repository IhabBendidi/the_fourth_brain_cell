It was revealed that the ethanol extract of chokeberry increases the median life expectancy in males and females by % when Drosophila melanogaster is added to the diet for    weeks of life
Recently, acetone extract of chokeberry fruits has shown to increase the median lifespan and locomotor activity in Drosophila (Jo and Imm ) The lifespan extending effect was associated with increased expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) genes and suppression of the methuselah (MTH) gene (Jo and Imm )
The performed RT-PCR assay revealed the effects of ABE on the age-related changes in the expression level of stress response genes
The ABE supplementation has increased expression of heat shock proteins (Hsp, Hsp, Hsp), oxidative stress resistance genes (Keap, NRF, Sod), circadian clock genes (Clk, per) and gene of longevity Sirt thereby increases resistance to oxidative stress and hyperthermia, but (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
The median and maximum (age % mortality) life expectancy and mortality doubling To investigate the effect of ABE feeding on the resistance to oxidative stress, starvation and hyperthermia, the newly enclosed male and female flies were collected and fed a diet with or without the ABE for  days and  days
 and  Time-dependent changes in food preference were analyzed using flies at the age of  and  day old from the control and ABE-treated groups
Further study is needed of the effects of chokeberry extract, with a possible decrease in concentration, on the permeability of the The high levels of phenolic compounds in Aronia may contribute to pronounced bitterness, sourness and astringency of ABE containing food media (Duffy et al ; Sidor and Gramza-Michaowska ) and influence the feeding rate (Ro et al )
Therefore, we were interested in how the aronia extract will affect the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster to various stresses (oxidative, hyperthermia and starvation) at the age of  and  days old (see Fig
We have shown an increase the resistance to oxidative stress of Drosophila at  and  days after treatment with ABE, perhaps it is due to the activation of Nrf and the subsequent decrease in the level of expression of Keap
Perhaps the anthocyanins that contained in Aronia may act as mild stress and activate protective  The obtained data suggest that the most pronounced geroprotective effect of ABE observed when treatment was conducted at the age of - weeks relative to the other tested regimes (Institute of Medicine Food )
 mg/ml is an effective dose for females with regard to locomotor activity, as well as to increase resistance to oxidative stress at  days of life, as well as hyperthermia and starvation at  days of age
 Effects of the ethanolic extract from berries of Aronia melanocarpa on the resistance of Drosophila males (A, C, E) and females (B, D, F) at the age of  and  days old to oxidative stress (A, B), starvation (C, D), and hyperthermia (E, F)
