Taken together, our results reveal a formative role for innate immune myeloid cells in the early pathogenesis of TD and identify -LOX as a necessary enzyme to promote their pro-diabetogenic phenotype in the (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
We utilized a model of chemically-induced -cell oxidative injury that we described previously [], in which zebrafish harboring -cell-specific expression of the gene encoding bacterial nitroreductase (NTR) are treated with the labeled macrophages (Tg(mpeg:eGFP)) to generate a double-transgenic fish line that allows for chemical -cell injury and simultaneous visualization of macrophages in real-time
These data suggest that our MTZ model in zebrafish mimics the early phases of TD where inflammation driven by macrophages contributes to the development of (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

;     Previous studies in mouse models of TD demonstrated that global deletion or chemical inhibition of the enzyme -LOX reduces the early infiltration of macrophages into islets, preserves -cell mass, and prevents hyperglycemia [,]
NOD-Aloxmyel mice exhibited a significant reduction in Alox expression in peritoneal cells compared to control littermates, whereas Alox expression in spleen and pancreatic islets were unchanged (Fig
Aloxmyel mice revealed an increase in mRNAs levels of Pdx, which encodes a key transcription factor that promotes -cell function [], and Cd, which encodes PD-L, an immune checkpoint protein that promotes suppression of immune Myeloid-specific loss of -LOX alters the macrophage and dendritic cell populations in Pancreatic lymph nodes are a site of local antigen presentation and their immune cell composition is reflective of the nature of prevailing autoimmunity []
Flow cytometry of peritoneal macrophages confirmed that the cell surface expression of CXCR protein is significantly reduced in Alox-/- macrophages (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Studies of Unanue and colleagues [] demonstrated that delivery of a neutralizing antibody against the colony stimulating factor  (CSF) receptor at  weeks of age in NOD mice resulted in the depletion of islet-resident macrophages and was accompanied by reduction in CD T cells and dendritic cells in the insulitic milieu and protected against diabetes
These results align with ours, in which deletion of Alox in macrophages on the NOD background resulted in significant reduction in insulitis, CD T cells, and protection from diabetes in both male and (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Collectively, our results emphasize that early intervention in the activity of myeloid cells imparts a disease-modifying effect in TD, but more importantly that depletion of the islet-resident populations of  An important new finding in our studies is the identification that -LOX controls a signaling pathway that affects chemokine receptor expression in macrophages
Although Alox deletion was previously shown to protect against TD in NOD mice [], it has remained unclear if the effect could be attributed to its expression islets, myeloid cells, or both, particularly since proinflammatory cytokines and their signaling are affected by loss of Alox in both cell types ([,]
Therefore, we believe that the remarkable protective phenotype of NOD mice harboring myeloid cell-specific loss of the Alox alleles is (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
