We propose that a small community in the gut microbiota can impair insulin clearance and increase insulin load and the risk of complications was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Aging is associated with increased insulin levels and insulin resistance, but a comparison between mice aged  and  months suggested that hyperinsulinemia associated with this period of aging is was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

However, in mice fed HFD for  weeks, body mass was increased (Figure C) and insulin clearance was lower given the increased area under the curve (AUC) in the plasma insulin concentration versus time (Figure D), relative to age-matched chow diet-fed mice

These data are concordant with a previous report that demonstrated aging did not alter insulin clearance in - and -The microbiota from HFD-fed mice is an independent and transmissible factor that To investigate a causative role for the intestinal microbiota in regulating insulin clearance, we colonized germ-free mice for - weeks with the microbiota from conventional donor mice fed either a chow or HFD containing % of calories from fat (Figure A)
Our findings also indicate that microbial and dietary factors synergize to impair To identify microbial taxa that correlate with impaired insulin clearance during diet-induced obesity, we compared the fecal microbiome characteristics in Chow-R and HFD-R mice at day  (Figure D) and after  weeks of HFD feeding (Figure F) using a pairwise Wilcoxon test of all taxa (collapsed to the genus level)
In the HFD-R group, these taxa were low or absent when mice were fed chow diet, but these  taxa significantly increased in relative abundance when HFD-R mice were switched to HFD, which is the To understand the phylogenetic relationship between the taxa identified in these clusters, we created a phylogenetic tree of the S rRNA genomic sequences for all taxa detected in the recipient germ-free mice (Figure B, and enlarged circular dendrogram in Supplemental Figure was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
