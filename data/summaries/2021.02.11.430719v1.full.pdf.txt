Polygenic prediction of type  diabetes in continental Africans is adversely affected by the limited number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of type  diabetes from Africa, and the poor transferability of European derived polygenic risk scores (PRS) in diverse ethnicities
 years earlier compared to those in the first Conclusions African American derived PRS enhances polygenic prediction of type  (including Africans) in GWAS, promises to provide better tools for precision medicine (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
We set up this study to evaluate the predictivity of European, African American and multi-ethnic derived polygenic risk scores  for type  diabetes in continental Africans
;    *models adjusted for ancestry indicated by  principal components, age, sex and BMI; OR = odds ratio; CI = confidence interval #AUC = area under the curve; for the PRS adjusted for ancestry indicated by five principal components The participants in the th decile of the African American derived PRS had a more than -fold higher risk for developing type  diabetes compared to those in the first decile in both the South African Zulu study (OR = 
Receiver operating curves for the African Americans derived PRS and conventional risk factors for the prediction of type  diabetes in the South African Zulu study
In this study, we set out to compare the polygenic prediction of African American, European and multi-ethnic PRSs for type  diabetes in continental Africans
