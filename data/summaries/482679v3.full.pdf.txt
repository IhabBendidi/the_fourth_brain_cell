Study outcomes included cognitive measures and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data collected in five behavioural and one MRI session in the week The primary behavioural outcomes were: () spatial fluid intelligence, as a latent variable (see Statistical Analysis) measured by the Ravens Progressive Matrices, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, and the BETA-III matrix reasoning test; and () verbal fluid intelligence, as a latent variable measured with the Analogies Task from Berlin Intelligence Structure Test, Syllogisms, and the Verbal Inference Test from the ETS Kit (See Supplement S for complete list)
For detailed description, see study protocol In order to quantify effective concentrations of the investigated drug, subjects blood samples were collected in the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-treated tubes at the first and last cognitive training visit, approximately - minutes after completing the training, to evaluate plasma levels of L-dopa and homovanillic acid
The main analysis used an implementation of structural equation modeling with latent change score modeling () to test the effect of L-dopa versus placebo on the outcomes of cognitive training (see Supplement, Figure S and Table S)

Specifically, the control group exhibited increases of grey matter volume in this region whereas the group that received L-dopa Although post-hoc, we interpret our results to suggest that the exogenous administration of the dopamine precursor may have perturbed a balanced dopaminergic system that previous studies has shown to be involved in training-related effects on performance ()
Further studies are clearly needed to pharmacological interventions may have differential effects, especially in the light of recent findings showing clear regional heterogeneity of age-related decline in dopamine receptor More generally, the negative response to pro-dopaminergic medication observed in the present study suggests that cognitive decline in healthy aging is a complex and multifactorial process, a process that appears to result in balanced physiological states, which, whilst being associated certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
The negative effects of L-dopa supplementation on learning and midbrain structures observed in our study present an urgent need to carefully investigate the longitudinal course of brain changes in de-novo Parkinsons patients, for which early dopamine replacement therapy is currently a subject of debates (, )
Finally, despite the fact that our study is well-powered and the largest of its kind (, ) an additional caution must be advised for making direct generalisations to broader populations, especially to patient We conclude that daily L-dopa supplementation does not enhance cognitive performance and learning during cognitive training in healthy older adults and may in fact have disadvantageous certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
