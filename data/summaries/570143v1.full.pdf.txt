Here we examined a commercial cognitive training program (Activate) in a -week double-blind, pseudo-randomized placebo-controlled trial Based on a priori power analysis, we recruited  healthy older adults - years of age (M = 
Our findings suggest limited benefits of Activate training on cognition and psychosocial wellbeing in healthy older adults, at least under the conditions we certified by peer review) is the author/funder

, test-retest) effects (Collie, Although many commercial CCT programs are available (for a partial list and review, see Simons et al, ), we selected the Activate web-based program because of its focus on training working memory (WM), sustained and divided attention, inhibition, and visuospatial perception
Second, the Activate program had already shown promise of transfer in older adults with depression, with training reported to reduce depressive symptoms and measurably improve cognitive control (as indexed by the Trail-Making and Stroop certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Perhaps the most serious problems revolve around insufficient control conditions, including lack of an appropriate active control group to distinguish intervention effects from those of placebo or other non-specific factors, and failure to account for participants expectations of training outcomes (W
We took particular care in our study design and data collection to ensure: i) reasonable statistical power; ii) use of a dynamic CCT program adaptive to participant performance; iii) use of an active (rather than less-rigorous passive) control condition (Redick, ; Shipstead, Redick, & Engle, ), comprised of a computerized program that would believably pass as cognitive training; iv) control of potential expectancy-mediated placebo effects (W
Boot et al, ; Green et al, ); v) use of consensus transfer measures that the developers of the CCT program agreed should reflect the cognitive processes being trained by their exercises, and that are standard measures used in both clinical and experimental studies, including in previous evaluations of the Activate program; vi) replication and extension of previous findings on Activate improving executive function in older adults (Morimoto et al, ), and of our own work on older adults having higher expectations of CCT (Rabipour & Davidson, ); and vii) double-blind design
Second, previous research has suggested that older adults benefit from CCT to a greater extent when completing the program, at least in part, in supervised group sessions conducted at a center (Lampit, Hallock, & Valenzuela, ; Wadley et al, Dividing the home and lab sessions in this manner permitted us to balance between convenience and quality control
We administered the EAS on three occasions: i) at baseline; ii) after participants received the expectation priming messages (High or Low); and iii) after completing the -week CCT program
Following the training program, we probed participants The intervention, the pirate-themed Activate web program (C Sciences), comprised six adaptive computer games involving WM, sustained and divided attention, inhibition, and visuospatial certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Originally created to enhance school performance in children with impulse-control impairments, the program has more recently been applied to older adults and appears to reduce depressive symptoms as well as executive dysfunction in patients with geriatric depression (Morimoto et al, ; Morimoto et During each session, participants were presented with a choice of three possible games
While we wanted to ensure adequate engagement with the Sudoku puzzles, we also sought to further reduce the possibility that this control program would enhance cognitive function or benefit participant performance on untrained tasks
In the present study, participants completed both the FDS and BDS tasks, but only scores for the BDS were included in our analyses as a measure of executive function (Glisky, Polster, & Trail Making Test (TMT)
Moreover, the distribution of Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden scores (Campbell, Maidment, Fox, Khan, & Boustani, ) Participant retention rate was high: after dropout due to scheduling conflicts (n=), health certified by peer review) is the author/funder
We performed repeated measures MANOVA comparing expectation ratings across the seven cognitive domains between expectation priming condition and CCT program at three times: baseline, after receiving the expectation priming message, and after completing the CCT
We did not find a main effect of program or of expectation condition, or an interaction effect, on expectation ratings in any cognitive domain, certified by peer review) is the author/funder
After correcting for multiple comparisons, we did not find group differences in ratings for any cognitive domain Using repeated measures MANOVA, we evaluated the amount of time participants in each expectation priming condition engaged in the Activate games over the five weeks (Figure a)
Similarly, the high expectation priming condition led to no greater improvement (on training or As in our previous work (Rabipour, Andringa, et al, ; Rabipour & Davidson, ), here we found that older adults were largely optimistic about CCT outcomes before they began the study
Following completion of the program, however, participants were more uncertain about the effectiveness of the CCT in improving cognitive outcomes, with ratings closer to the neutral score in all experimental Participants assigned to the Activate CCT adhered to the program and improved in three out of four of the games training domains, including visual pursuit & category sorting, visual pursuit & inhibition, and pattern completion
Notably, some participants in each of the expectation conditions even continued with the Activate program long certified by peer review) is the author/funder
;    Although participants provided positive feedback, we did not find any effect of expectation priming or of the CCT program on our transfer measures of cognitive or psychosocial function We recruited a self-selected sample of relatively high-functioning older adults, some of whom who were concerned about their cognitive health and likely to partake in cognitive training on their own
However, reported expectation ratings replicated our previous findings, and the subjective questionnaires we administered are Finally, although we conducted an a priori power analysis to determine the minimal required sample size, any effects of this training could be smaller than anticipated and therefore would be certified by peer review) is the author/funder
