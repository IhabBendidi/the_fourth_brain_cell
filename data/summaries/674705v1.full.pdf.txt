In  patients without recurrence, the assessment of Lactobacillus vaginal  flora performed by phase contrast microscopy evidenced a significant improvement form  baseline (p=
Our research showed that  monthly cycles of Polybactum ovules  administered after one course of metronidazole vaginal therapy can reduce the rate of  Bacterial vaginosis recurrence and improve the vaginal milieu, favouring the growth of  vaginal lactobacillus species
Taken together our results confirm that Polibactum is a  safe and effective treatment to reduce BV recurrence rate after a first line therapy with  Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal disorder in women of childbearing  age ()
