Lung function measures recorded at the initial SPARC assessment ( days) were used as baseline, with an outcome of disease progression within one year of SPARC completion defined as % relative decline in FVC or death
Tukey post-hoc analysis We calculated the area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve for the ability of the cumulative IPARC Score to predict disease progression within  months, as well as overall mortality compared with %FVC or %DLCO
The sensitivity and the Kaplan-Meier curves plotted time to disease progression, or overall mortality, against days since completing the questionnaire according to categories of IPARC Score
ROC subsequently assessed the ability of the IPARC Score to predict death compared with lung function recordings in  people with complete data
Highest scores,  or above, may be considered an indicator for follow-up within three months; intermediate scores, -, support review within six months; We use Item Response Theory as a novel application of the methodology to assess patient reported outcome measures [], identifying a concise list of  items from an original  questions that capture the majority of information distinguishing people with high distress
Whilst K-BILD offers an empowering way to self-monitor respiratory health, IPARC should be completed within clinical settings where rapid disease progression is a ROC analysis confirmed that %DLCO was the best measure for predicting one year mortality in this cohort []
This brief and simple tool offers utility in the clinical care of patients with progressive lung fibrosis, whilst future study should address its validity following anti-fibrotic therapy and in other not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
