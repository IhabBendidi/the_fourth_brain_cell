Materials and Methods: We  assembled a clinical expert consortium (CEC) to select relevant clinic-biological features to  be collected for all patients and a cohort management team comprising biologists, clinicians  and computer scientists to design an electronic case report form (eCRF)
 Conclusions: A multidisciplinary endeavour offers complete and harmonized CRFs for AID  clinical investigations that are used in TRANSIMMUNOM and will benefit translational  certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Recent studies have successfully identified molecular signatures associated with  Those results led us to setup an observational clinical trial, TRANSIMMUNOM,  (NCT) the main goal of which was to revisit the nosology of AIDs through a  with one out of  selected AIDs or one out of  control diseases (Figure ), and healthy  donors with no history of autoimmune disorders
 Here we present our electronic CRF (eCRF), designed using an open-source electronic data  capture (EDC) tool, capturing more than  multiparametric coded values from   harmonized clinical and biological parameters per subject included in a multi-disease clinical  trial focusing on  diseases,  areas of clinical investigation and one vast set of routine  biology assays
 Patients with one of the following AIDs, of the AID continuum are recruited for  TRANSIMMUNOM trial (Figure ): familial mediterranean fever (FMF), ulcerative colitis,  certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Altogether, we designed a collection of   CDASH harmonized CRFs recording  parameters with  coded variables systemically  for all the patients and healthy donors included in the TRANSIMMUNOM trial  For  exemplary eCRF, a coded question and expected coded answer are described with the type of values to  Clinical data management is of utmost importance for any clinical study
