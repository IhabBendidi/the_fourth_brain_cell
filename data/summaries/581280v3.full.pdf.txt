Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) is a non-invasive Recent methodological advancements suggest iTBS could be improved through ) treating with multiple sessions per day at optimally-spaced intervals, ) applying a higher overall pulse-dose of stimulation and ) precision targeting of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) to subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) circuit

New antidepressant treatments are needed that are safe, tolerable, Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) is an FDA-approved non-invasive brain stimulation technique for TRD ()
The antidepressant mechanism of rTMS is hypothesized to be mediated in part through indirect inhibitory functional connectivity from L-A more efficient form of rTMS, known as intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), has been developed, which has significantly shortened the duration of treatment sessions from  minutes to  minutes () and produces equivalent antidepressant responses (, )

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using the Breslow test of equality of survival distributions was used to determine if there were significant differences in the number of days to reach response and remission criteria for participants who had a treatment history of conventional Suicidality was assessed using the suicidal ideation subscale of the C-SSRS, item  of the HDRS-, and item  of the MADRS
One month following SAINT, % of participants continued to meet responder criteria (see Supplementary Table  for response and remission certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
, see Supplementary Table ), indicating that participants with a history of conventional rTMS non-response had a similar treatment effect as The mean number of days of SAINT completed until participants met the response criterion (% reduction in HDRS- score) was 
Taken together, these data could explain the limited efficacy of a previously reported accelerated stimulation protocol for depression, which used an inter-session interval of The individualized targeting method used in our study may have also contributed to the high remission rate
