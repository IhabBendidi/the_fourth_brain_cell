While evidence indicates that exposure to PCB and other NDL-PCBs  in early vertebrate development can contribute to neurobehavioral disorders, the basis of  Methods: We assessed a range of effects of several NDL-PCB congeners (PCB,  PCB, PCB, and PCB) on cellular morphologies and synaptic transmission linked to  the proper execution of a sensorimotor response in zebrafish, taking advantage of the well- established neural circuit in this model

NDL-PCB  developmental exposure also adversely affects auditory function in adult rats, including  elevated thresholds of brainstem auditory evoked potentials, auditory deficits at low  frequencies, audiogenic seizures, and reduced auditory startle responses (Crofton et al  ; Goldey et al ; Lilienthal et al , ; Poon et al )
To this end, we examined the effects of different  NDL-PCBs (PCB, PCB, PCB, PCB), in comparison to the DL-PCB and at  different environmentally relevant concentrations, dissecting various steps in the neural   (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February ,

To date, mechanistic studies of neurodevelopmental  effects of NDL-PCBs suggest two major targets: () alterations in neurotransmission,  particularly involving dopamine and serotonin, and consequently disruptions to Ca+ signal  transduction (Campagna et al ; Dervola et al ; Enayah et al ; Fonnum and  Mariussen ; Langeveld et al ), and () loss of outer hair cells (Crofton et al ;  Trnovec et al ) or cochlear development (Goldey et al )

 The restoration of the delayed startle phenotype by haloperidol, together with the increased  levels of a dopamine metabolite and GABA in PCB-exposed larvae (Figure A),  indicates that disruption of dopaminergic and GABAergic signaling between neurons of the  auditory circuit is the dominant effect of PCB-mediated aberrant motor behavior
