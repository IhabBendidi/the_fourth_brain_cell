Blood clot fracture properties are dependent on red blood cell and fibrin contentBehrooz Fereidoonnezhad , Anushree Dwivedi , Sarah Johnson , Ray McCarthy , Patrick McGarry ,*thrombectomy, leads to downstream emboli, resulting in poor clinical outcomes
Finite element cohesive zone modelling of clot fracture experiments show that fibrin fibres become highly aligned in the direction perpendicular to crack propagation, providing a significant toughening mechanism
The results presented in this study provide the first characterization of the fracture behaviour of blood clots and are of key importance for development of next-generation (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Moreover, per-pass analysis of AIS thrombi show that the composition of thrombus fragments retrieved with each pass of a device during MT are different, further supporting the dependence of clot fragmentation on Previous studies have investigated clot hyperelastic and viscoelastic behaviour using compression testing [] and tensile testing [,]

A bespoke experimental procedure for fabrication and fracture testing of compact tension blood clot specimens is developed
Based on histological studies of the composition of clots removed from stroke patients by MT [], tests are performed on three different clot analogue fracture specimen compositions, ranging from high red blood cell (RBC)/low-fibrin clots to low RBC/high-fibrin clots
Such tests, in contrast to standard compression tests, require gripping of a fragile and slippery material Another issue for fracture testing of blood clots arises from the high ratio of toughness to strength of clot, resulting in the significant deformation prior to fracture initiation
Such analogue materials have been shown to exhibit mechanical behaviour that is similar to excised human clots (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

It has previously been established that a decrease in the RBC content of blood clots results in an increase Test samples were prepared the day after formation by cutting the clots into a rectangular shape with two holes for the purpose of gripping using bespoke stainless-steel punches, (Figure a)

Therefore we approximate the value of  for blood clot before the test, based on the value of fracture toughness for soft tissues []
(a) A representative force-displacement curve for fracture test and (b) un-notched compact tension test of blood clot are shown, indicating the work until crack propagation U and the corresponding energy in unnotched test U as well as the force FQ and load-point displacement uQ at the start of crack propagation which (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
