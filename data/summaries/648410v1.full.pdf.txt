The enzyme -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type  has been implicated in regulating cerebrospinal fluid secretion, and its activity is associated with alterations in intracranial pressure in idiopathic investigate indicators of in vivo efficacy of the -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type  inhibitor AZD compared to placebo in idiopathic intracranial hypertension
(Gathercole et al, ),(Sinclair et al, ; Sinclair et al, c) In patients with IIH, resolution of disease (reduced ICP, activity,(Sinclair et al, a; Sinclair et al, c) with a study suggesting that inhibition of -HSD with a non-selective inhibitor lowered intraocular pressure
To test this we conducted a multicenter phase  double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT in IIH using the selective -HSD inhibitor AZD, aiming to assess therapeutic efficacy, safety and tolerability, and investigate in vivo systemic and central nervous system efficacy
;    Participants completed follow-up assessments at , , , , , , ,  and  weeks (Figure The primary outcome for clinical efficacy was the difference in ICP between AZD and placebo, as measured by LP at  weeks
Secondary outcomes included: IIH symptoms, visual function (visual acuity (VA) measured using LogMAR (log of the minimum angle of resolution), perimetric mean deviation (PMD) using Humphrey - central threshold automated perimetry and contrast sensitivity assessed by MARs charts (Mars Perceptrix, USA)), Engineering) to quantify the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) average and maximal values
(Hassan-Smith et al, ; Long et al, ) Plasma and CSF AZD levels were quantified by an external laboratory (Alderley Global -HSD activity was evaluated through quantification of  hour urinary ((THF+THF):THE) alongside a stable ratio of total urinary cortisol (F): total urinary cortisone Inhibition of hepatic -HSD activity was informed by measuring first-pass metabolism of mg of oral prednisone to prednisolone
) in the placebo group (mean change: At weeks  and , there were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups in IIH symptoms (Suppl
There was no difference in serum cortisol, testosterone or androstenedione, although serum DHEAS, a marker of adrenal androgen production was higher at  weeks in the AZD group (mean difference certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Serum and CSF cortisol and cortisone were examined in the placebo and AZD groups at baseline and at  weeks
); however, at week  there was a significant decrease in the CSF cortisol:cortisone in the AZD group compared to placebo (p=
Our primary hypothesis stated that -HSD inhibition in IIH patients would reduce CSF secretion and lower ICP while being safe and tolerable following  weeks of treatment
There was a significant reduction in ICP in the AZD and not the placebo group certified by peer review) is the author/funder
