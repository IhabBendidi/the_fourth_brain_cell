Human extinction learning is accelerated by an angiotensin antagonist via ventromedial prefrontal cortex and its connections with basolateral amygdalaClinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Autism Clinic for Translational Research, Brain and Mind Centre, Central Clinical Youth Mental Health Unit, Brain and Mind Centre, Central Clinical School, Faculty of not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
However, the efficacy of pharmacological modulation of the RA system to enhance threat extinction in humans pre-extinction administration of the angiotensin II type  receptor antagonist losartan On the neural level the acceleration of extinction was accompanied by threat-signal analysis further revealed that that losartan reduced the neural threat expression, particularly in the vmPFC, and confirmed that acceleration of extinction critically provide the first evidence for a pivotal role of the RA system in extinction learning in humans and suggest that adjunct losartan administration can be leveraged to facilitate not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
