We hypothesized that the combination of the complications (NSQIP-SC) or risk of death (NSQIP-D), and cognitive tests of executive function (Trail Making Test A and B [TMTA, TMTB]), could provide a parsimonious model to predict Methods: Data were collected from  adults (>yo) undergoing major non-cardiac surgery
An ideal model that is clinically applicable would be predictive of delirium incidence and its severity as well as parsimonious, such that it would use a limited number of variables that can The ability to identify high-risk individuals prior to their surgery is critical to delirium prevention
;    NSQIP risk scores with a measure of executive function among other potential delirium risk factors to develop a parsimonious model to predict postoperative delirium incidence and This analysis is a sub-study drawn from an ongoing prospective perioperative cohort study that is approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Health Sciences Institutional Review Board Between August  and May , , potential participants were screened from vascular, urology, general and spine surgical clinics (HL, ST, LT, PR, JK, MD, BH, RDS)
HL, First, to evaluate the predictive ability of NSQIP-SC over NSQIP-D (as composites of the predisposing and precipitating factors), logistic (DELYN) regression models were completed and compared also to ASA classification and Framingham risk (as measures of predisposing factors only)
No significant differences were identified between the non-delirious and delirious groups in terms of age, sex, education level, past/present tobacco use, blood pressure metrics, We confirmed preoperative NSQIP-SC as a robust predictor of postoperative delirium incidence using single factor logistic regression models for NSQIP-SC and NSQIP-D
The reported odds ratios, coefficients, AUROC, sensitivity and specificity, and model fit statistics including AIC and BIC are in In order to derive a potential delirium incidence prediction model we followed TRIPOD guidelines to apply a statistical shrinkage technique (LASSO) followed by Best Subsets regression using age, sex, NSQIP-SC, NSQIP-D, tobacco pack years, vascular surgery, ASA classification, Framingham CVD, GDS, TMTA, TMTB, and blood pressure metrics
A two-factor logistic regression model containing preoperative NSQIP-SC and TMTB to predict postoperative delirium incidence was selected as this model demonstrated optimal model fit accurate model calibration
) did not demonstrate a strong predictive The model demonstrating optimal fit statistics for postoperative peak delirium severity was a two-factor linear regression model containing preoperative NSQIP-SC and TMTB using LASSO and Best Subsets regression
Age, sex, NSQIP-D, ASA, tobacco pack years, vascular surgery, Framingham CVD, GDS, TMTA, and blood pressure metrics Our analysis of a prospective perioperative cohort found NSQIP-SC to be a robust predictor of postoperative delirium incidence and severity
The modeling procedures, LASSO and Best Subsets regression, did not identify vascular burden, comorbidities, smoking history, and depression as important predictors although these variables have been identified as significant risk factors for postoperative delirium incidence in prior research
The NSQIP-SC score combines several potential preoperative risk factors for delirium (age, functional status, current tobacco use, vascular burden) with the precipitating event, the planned surgery, and provides a single risk score that is easy to interpret, i
