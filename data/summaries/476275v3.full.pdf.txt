We aim to assess the effects of a continuous care intervention (CCI) on retention, glycemic control, weight, body composition, cardiovascular, liver, kidney, thyroid, inflammatory markers, diabetes medication usage and disease outcomes at  years in adults with type  diabetes (TD)
All the reported CONCLUSIONS: The CCI sustained long-term beneficial effects on multiple clinical markers of diabetes and cardiometabolic health at  years while utilizing less medication
Three non-pharmaceutical approaches have demonstrated high rates of at least temporary TD diabetes reversal or remission: bariatric surgery, very low calorie diets (VLCD), and nutritional ketosis achieved through carbohydrate restriction(,,)
Low-carbohydrate diets have consistently elicited improvements in TD, metabolic disease, and obesity up to not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
We have previously reported  year outcomes of an open-label, non-randomized, controlled, longitudinal study with  continuous care intervention (CCI) and  usual care (UC) participants with TD()
Secondary aims included: () investigating the effect of the CCI on bone mineral density, visceral fat composition, cardiovascular risk factors, liver, kidney, thyroid and inflammatory markers; diabetes medication use, and disease outcomes (e
Participants in the CCI accessed a remote care team consisting of a health coach and medical provider and reported routine biomarkers (weight, blood glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate [BHB]) through a web-based application (app)
Long-term body composition changes assessed in CCI participants included bone mineral density (BMD), abdominal fat content (CAF and A/G ratio), and lower extremities lean mss (LELM)
Changes in overall diabetes medication use, use by class, and insulin dose were tracked over the two years of the trial The prevalence of TD (diabetes reversal, partial and complete remission), metabolic syndrome, suspected steatosis and absence of fibrosis were evaluated at  years in the CCI and UC groups using the criteria provided in Supplementary Table  (assignment references listed in the supplementary)
;    Adverse events encountered in the study were reported to the Principal Investigator and reviewed Clinical anthropometrics and laboratory blood analytes measurements were obtained at baseline,  year, and  years from the CCI and UC participants
The CCI participants were also assessed for total body composition changes at baseline,  and  years using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Lunar GE Prodigy, Madison, WI) and analyzed using GE Encore software(v

;     Following  years of a remote continuous care intervention supporting medical and lifestyle changes, the CCI participants demonstrated improved HbAc, fasting glucose and insulin, and HOMA-IR
This study observed a modest increase in HbAc and weight between  and  years in CCI participants suggesting some reduction in long-term effectiveness
Greater diabetes remission in the CCI versus Look AHEAD ILI could result from differences in the dietary intervention(), patients ability to self-select their lifestyle or effectiveness of continuous remote care
The differing findings of ketogenic diet on bone mass between adults and children could be due to differential effects on developed and This studys strengths include its size and prospective, longitudinal data collection from two participant groups (CCI and UC) which allowed statistical analysis by LMMs to investigate intervention time and treatment effects
Interpretation of DXA body composition was limited to subregion analyses due to to the scanner not At  years, the CCI, including remote medical management with instruction in nutritional ketosis, led to improvements in blood glucose, insulin, HbAc, weight, blood pressure, triglycerides, liver function, and inflammation and reduced dependence upon medication
