The causative effect of the mutation was verified with a high level of confidence by targeting Dusp with CRISPR/Cas in NOD/NckL mice: in these animals a higher incidence of diabetes was observed
Similar timing of islet antigen presentation was observed in NOD/NckH and NOD/NckL mice as assessed by a well-established method:  an identical capacity of diabetogenic cells expressing the transgenic BDC
When single locus linkage analysis was performed using Linkage Analyzer the early age of TD onset in the NOD/NckH line was mapped to a recessive missense mutation of NOD/NckH origin in Dusp, encoding the dual specificity phosphatase  (DUSP), also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase  (MKP) (Figure )
CR# mice carrying the homozygous putative null DuspYX mutation showed a TD incidence similar to that of NOD/NckH and (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
A panel of  validated variant loci distinguishing NOD/NckH and Nod/NckL sublines was used to map the high diabetes incidence phenotype in F mice
