This study examined the effects of a  combined intervention of mindfulness meditation followed by aerobic walking exercise in chronic  low back pain (cLBP) patients
Over a -week period, participants in the MedExT group performed -  minutes of guided meditation followed by  minutes of moderate intensity walking exercise   days per week
Mean ratings of low back pain intensity and  unpleasantness significantly improved with MedExT from before the study to during  participation, respectively (intensity p<

As these therapies (exercise and meditation) independently improve disability and pain, the  Meditation and Exercise to Treat chronic low back trial (MedExT) tested the effects of a -week  intervention of a guided mindfulness meditation program combined with moderate intensity  walking exercise performed  days per week in chronic low back pain (cLBP) patients
We  hypothesized that this intervention would improve disability (primary outcome), pain, anxiety and  increase mindfulness compared to control participants

Following baseline testing, treatment assignments were disclosed to the  Within one week of performing baseline pain assessments (average time between  baseline and first intervention session =  days), participants completed their first in-clinic  intervention session

The Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) [] was  administered prior to the mindfulness training session and again at the exit session for MedExT  Pain was assessed using quantitative sensory testing methods (described below), as  well as self-report measures of pain using a visual analog scale (VAS) consisting of a cm line  with the numbers  and  at either end for intensity and unpleasantness ratings

During the exit session,  participants evaluated VAS ratings of average low back pain intensity and unpleasantness that  they remembered experiencing before the start of the study and after the  weeks of the  intervention period
After subtracting steps taken by the MedExT  group during their -minute exercise session, we found no statistically significant difference   Our primary outcome was the effect of treatment on post-intervention scores of disability  as measured by the RMDQ

;     In the current study, we assessed the effect of a combined intervention of mindfulness  meditation followed by aerobic walking exercise in chronic low back pain
The main findings of  this study indicate that meditation and exercise together were able to reduce disability, increase  mindfulness and decrease self-reported ratings of low back pain
First and  foremost, previous studies have tested MBSR [, , , , , ] and mindfulness meditation  [] alone, as well as aerobic walking exercise programs [, , , , , , , ] in low  back pain patients
These paradoxical effects are consistent with that of a  previous study that tested aerobic treadmill walking exercise on painful QST in healthy  participants []
In particular, the  finding that a majority of MedExT group participants found the most beneficial component of the  intervention was the combination of the exercise and meditation suggests the potential for  synergistic effects in this study
