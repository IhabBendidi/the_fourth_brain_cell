To help prioritize lead compounds for the cellular antiviral assay against SARS-CoV-, we developed the cell-based FlipGFP assay that is suitable for quantifying the intracellular enzymatic inhibition potency of PLpro inhibitors in the BSL- setting
Two compounds selected from the FlipGFP-PLpro assay, Jun-- and Jun--, inhibited SARS-CoV- replication in Caco- hACE cells with EC values of 
Overall, the PLpro inhibitors identified in this study represent promising starting points for further development as SARS-CoV- antivirals, and FlipGFP-PLpro assay might be a suitable surrogate for screening PLpro (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
A substantial morbidity and mortality associated with COVID- infection is caused by cytokine storm, and suppressing host immune response using dexamethasone and baricitinib has been shown to provide therapeutic inhibitors,,- and the Pfizer compound PF- currently in phase  clinical trial In comparison, PLpro represents a more challenging drug target, and GRL remains one of the most potent PLpro inhibitors reported to date despite several high-PLpro share a sequence identity of % and similarity of %, GRL was also repurposed for SARS-CoV- PLpro and it was reported to inhibit SARS-CoV- PLpro with (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Upon validating the hits using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) and native mass spectrometry binding assays, a focused library of structural analogs were designed and tested to dissect the inhibit SARS-CoV- PLpro with submicromolar potency
To prioritize lead compounds for the antiviral assay against SARS-CoV-, we developed the FlipGFP assay that is suitable for quantifying the intracellular activity of PLpro inhibitors in the BSL setting
Two compounds selected from the FlipGFP PLpro assay, Jun-- and Jun--, showed -fold improvement than GRL in the cellular antiviral assay against SARS-CoV-
X-ray crystal structures showed that binding of GRL to the wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV- PLpro induced a conformational change in the BL loop to the more closed for further development as SARS-CoV- antivirals, and FlipGFP PLpro assay might be useful in testing the cellular activity of PLpro inhibitors in the BSL- setting

Based on the FlipGFP-PLpro assay results, we selected two compounds Jun-- and Jun-- and tested their cellular antiviral activity against the infectious SARS-CoV- in two cell lines, the Caco- hACE, and the Vero E
  These similarities would indicate that PLpro inhibitors might retain their activity Previous attempts to discover SARS-CoV- PLpro inhibitors through HTS by others have failed to identify hits with improved enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
