In addition, TH decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, inflammatory cell infiltration, and lung remodeling in a murine model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis
 Following lung injury, fibroblasts transition to myofibroblasts through stimulatory factors such as TGF-,  which further induce the production of fibrotic markers including alpha smooth muscle actin (-SMA),  collagen, and fibronectin (, )
This model reproduces several phenotypic features of human  IPF, including peripheral alveolar septal thickening and acute cytokine production resolving in fibrosis (,  Murine CBL/ embryonic lung fibroblasts (MEFs; ATCC, Manassa, VA) and HFL- cells were cultured  in complete growth medium supplemented with L-glutamine,  U/mL penicillin,  g/mL  streptomycin, and % FBS
 Bleomycin-treated mice that received TH treatment showed reduced lung damage, with lesser degrees  of alveolar structural collapse, less septal thickening of the alveoli, and less immune cell influx as indicated  by the H&E stain (Figure A)
 Immunofluorescent staining of murine lung sections revealed decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO),  fibronectin, COLA, and OGG staining compared to the vehicle bleomycin control group (Figure D)
 Importantly, this confirms the potent and specific activity of TH to decrease OGG in fibrosis-inducing  In this study, in vivo efficacy of TH was tested using an intratracheal bleomycin model of fibrotic lung  damage
Additionally, TGF- was shown  to be reduced in murine BALF, plasma, and lung homogenate following TH treatment as compared to  vehicle/bleomycin treated mice
Murine albumin  content was significantly decreased in the BALF following TH treatment as compared to  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Inflammatory cell incursion into the lung environment  plays a role in IPF progression and severity (, ), with limitation of lung inflammation providing a  Histological analysis of TH murine lung samples revealed significantly decreased levels of collagen  deposition in lung tissues compared to vehicle/bleomycin treated samples

Immunofluorescent staining of murine lung slices (D) revealed decreased levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), fibronectin, OGG, and COLA following TH treatment compared to both vehicle/bleomycin and dexamethasone/bleomycin groups (scale bar= m)
