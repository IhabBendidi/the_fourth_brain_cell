Low Field Magnetic Stimulation is a potentially rapid-acting treatment for depression with mood-enhancing effects in as little as one -minute session
We examined whether LFMS also has rapid mood-enhancing effectsin treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, and whether these effects are dose-dependent
We hypothesized thatrelative to participants randomized to the sham condition, measures of mood would be greater innot certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

Table  shows the means and standard deviations of mood ratings (HAMD-, PANAS-Positive,PANAS-Negative, and VAS) in the active-LFMS and sham groups at baseline and upon comple-tion of the third and final treatment session
Among these tests, the mid-treatment differences between active LFMS and sham did not reachsignificance on HAMD-, PANAS-Negative, or VAS after correcting for multiple comparisons
