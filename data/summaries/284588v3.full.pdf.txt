The objective of this study is to evaluate whether referral to a telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle service for patients with knee osteoarthritis, who are overweight or obese, is cost-effective controlled trial We randomised  patients with knee osteoarthritis to an intervention or usual care control group in a : ratio
For this economic evaluation, the primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and secondary outcomes included pain intensity, disability, weight, and body mass index (BMI)
Conclusions: From a societal perspective, telephone-based weight loss support, provided using an existing non-disease specific -month weight management and healthy lifestyle service was not cost-effective in comparison with usual care for overweight and obese patients with knee certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
While telephone-based behavioural interventions targeting weight loss are used routinely in the general populations, the cost-effectiveness of referring patients with knee Given the scarce resources in healthcare, policy-makers are increasingly requiring evidence of economic value for healthcare interventions to make informed decisions about how to allocate approaches is important
Recently, we conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) using an existing non-disease specific telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle service for certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

For pain intensity and BMI, this probability decreased with increasing values of willingness-We found that referral to a telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle service was not cost-effective from a societal perspective compared with usual care, for patients with knee osteoarthritis who are overweight or obese
Since many patients with osteoarthritis do not receive recommended treatments via clinical models of care,, understanding why telephone-based interventions are reported to be as effective as face-to-face interventions but not cost-effective, is an important consideration to inform An important strength of the present study is the pragmatic RCT design
