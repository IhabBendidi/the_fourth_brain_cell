Here, we used an integrative workflow combining mass spectrometric peptide  library construction, in silico anticancer peptide screening, and in vitro leukemic cell studies  to discover a novel anti-leukemic peptide owning +charges and alpha-helical structure,  namely HMP-S, from human breast milk
We applied a robust workflow integrating the  occurring human milk peptide library in silico screening based on physicochemical,  structural, and predictive anticancer properties by machine learning algorithms to prioritize  candidates for functional studies of synthetic peptides to determine anti-leukemic activity  and the mode of action

Human milk peptide fractionation and cytotoxicity profiles against leukemic  and normal cells
The crude milk peptides were resuspended in the culture medium and then  treated to Jurkat and FHsInt cells for - days (n= biological replication)
(C) Also, Jurkat and FHsInt cells were treated with the  eluted fractions  of human milk peptides of  individual volunteer mothers for - days
  comparing to non-treatment condition (n= individual milk specimens with  technical  Peptide identification, library construction, and in silico anti-cancer peptide screening  Eleven fractions (from one crude and ten step-wised ACN eluates) of human milk  peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS
As a result, eight human milk peptides and one bovine milk  peptide (as a positive ACP control) from various prioritization based on net charges,  secondary structures, and the predicted anticancer properties were selected for further  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
;    HMP-S killed leukemic cells but not normal cells or solid tumor cell lines  Figure A illustrated eight selected human milk-derived peptides and a known bovine  milk-derived anticancer peptide synthesized for cancer cytotoxicity screening using trypan  blue staining
These results showed that HMP-S, the highest cationic charged peptide (+  net charge) with -helical structure, had higher inhibitory activity than the other human milk- derived peptides against four leukemic cell lines, including Jurkat, Raji, RS;, and Sup- B cells (Figure B)
Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of the HMP-S  treated Jurkat leukemic cell lines was confirmed by the colony-forming assay using soft agar,  as shown in Figure B

Effect of the  synthetic human milk peptides on leukemic and non- leukemic cell lines
(A) After the combination of physicochemical properties with cationic  peptides, helical structure, and machine learning prediction, the  synthetic human milk  peptides (HMPs) and the positive control (BMP-S) (the details of the selected peptides  were summarized in Table S) were examined for anti-leukemic activity
(B) Four  leukemic cell lines, including Jurkat, Raji, RS; and Sup-B, were treated with   synthetic HMPs and BMP-S at  M to observe %cell death after  h treatment using  trypan blue exclusion assay under light microscope
 Future research on peptide modification, together with the efficacy studies in preclinical  animal models or patients derived leukemic cells ex vivo, is warranted to develop HMP-S  Human milk collection
