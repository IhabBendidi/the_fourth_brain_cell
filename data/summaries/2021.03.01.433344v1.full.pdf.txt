In vitro screening of herbal medicinal products for their supportive curing potential in the context of SARS-CoV-(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
Here we describe the results derived by  in	vitro screening of five herbal medicinal products with regard to their potential to i) interfere  with the binding of the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE) receptor with the SARS- CoV- Spike S protein, ii) modulate the release of the human defensin HBD and cathelicidin LL-  from human A lung cells upon Spike S protein stimulation and iii) modulate the release of  IFN- from activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
The investigated  extracts were:	 Sinupret extract (SINx), Bronchipret thyme-ivy (BRO TE), Bronchipret thyme- Methods:	The inhibitory effect of the herbal medicinal products on the binding interaction of  Spike S protein and the human ACE receptor was measured by ELISA
Co-treatment of A cells with IMU or BRO TP together with SARS-CoV- spike protein  significantly upregulated mRNA expression (IMU) and release (IMU and BRO TP) of HBD and LL- Conclusions:	 The in	 vitro screening results provide first evidence for an immune activating  potential of some of the tested herbal medicinal extracts in the context of SARS-CoV-
In this pilot screening study, five herbal medicinal products,  marketed for the treatment against respiratory infections (Bachert, ; Rossi et al, ; Seibel  et al, ; Seibel et al, ), were explored for their potential to i) interfere with the binding  of the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE) receptor with the SARS-CoV- spike  protein
ii) We investigated whether the extracts can modulate the release of the defensin HBD  and cathelicidin LL- from human A lung cells upon SARS-CoV- spike protein stimulation
;    The inhibitory potential of the extracts between the SARS-CoV- spike protein and the ACE  receptor was tested in a cell free assay
We then treated the cells with Sars-CoV- Spike S protein together with the extracts for  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity

Using different screening assays, we show  here that extracts of marketed herbal medicinal products elicit potential beneficial effects in	vitro	 in terms of cellular defense activation upon challenge with SARS-CoV- spike protein or peptide  The first step of viral infection is the interaction of the virus with the host cell
 But, IMU and BRO TP also activated the human innate immune defense by increasing the level of  defensin HBD and/or cathelicidin LL upon SARS-CoV- spike protein stimulation and this was  evident at much lower concentrations
 BRO TE and SINx extracts could be shown in the present study to further boost the immune  response of PBMC in terms of intracellular IFN- expression, which was activated by a mixture  including SARS-CoV- spike peptides
Human A lung cells were cultured for  days and exposed to A) IMU or B) BRO  TP for different time points with and without Sars-CoV- Spike S protein stimulation
