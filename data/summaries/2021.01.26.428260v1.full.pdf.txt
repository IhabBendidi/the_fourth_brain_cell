One sentence of summary: Deficiency of the transcription factor HNFA biases islet endocrine cell fate towards a-cells, impairs intracellular calcium homeostasis and insulin exocytosis, alters the stoichiometry of insulin to C-peptide release, and leads to an accumulation of abnormal insulin Abstract: Mutations in HNFA cause Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young type  (MODY), the most prevalent form of monogenic diabetes
In HNFA deficient -cells, glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea drug used in the treatment of MODY patients, increases intracellular calcium to levels beyond those achieved by glucose, and restores C-peptide and insulin secretion to a normal stoichiometric ratio
Here we show that human stem cell-based models of HNFA deficiency shows islet developmental bias towards a-cells, altered insulin granule morphology and the stoichiometry of insulin:C-peptide secretion in vitro and in vivo
The ability of HNFA KO cells to differentiate to all endocrine cell types enabled the comparison of transcriptional HNFA deficiency impairs a network of genes required for calcium signaling, glucose-To determine the transcriptional consequences of HNFA deficiency in sc-cells, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing was performed in INS-GFP sorted -like cells derived from hESC HNFA KO and WT lines in vitro
These genes are required for calcium To determine the molecular consequences of HNFA deficiency in other endocrine cell types, we analyzed mono-hormonal sca-like cells (cluster a), characterized by high glucagon and low insulin expression (Fig
SA) and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion compared to WT scb-like cells and compared to human pancreatic islets in vitro (Fig
The milder phenotypes of cells deficient for single target genes compared to HNFA KO cells suggests that the combined effects on several HNFA To interrogate the function of hESC HNFA KO b-cells in vivo, we monitored circulating human insulin and C-peptide concentrations in euglycemic mice transplanted with sc-islet-like clusters
In mice transplanted with hESC HNFA KO b-cells, plasma human C-peptide concentrations increased to a maximum of  pM at  weeks post-transplantation (Fig
During fasting and following an iPGTT, mice transplanted with hESC HNFA WT -cells displayed normal human insulin and C-peptide secretion profiles (Fig
In contrast, hESC HNFA KO -cells were non-responsive to glucose: plasma human C-peptide was not decreased by fasting and did not increase after glucose injection with concentrations significantly lower than in mice transplanted with hESC HNFA WT -cells (Fig
released in a constitutive manner independent of metabolic state, resulting in an altered ratio of In contrast to glucose, intra-peritoneal injection of the sulfonylurea drug, glibenclamide, in mice transplanted with hESC HNFA KO -cells showed a significant increase in C-peptide  minutes after glibenclamide injection (Fig
Surprisingly, human insulin concentrations in mice transplanted with hESC HNFA KO -cells increased from undetectable levels to  mU/L, reaching levels comparable to those in the control group (Fig
These results show that HNFA is required for normal insulin granule formation HNFA deficient sc-cells are unable to maintain glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice To test the ability of hESC HNFA KO -cells to maintain in vivo normoglycemia, endogenous murine -cells were ablated by the administration of streptozotocin (STZ)  weeks post-transplantation
In vivo, circulating plasma human C-peptide from mice transplanted with HNFA WT or HNFA KO cells was unchanged or increased post STZ treatment (Fig
In contrast, mice transplanted with hESC HNFA KO -cells did not increase human C-peptide secretion (Fig
No significant differences were found in endocrine cell types (sca-, scb- and sc-like cells) between HNFA WT and heterozygous cell lines at day  of To determine the consequences of heterozygosity for HNFA in our MODY patient lines for the bias towards a-cell fate, we measured the percentage of glucagon cells co-expressing C-peptide in two MODY iPSC Het (+/ins and +/RQ) lines in vitro
To determine the pathogenicity of the HNFA RQ mutation, we knocked out of the HNFA wildtype allele in a MODY iPSC Het line (RQ/-), which resulted in a significant ~% increase in GCG and CPEP co-expressing cells compared to the RQ-corrected WT control lines (Fig
HNFA haploinsufficiency gradually impairs sc-cell functional capacity in the context of In order to assess the developmental potential of MODY patient-specific mutations in vivo, we transplanted pancreatic islet-like clusters derived from iPSCs using identical methods as previously described
These results are consistent with our iPSC in vitro results; however, a recent study from cadaveric MODY human islets with a TM heterozygous mutation in DNA-binding domain (), showed a bias of endocrine cells toward the a-cell fate (Fig
In mice transplanted with iPSC-derived cells from MODY patient (+/RQ) and RQ-corrected WT (+/+) isogenic lines, circulating human C-peptide (Fig
Transplantation of mice with hESC HNFA Het (+/-) and hESC HNFA RQ homozygous (RQ/RQ) line resulted in low circulating concentrations of human C-peptide over thirty weeks post transplantation (Fig
To further interrogate the consequence of the RQ mutation in b-cells function and evaluate (iPGTT) in mice transplanted with the MODY isogenic lines (RQ Het and RQ-corrected WT), as these iPSC lines allowed the reliable generation of transplanted mice with high C-peptide and insulin levels over thirty weeks post transplantation (Fig
Here we report the use of stem cell-derived islets containing HNFA mutations to elucidate the molecular basis for apparent -cell dysregulation of insulin secretion in HNFA hESC null and MODY hypomorphic patient lines
Based on in vitro and in vivo developmental, morphological and functional assessments of stem cell-derived islets, as well as measurements of plasma concentrations of insulin and C-peptide in nine MODY patients, we conclude that HNFA regulates endocrine cell fate, normal -cell granule formation and function, including calcium-mediated exocytosis of insulin-containing granules, and the resultant stoichiometric secretion of Hypomorphic mutations in HNFA perturb expression of genes important in -cell identity such as PAX, leading to increases in glucagon gene expression, a-cell number and in the a:b-cell ratio in mature islets
