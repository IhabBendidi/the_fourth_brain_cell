Brain considered a spheric, ellipsoid model and estimated absolute brain volume (EABV) calculated by substracting two lateral ventricular volumes from the total brain One hundred and twenty one preterm infants under a birthweight of  g and  weeks of gestational age included in this study
Advanced resuscitation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and late onset sepsis found to be independent risk factors for low Estimated absolute brain volume could be calculated and estimated by two dimensional Key words: cranial ultrasonography, brain volume, ventricular volume, very low birth not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
We hypothesized that we can calculate the absolute brain volume by subtracting the ventricular volumes from the total brain volume measured and calculated with two Consequently the main aim of this study was to measure D distances obtained by not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
, To the best of our knowledge this is the first study which calculates and estimates absolute brain volume with D cranial ultrasound measurements in very low birth weight infants
Liao et al studied preterm infants near - weeks of gestation, who are at risk of developing ventricular dilation ()
