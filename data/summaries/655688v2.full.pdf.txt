While low-dose chemotherapy reduces MDSCs in preclinical models, the use of this strategy to reduce MDSCs Methods: A phase / dose-escalation clinical trial was conducted in recurrent glioblastoma patients treated - days prior to surgery with low-dose chemotherapy via capecitabine followed progression-free and overall survival, were measured, along with safety and toxicity profiles
Increased cytotoxic immune infiltration was observed after low-dose capecitabine compared to untreated GBM patients in the  mg and  mg tolerated in GBM patients and was associated with a reduction in circulating MDSC levels and an certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Based on the hypothesis that this treatment approach would reduce immune suppression, we also analyzed circulating immune cells via flow cytometry and evaluated the immune profile of treated tumors with mass certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Of note, patient  in the  mg bid capecitabine treatment cohort (the only patient who did not have a reduction in peripheral MDSCs post-surgery) was noted to have multifocal GBM at the time of recurrence and enrollment in the trial  The distal site of recurrence was not resected, and the patient progressed  month later at that lesion site
Using a similar flow cytometry approach, analysis of peripheral T cell populations (CD+, CD+, CD+, T regulatory cells) showed no change in the circulation at any dose of capecitabine or in response to surgery certified by peer review) is the author/funder
In addition, the application of a recently published machine-learning algorithm using the R package CytoDx to the intratumoral CyTOF data revealed that cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen  (CTLA-) levels were the most predictive marker to distinguish untreated versus capecitabine-treated patients, and this is represented as a decision tree of predictions showing the predicted cell population changes that occur upon treatment (Figure A)
In this trial, the capecitabine dose ( mg bid) that led to the maximal decrease in peripheral immunosuppressive MDSCs was four- to five-fold lower than that used in colorectal cancer ( mg bid) and pancreatic cancer ( mg bid) , and increasing the dose of drug (to  mg bid) did not offer further reductions in intratumoral immune-activating cell subsets, suggesting that these doses were more specific for certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Future studies should now investigate this approach in newly diagnosed GBM patients at the  mg bid dose, based on our observation that newly diagnosed patients have an overall increase in MDSC levels over time (which low-dose capecitabine was demonstrated to This study assessed the paradigm of an immunomodulatory approach based not on activating T cells but rather relieving immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment by targeting MDSCs
Capecitabine was given - days prior to a clinically indicated surgical resection and then continued post-operatively in -day cycles with periodic blood draws to assess peripheral blood immune cell populations over the course of the trial (Figure )
As this trial was for patients with recurrent GBM, bevacizumab was included in addition to the low-dose capecitabine so that patients also received standard-of-care therapy (this combination at full doses has been proven The primary endpoint of the study was the degree of reduction in the concentration of circulating MDSCs
