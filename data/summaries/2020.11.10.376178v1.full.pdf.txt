In its soluble form, SorCS positively correlates  with body mass index and inversely with plasma glucose in diabetic patients, and in mouse models  of insulin resistance, overexpression or exogenous administration of the monomeric soluble  receptor domain restores insulin sensitivity
We conclude that SorCS is a critical regulator of  peripheral insulin sensitivity operating in both a cell autonomous and endocrine manner, and we  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Regardless the isoform, the extracellular domain (sol-SorCS) can be efficiently  liberated from the plasma membrane by ADAM/TACE mediated cleavage but the biological  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
To investigate the function specifically of the full-length receptor variants  we generated a mouse model (SorcsD-), in which exons - had been deleted leaving the first   exons intact to allow production of only sol-SorCS (Extended Data Fig
Consistent  with genetic studies in mice, rats and humans-, the glycemic phenotype was present only in female  SorcsD- mice inasmuch plasma glucose in the male transgenics remained normal up till  weeks of  age (Extended Data Fig

To address this, we studied IR signaling in  differentiated myocyte cultures from SorcsD- mice after insulin stimulation in the presence of  increasing concentrations of exogenous sol-SorCS (Fig
The data suggested  that sol-SorCS may act as an adipokine to counteract the increased plasma glucose levels that commonly  To establish a glucose lowering and insulin sensitizing effect of sol-SorCS in vivo, we  injected an adenovirus encoding human sol-SorCS (AV-sol-SorCS) or AV-LacZ (encoding - (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Notably, three weeks post injection, glycated hemoglobin  (HbAc) had increased considerably in the AV-LacZ group but it stayed unchanged in the AV-sol- SorCS group indicating a long-lasting beneficial effect of the soluble receptor in reducing plasma  In cells, full-length dimeric SorCS binds exclusively to the proIRs whereas monomeric  SorCS recognizes mature IR (Fig e-h)
To demonstrate this, we purified monomeric  and dimeric sol-SorCS from transfected CHO cells and injected db/db mice with each form  intraperitoneally  hrs and  hr prior to glucose tolerance test
