This placebo-controlled study examined whether fluoxetine can enhance neuroplasticity and  improve vision in adults with amblyopia
The treatment period included eye patching and computerized   A total of  subjects were enrolled in the study, with  and  subjects randomly assigned to the  fluoxetine and control group, respectively
 The study was designed to include a placebo control group for the medication only, and all participating  subjects followed the same daily patching and training instructions
The visual acuity improvements observed in  both groups were maintained  to  weeks after discontinuing all treatments (medication, eye patching,  and perceptual training)
Binocularity, contrast  sensitivity and crowded near visual acuity improved in both the control and fluoxetine groups
Following fluoxetine treatment and perceptual  training, both subjects had almost normal contrast sensitivity ( weeks: 
  Our clinical study protocol also included prespecified subgroup analyses, which assessed the effect of  the severity of amblyopia (moderate/severe), binocularity (suppression/normal fusion), sex (female/male),  compliance with software-based training (%/<%), and age (</ years) on changes in visual  acuity (logMAR)
  The current study examined whether fluoxetine, an SSRI known to modulate adult rat visual cortex  plasticity, can enhance the effects of patching/computer-based perceptual training combination therapy  in adults with amblyopia
Our results are in agreement with those of Li et al,  who found that % of adult amblyopic subjects had a substantial improvement in visual acuity following  video game-based perceptual training
;     The change in visual acuity after  weeks of study medication/perceptual training therapy was not  significantly different between subjects taking fluoxetine and subjects taking a matching placebo
Moreover, regression to the mean must be taken into account;  because our study was placebo-controlled, the regression to the mean was reduced because both groups   We found that training compliance was well correlated with improved visual acuity
Our results are in agreement with those of Zhou et al,  who showed that perceptual learning can improve visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in adult amblyopia  certified by peer review) is the author/funder
Therefore, software-based  training, combined with eye patching, may improve visual function in adult patients with amblyopia
  This phase , multi-center, clinical study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (for drug  treatment), parallel-group trial performed to assess visual acuity improvement in the amblyopic eye, as  measured by the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, following  weeks of  medication ( mg fluoxetine or placebo) and computer-based training (with the dominant eye patched)
For each game type, the corresponding weekly test  outcome measures were obtained by pooling the data from all individual games of that type played in that  The primary outcome of the study was an improvement in visual acuity in the amblyopic eye, as measured  by the ETDRS chart, from baseline (week , randomization) to the -week visit (end of treatment)
