Medically stable outpatients with depressive disorder (ICD-: F/F) as determined by the -item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score  and a score  on item  (Depressed Mood) were randomly assigned to receive either two sessions of HTB or PEP per week (- min) provided by two trained doctoral students
Main limitation: the number of dropouts in the PEP group ( of ) was far higher than in other trials investigating Conclusions: HTB seems to be a fast-acting, safe and easy accessible method leading to clinically relevant improvement in depressive disorder after two weeks; it is also Trial registration: German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) with the registration number Depression contributes to significant economic burden and is associated with comorbid diseases (i
In addition, a novel hypothesis describes that an evolutionarily ancient thermoafferent pathway, signaling from serotonergic sensory cells in the skin circuits in the brain, is dysfunctional in depressive patients, might explain the After we found HTB to be superior to a sham light therapy (), our primary objective was to compare the efficacy of HTB with a non-pharmacological physical exercise program (PEP), a proven effective standard intervention, according to guidelines for treatment discontinuation and adverse events (AE)) and feasibility of HTB applied in a vs PEP for patients with a diagnosis of depression according to ICD- (F/F) of at least four weeks duration
All the participants filled in a written informed consent form Eligible participants were to meet the following criteria: () Medically stable outpatients with a diagnosis of depressive disorder (ICD-: F/F; criteria for single or recurrent depression without psychotic features) confirmed by a physician or psychotherapist; () men and women between and  years of age; () a moderate level of depressive symptoms assessed with the -item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score  and a score  on item  (Depressed Mood) at screening and at baseline; () on a consistent antidepressant regimen or off antidepressant therapy for at least four weeks prior to baseline; () no changes in antidepressant treatment to be expected dissociative personality disorder, suicidal thoughts, abuse of alcohol or other drugs within the last six months, use of -blockers or corticosteroids, open wounds, heat urticaria, pregnancy, lactation, aversion to hot baths and participation in clinical trials in the eight weeks preceding the study
Demographic and other clinical data were also collected as part of the baseline assessment, such as gender, age, duration of depression, use of antidepressant drugs, history of depression treatment including past All eligible patients who consented to participate were allocated to HTB or PEP after baseline assessment in a : ratio by simple randomization without blocking or biometric center
In the HTB group, the core body temperature was measured directly before and after the bath and after resting; in the PEP group directly before and Unblinded assessments (IK, LD received prior training and were supervised by RH) were performed at the following three time points (for details see Table S): before start of HTB treatment (T), immediately on completion of the two-week treatment interval (T; after four treatments), according to results that effects are supposed to appear early () and at the end of treatment (T; after  treatments)
Further prespecified clinical secondary outcomes were: Severity and change in scores of subjective depression symptoms as measured by the BDI-II; sleep quality as assessed with the self-report PSQI after two and eight weeks
