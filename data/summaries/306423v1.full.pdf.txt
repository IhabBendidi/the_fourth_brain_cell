 This multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial evaluated the impact of the   x daily use of a HAP dentifrice without fluoride on the progression of enamel caries  in adolescent caries-risk patients subjected to orthodontic therapy, with a fluoridated  AmF/SnF dentifrice serving as a positive control
Primary study outcome was the  occurrence of enamel caries lesions  ICDAS (International Caries Detection and  Assessment System) code  around orthodontic brackets on the vestibular surfaces  of teeth - within the  days observation period
In the ITT analysis the  testing of the ITT as well as the PP data set proved that the caries preventive efficacy  of the HAP dentifrice was not inferior to the protection provided by the fluoridated  AmF/SnF control

As orthodontic therapy with fixed  appliances is known to be associated with an increased incidence of the overgrowth  of a caries-promoting microbiota [] and the development of white spot enamel  caries lesions [-], this study aimed at the assessment of the caries-preventive  impact of the regular use of a fluoride-free HAP dentifrice in this particular group of  caries risk patients
The  study hypothesis to be tested was, that, in terms of caries prevention, the regular use  of the HAP test dentifrice is not inferior to the regular use of a fluoridated control with  The investigation was designed as a multicenter, prospective, parallel group, two  arm, double-blind, randomized clinical non-inferiority trial to be performed at the  Dresden and Frankfurt
 Although up to three examiners were trained and calibrated at each study center  before the onset of the trial, at four centers the bulk of the practical evaluations was  performed by a single principal examiner (Munich % of all visits, Frankfurt %,  Regensburg  %, Wuerzburg  %) At the center in Dresden the principal examiner  Secondary outcomes were plaque coverage and gingival inflammation at baseline  Based on a reported caries incidence rate of about % in a preceding caries trial  assessing orthodontic patients with fixed braces, who were not beeing preselected  for particular caries-promoting risk factors [], the likelihood for the occurrence of an  ICDAS code  lesion during the  day observation period in this cohort of caries- streptococci was extrapolated to be p=% for the control group using the fluoridated  remix, or adapt this material for any purpose without crediting the original authors
 Also regarding the secondary outcome (ICDAS lesion  code ) the upper limits of  the % confidence intervals are substantially below the given non-inferiority margin  of % for both analysis sets (PP: %, ITT: %), indicating that again the HAP test  group has to be considered being non-inferior to the fluoridated control
It may be argued, that in the chosen setting of  capacities of fluorides and hydroxyapatite particles might have rendered a  assumption for the following reasons: In a more recent multicenter caries trial by  Sonesson et al (), assessing a comparable cohort of  adolescent patients  age - subjected to orthodontic therapy with fixed appliances, the regular use of a  highly concentrated  ppm fluoride dentifrice was accompanied by a significantly  lower incidence of white spot enamel lesions when compared to the regular use of a  standard  ppm fluoride control dentifrice []
