Kydd, Benjamin Thompson,  School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of Auckland, New Zealand (SSRIs) can enhance plasticity within the mature visual cortex and enable recovery from amblyopia
The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the SSRI citalopram combined with part-time patching of the fellow fixing eye would improve amblyopic eye visual acuity in adult humans
 logMAR or greater improvement in amblyopic eye visual acuity in the active but not the placebo block
Considerations for future trials include drug dose, Disruptions to binocular vision such as strabismus (an eye turn) or anisometropia (unequal refractive error between the two eyes) during the critical period of visual development can cause a neurodevelopmental disorder of vision called amblyopia [, ]
These treatments are effective [-], but efficacy appears to decline with increasing age in children [-], possibly due to a decline in neural plasticity as the visual cortex matures and exits the critical period for visual development [-]
;    demonstrates that vision can improve in adult humans with amblyopia through interventions such as monocular [, ] and binocular [-] perceptual learning and non-invasive brain stimulation [-]
A particularly striking result was reported by Maya Vettencourt et al [] whereby chronic administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine enabled recovery of normal visual cortex responses and visual acuity in mature rats with unilateral deprivation amblyopia
A significantly greater amblyopic eye visual acuity improvement in the fluoxetine compared to the placebo group was observed
However, Huttunen et al [] found no differences in visual function improvement between a group of adults with amblyopia treated for  days with combined perceptual learning and fluoxetine ( mg per day, n = ) and a group treated with perceptual learning combined with a placebo tablet (n = )
In this study we explored the effects of  weeks ( days) of the SSRI citalopram combined with fellow fixing eye patching on visual acuity, stereopsis and visually evoked retinal and cortical responses in adults with amblyopia
No significant effects of citalopram were observed, although our study may have been The single-site trial involved two blocks of fellow fixing eye patching each lasting two weeks separated by a two-week washout period
Pattern ERG (top) and pattern reversal VEP (bottom) results for the amblyopic (left) and The SSRI fluoxetine enabled recovery of vision in mature rats with amblyopia [] and has recently been reported to enhance the effect of patching in older children and adults []
;    found no effect of the SSRI citalopram combined with two weeks of patching on amblyopic eye visual acuity or a range of secondary outcome measures in adults with amblyopia
These results are broadly consistent with another recent study with a similar duration treatment period ( days) that reported no advantage of combining fluoxetine with perceptual learning compared to perceptual learning alone in adults with amblyopia []
We note that excluding this participant from the sample does not In conclusion, we found no effect of  weeks of combined citalopram and patching on amblyopic eye visual acuity in adults with amblyopia
