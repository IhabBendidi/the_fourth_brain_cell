To this end the current proof-of-concept study evaluated the feasibility, functional relevance and maintenance of a novel connectivity-controlled design high anxious subjects (n = ) underwent real-time fMRI-guided training to enhance connectivity between the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and the amygdala (target pathway) during threat exposure
Within this context, the emergence of real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rt-fMRI NF) training approaches that allow subjects to gain volitional control over regional brain activity have been considered as a potential of rt-fMRI NF by demonstrating that training success in terms of control over regional activity can be maintained beyond the training session (), and that training-induced neural activity changes can modulate emotional experience in healthy subjects () Initial studies have begun to evaluate the therapeutic potential of rt-fMRI NF in clinical regions such as the insula and amygdala can successfully decreased symptoms in patients with major depression ()
In line with current neuro-circuitry models of ER, successful down-regulation of the amygdala was accompanied by increased functional connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal regulatory regions in both, healthy subjects (, ) as well as Summarizing, the current literature suggests that (a) successful ER relies on top-down regulation of the amygdala via prefrontal regions and that (b) rt-fMRI NF-assisted modulation of these regions has the potential to modulate ER and anxious arousal In the context of recent circuit level models of ER (for circuit-level deficits in psychiatric disorders see ()), evaluating whether () rt-fMRI NF has the potential to directly allow regulatory control of the successful regulatory control decreases levels of anxiety in individuals with high anxiety, and () volitional control can be maintained in the absence of feedback and over a period of To increase the clinical relevance of the present proof-of-concept study while controlling for healthy subjects with high anxiety (trait anxiety scores > , assessed by STAI ()) were recruited
To control confounding effects of pre-training mood and anxiety states these were assessed additionally immediately before regulation nodes (EXP, right amygdala and right vlPFC, emotion localizer) and the bilateral motor cortices (SHC, bilateral M, motor localizer)
To increase the sensitivity of the offline connectivity analysis individual ROIs from the To evaluate whether NFT increased functional connectivity in the emotion regulation circuit, task-based functional connectivity was employed using a generalized form of context-not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in perpetuity
In line with our previous study we additionally evaluated training success by comparing differences in connectivity strengths between the first two and the last two Three subjects did not display above-threshold activity in the vlPFC during the emotional localizer and their data was thus excluded from all analysis, resulting in n =  for the final analyses
Examination of the pre-training data from the remaining participants confirmed the recruitment of subjects with high anxiety (reflected in high state anxiety scores) and did not reveal differences in pre-training anxiety and mood between training sessions (Table, paired Group-level analysis of the localizer tasks revealed that the emotional localizer reliably activated the emotional brain networks, including the amygdala and vlPFC (SPM one-sample t-test, whole-brain, False Discovery Rate (FDR) (), corrected p < 
We further explored the rate of non-responders (criteria: no improvements in primary neural and behavioral outcomes, n = ) and evaluated the training success in the responders (n = ), suggesting that determining putative responders may increase training success (details design to evaluate the feasibility, functional relevance and maintenance of a novel connectivity-based rt-fMRI NF approach as a strategy to strengthen emotion regulation and decrease anxiety
