;    Major determining factors for survival of patients with oral, oropharyngeal, and esophageal cancer are early detection, the quality of surgical margins, and the contemporaneous detection of residual tumor
Here, we explored the DNA repair enzyme PARP as imaging biomarker and conducted optical imaging in animal models, human tissues and as part of a first-in-human clinical trial Our data suggests that PARP is a quantitative biomarker for oral, oropharyngeal, and esophageal cancer and can be visualized with PARPi-FL, a fluorescently labeled small molecule contrast agent for topical or intravenous delivery
Using fresh oral cancer tissues within  min of biopsy, tumor and margin samples were correctly identified with >% sensitivity and specificity without terminal processing
In oropharyngeal cancer, we tested whether combining brush biopsy (a less invasive approach to obtaining diagnostic tissue) with PARPi-FL staining is a feasible approach to identifying tumor cells in a complex tissue sample
In oral cancer, we developed a staining and imaging method for freshly excised biopsies that allows for the identification of positive margins within minutes while preserving the fresh tissue for other downstream applications
Finally, we explore the potential to expand PARPi-FL imaging to in situ surgical guidance applications with a large surgical window after intravenous delivery in a large animal The presented studies are consistent in demonstrating the clinical relevance of PARPi-FL-based optical imaging methods for the early detection and intraoperative delineation of cancers that develop at the epithelial surface
;    To explore and confirm the clinical value of a PARP-targeted imaging approach in esophageal cancer, we quantified PARP expression in human surgical biospecimens (n=)
S, The ability of PARPi-FL to identify high and low PARP-expressing tumors was tested in four mouse xenograft models (ESO, OE, SKGT, OE) of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)
Quantification of the fluorescence intensity in tumor, esophagus, and thigh muscle showed a three-fold increase from the lowest (ESO) to highest (OE) PARP-expressing xenograft model, while fluorescence intensities in normal esophagus and muscle tissue were low and comparable in all animals (Fig
;    esophagus within  min of topical application and bind to PARP in cell nuclei without noticeable Expanding on whether PARP could be a relevant general biomarker to tumors of the oral cavity, we investigated PARP expression in a clinical data set of oropharyngeal cancer, which arises at the base of the tongue, tonsils, soft palate, or pharynx wall (n=)
We conducted a feasibility study to determine if brush biopsies in combination with PARPi-FL staining could enable rapid detection of tumor cells in cell suspensions derived from solid tissues
We found a significantly higher number of PARPi-FL-positive cells in tumor-derived suspensions than certified by peer review) is the author/funder
In addition, we were able to confirm these results in esophageal cancer cells (OE), which also showed a higher percentage of PARPi-FL-positive cells in tumor compared to tongue tissue and a significant uptake reduction after olaparib blocking (fig
Thus, this proof-of-principle experiment showed that PARPi-FL staining of a cell suspension derived from a complex tissue can help to distinguish between tumor cell containing and normal samples, encouraging further PARP expression during malignant transition and at tumor margins in oral cancer In oral cancer, we confirmed the gradual increase of PARP expression during malignant transition
Manual scoring yielded similar results, resulting in a sensitivity of % and specificity of % for the differentiation between benign/mild dysplasia and severe In presurgical biopsies (tumor: n=, benign tissues: n= subdivided into epithelium and deep margin from n= patients) and surgical specimens (n=), we quantified the difference in PARP expression between the tumor area, epithelium, and deep margin (Fig
;    Combining all oral cancer IHC datasets (three datasets, n= patients total) confirmed consistently elevated PARP expression in tumors and severe dysplasia, whereas a much lower expression was found in the epithelium and deep margin of normal oral tissue and benign and early dysplastic cases (Fig
;    Confocal microscopy images of tumor samples showed abundant nuclear PARPi-FL in areas identified as PARP-expressing tumor cells based on PARP IHC and H&E staining (Fig
In benign samples, nuclear PARPi-FL staining was confined to the thin PARP-expressing basal layer of the epithelium (Fig
Tumor cell nuclei in the human biospecimen samples were clearly identified based on their strong PARPi-FL staining, which was in alignment with H&E and PARP IHC (fig
SB revealed comparable image quality for tumor detection, including clear delineation of tumor cell nuclei and the PARP-expressing basal layer in margin tissue (Fig
This suggests feasibility of PARPi-FL injection during surgery to provide visual guidance, to identify tumor margins and certified by peer review) is the author/funder
In human biospecimens, and across all three investigated cancer types, we confirm that malignant tissues express significantly higher levels of PARP than normal epithelium and submucosal tissue, supporting our central hypothesis that PARP will yield high-contrast imaging as a diagnostic and resolution imaging has the potential to improve early diagnosis and surgical removal of tumors
Of particular translational importance, PARPi-FL-based differentiation of tumor and normal tissue in fresh human oral cancer biopsies could be achieved with >% sensitivity and specificity
Intuitively, the absence of terminal processing preserves the tissue for further applications following PARPi-FL imaging, We investigated PARP expression in esophageal cancer, consisting of adeno- and squamous cell carcinomas (stage T-T)
However, considering the various emerging optical imaging methods (), we believe that molecularly specific fluorescence contrast, as provided by PARPi-FL, combined with novel analytical devices and methodologies, has the clear potential to improve delineation and detection of oral and oropharyngeal cancer
Despite extensive clinical evaluation, adoption into clinical practice is still limited, partially due to the high cost of cytopathology as well as mixed reports about its sensitivity We evaluated whether a combination of brush biopsy and PARPi-FL staining is feasible in oropharyngeal cancer to identify and quantify tumor cells in a tissue sample
To establish a PARPi-FL staining method for brush cytology-like samples, we prepared a single-cell solution, certified by peer review) is the author/funder
We have shown feasibility of PARPi-FL in vivo diagnostics, based on our findings that intravenous injection provides a broad surgical window of at least - min post certified by peer review) is the author/funder
This is supported by numerous clinical studies involving green fluorescent dyes for surgical guidance, including the first first-in-Together, the versatility of PARPi-FL with respect to application, imaging settings, platforms, and technologies enables a combination of micro- and macroscopic evaluation techniques and thus a large range of applications, including screening, surveillance, biopsy guidance, fresh biopsy staining, in vivo diagnostic capability, and intraoperative margin delineation
