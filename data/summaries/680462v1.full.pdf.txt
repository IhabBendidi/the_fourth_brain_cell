Nicotinamide riboside augments the human skeletal muscle NAD+ metabolome and induces transcriptomic and anti-inflammatory signatures in aged subjects: a placebo-controlled, randomized trialInstitute of Metabolism and Systems Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK

To date, NR supplementation studies in humans have been  reported, focussing on cardiovascular (Martens et al, ), systemic metabolic (Dollerup et  al, ), and safety (Conze et al, ) end-points, but have not addressed advanced  aging, tissue metabolomic changes, or effects on muscle metabolism and function

This is consistent with the recent discovery that oral NR depresses  mitochondrial membrane potential while improving blood stem cell production in mice  Pathways upregulated upon NR supplementation prominently belonged to gene ontology  categories such as cell adhesion, actin cytoskeleton organization, and cell motility (Figure  riboside kinase b (Nrkb) in zebrafish skeletal muscle cell adhesion (Goody et al, )
 As it has previously been shown that NR increases glycolysis in mouse cardiac cells (Diguet  et al, ), and because our data do not support an NR-mediated transcriptional  upregulation of glycolysis related genes, we examined protein expression levels of glycolytic  enzymes in our muscle biopsies and show them to be unchanged after NR (Figure I)
