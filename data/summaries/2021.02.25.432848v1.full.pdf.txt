We evaluated (HCS) assays and Real Time Cell Analysis (RTCA), to compare two e-cigs (Vype ePen  and Vype eStick Maxx) and two THPs (IQOS and GLO) with the RF reference tobacco ciga-rette
All tests showed reduced cell viability following RF smoke exposure and slight or no reduction with ENDS at  hours compared to controls
In conclusion, NRU assay may be considered a suitable test, especially when combined with a time-resolved test, for assessing the kinetic of cytotoxicity induced by  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February ,

Significance Flow cytometric evaluation of apoptosis and necrosis of H cells exposed to RF cigarette smoke, THPs (IQOS and GLO), and e-cig (ePen and eStick) is shown in Figure 
Particularly, exposure to RF smoke significantly decreased H cell viability compared to AIR-HCI control starting from the th hour (p<

Data are reported as MFI percentage of Real-Time Cell viability analysis of H cell exposed to RF cigarette smoke, THPs (IQOS and GLO), and e-cig (ePen and eStick) was also evaluated immediately after the exposures for  h (Figure )
Exposure to eStick vapor showed a very different cell viability trend compared to AIR control and the other products
But this assay, as many other cell viability and toxicity tests, has its own limitations (The National  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February , 
Therefore, we compared the standard NRU assay with the MTT assay (i), Annexin V Apoptosis Assay (ii), with an updated version of the NRU assay combined with HCS analysis (iii) and, finally, with a RTCA technology (iv) to evaluate the performance of these tests in the assessment of cigarette smoke and ENDS vapor induced cytotoxicity in a whole smoke/vapor ALI-exposed model of bronchial epithelial cells (H)
Our results, independently from the test used, showed an overall reduced toxicity in bronchial epithelial cells exposed to ENDS vapor when compared to cigarette smoke exposure
The reduction of pH by cigarette smoke on the culture medium could explain the high viability detected by MTT assay compared to NRU assay with RF cigarette smoke, differently from ENDS vapor exposure, particularly for e-cig  (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted  a license to display the  in The copyright holder for thisthis version posted February ,
